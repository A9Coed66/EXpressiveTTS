in short, if everything goes according to plan, they may yet prove to be helpful.
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
traveler, not long after we met, i remember you mentioning that liyue, mondstadt and every nation has their own unique fashion.
thanks to captain gepard, we managed to keep our losses to a minimum. i'm sure people will begin to appreciate the silvermane guards after this battle.
indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. crafting careful and precise plans like this is simply not their style.
i wonder how many armories and arsenals there are on each of these planets
i have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. this was also part of grandpa's orders.
so high priest tribbie can be strict too
everyone expected my life to change after going through something huge like that.
has pascal been waiting for rivet town's evacuated residents to return?
i never had the chance to receive a good education as a child. that's why i hope to teach these children myself. hopefully i can pass on some of what i have learned.
this grand festival is drawing to its close. this is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in penacony.
this place will do. we can hide here while we keep an eye on the boat.
we were just talking to her in the museum do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
what? you want to secretly practice swordplay by yourself? dream on.
i've compiled the details into a written analysis. if you're interested, feel free to take a look.
dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. you make it sound like i'm some sort of wicked witch.
i'd be really upset if you lost it.
true but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
a gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. hehe don't you agree?
think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
then i'll show miss charlotte to my home for a little while.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
i'm starting to feel like something else is at play here. i think i'll pay a visit to his house and see if i can find any clues.
i know cocolia's style -- get everyone into a frenzy first.
as plans go, changing the deity's mind is a huge gamble to begin with. we can't expect to be in control of every last detail when we're facing off against a god, can we?
n--no, why would anything have happened?
for some reason, i feel like i can open up to you
the three zones are compartmentalized, so we're going to have to troubleshoot them one at a time. let's start with the energy supply zone. get ready, and then we'll go over.
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
it's just a minor error. this kind of thing was bound to happen. a small modification to the shogun should fix it.
in any case, let's take a bit more time to rest now.
i guess aurelie must have written all of this down in the hope that her records would one day be of use to investigators.
oh, so you must be the author of a legend of sword. i didn't expect to see others tagging along with you.
hmm? what's stopping you? not still traumatized from your last encounter, are you?
norbert probably didn't believe any of that nonsense -- i think he just wanted to prove himself and add more to his fortune.
ha, a small fry like that monster can't hurt me.
it also gives inayah shelter from her family it has brought us together after taking care of every single one of us.
i came to exact my vengeance. you tried to do my job for me, and i'm here to return the favor.
alright, alright, stop with the tantrum. you're not a kid anymore.
however, due to an order that was given many years ago, nobody has moved between the overworld and the underworld in a long time.
who are you? i don't remember you.
ah, speaking of which, miss eris was just looking for you -- why don't you go to the museum and talk to her?
when you've worked in intelligence for a long time, you'll understand that no one can stay on high alert forever. especially when he thinks he's about to win.
yeah, everyone gave it their all when it mattered most.
well aren't you lucky. as soon as i closed my eyes, i dreamt of endless running and circling and chasing after lady bailu it was even more exhausting than doing it in real life.
mm. i suppose i never expected that someone like me who was used to staying home would be promoted to such a position.
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
when that day comes, i can serve as your adviser. wouldn't that be nice?
legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, al-ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst
merchants already have enough challenges to deal with, and as paimon explained, my help was unconditional. please, sell your wares to me at the price you would sell them to any other customer.
hook, what's wrong? has someone been bullying you?
yes, at least according to mister svarog's calculations
the storage zone you passed through contains all our inventory, and is the main research center.
huh? strange, i remember no such thing.
this question surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us
the auction, the one at the vagrant camp?
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
this isn't going as planned what should we do?
perhaps, we can think of another way?
i had my secretary do some analysis. the current price of luminescent spines far exceeds the profits that could be made on the end product.
even if cirrus doesn't know where tail is, given the shared history, they wouldn't hesitate to cause trouble
herta called screwllum and i to the space station to discuss some important topics. she also sent an invite to stephen, but he didn't reply and herta didn't seem to want to wait any longer.
just answer me. when do you cry?
i don't know the details. she said she wanted to rest, and i have nothing pressing that requires her attention. so there is no reason to disturb her.
don't underestimate my experience.
it appears we are all present. the spiritfarers who were supposed to report to huohuo mentioned they didn't see her today.
hmm, that's true. anyway, since he asked for help, it's time to give those monsters a shock!
whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, i'll correct you. and if you're ever stuck in a rut, i'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
i'm guessing your informant told you that i'm just an incompetent merc with no real fighting skills, correct? i mean, that is what i said, after all.
i was worried that the excess of protection would make her feel uneasy, so i asked her to stay inside the palais. it's very safe in there.
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
contact the exalting sanctum. tell them, if they see a light in the sky, all units are to retreat immediately!
the things we believed and the experiences we had when we were young turn into our priceless treasures as we grow up.
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few it's just like a hidden message left by someone for the nameless.
i don't think so no one should be living here. i never saw anyone when i came here to hunt for supplies.
precisely. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
well, as luck would have it, i happen to be in a good mood today. how about i tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
i'm afraid this is nothing, benefactor
lady yuheng said they're fortune coins. go on, give them a rub, it'll bring you good luck.
all i remember is that this is a good place to while away the days~ still, many delves have changed beyond recognition since the arrival of the stellaron.
yo, ninja ruri! yo, silvergun shura!
yeah, have you seen engur, delavar, or jabari recently?
the forest of blessings this book has been recording simulanka's history all along
my thesis might just be related to the express... i hope you'll agree to be interviewed later -- i need first-hand information.
good, i've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the underworld.
well, can't say we didn't try.
but i'll try my best for lesser lord kusanali. if i can somehow use my abilities to help you, then count me in.
so, you relied on this rhetoric to manipulate the ignorant members of the vidyadhara into serving you?
as i explained, wangsheng funeral parlor was, once upon a time, more akin to a doctor's office than an actual funeral parlor.
we shouldn't discuss important matters out in the open.
i knew it. this will be a breeze for you.
maybe if you turned that frown upside down once in a while, he might feel more at ease.
don't blame yourself. the criminal is the one responsible here. the important thing now is to devise a plan to bring him to justice as swiftly as possible.
my bad. well, since you went through the entire ambrosial arbor crisis firsthand, dan heng and lieutenant yanqing, i'd like to discuss something with you.
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully
so... the trial of the heart means knowing how to deal with an overbearing boss.
think about it -- you helped me fix my machine the first time you came here, and now you're helping me the last time too that's called having a beginning and an end, right?
that's where the sanctification of tao du comes in! the eight adepts rose up to solve the crisis, and laid down a great magic array to purify tao du.
as a champion duelist, i've fought many battles, and taken a countless number of dishonored lives.
dongsheng bought some furniture from you at the beginning of the year. do you still have the invoice or any other record of that transaction?
yes, i did say that.
s--so, your memory module is okay?
wait, don't steal all the fried vegetables. leave some for me! hey!
some clients are behind on their payments again, and a few of the guys got themselves into trouble during their last job i'm not the boss, but somehow everything ends up being my problem
oh, there was a girl and her brother who said you saved their lives. you might want to check on them and see how they're doing.
i was always meticulous with the most menial of tasks. my mother always loved that about me.
paimon looks like she doesn't want to, so i'll carry a little extra. hehe, although i may not appear super strong at first glance, i actually do a lot of strength training on the regular.
it's just a guess, but there are also some footprints on the ground here.
only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.
or we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
the module used to detect emotions was frequently damaged, eventually turning him into a small robot that did nothing but collect parts.
sure you don't wanna reconsider? it's not too late to change your mind!
it sure is but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
i would save the jokes for later! as the saying goes, with great work comes great rewards. the ten-lords commission will compensate you accordingly.
but through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
you seem to know a lot, miss chevreuse. i assume you use these types of firearms on a regular basis?
i've always found it hard to handle complex relationships be it cocolia or my family.
no, oleg didn't assign that to me. but i've got a pretty good idea who it's gonna be.
xianzhou natives are more afraid of immortality than they are of the days coming to an end.
i am not without my doubts but watatsumi island is hardly affluent, and these supplies are a much-needed lifeline for us.
ah, i remember! the three outsiders! wait -- why are you still strolling around the city? do you know the silvermane guards are looking all over for you?
normally, the yuehai pavilion would be responsible for assessing the candidates. isn't that right, uncle tian?
i know she's used to going into the snow plains alone for research, and we've always believed she can protect herself
avoid entering someone's past memories lightly, especially hers.
and guess who arbitrated that case and handed down the sentence? none other than general jing yuan himself.
oh, i can help with that. one moment.
constantly communicating with people, trying to retain their morale, having to read between the lines, making sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve it's such hard work.
this place though, is where we can drop our cloaks of pretense, for the waters shall bring us closer together.
were were you upset, clorinde?
so you mean you're refusing?
let's open that package right here, right now -- then we'll see what he's hiding!
i could tell something was off the moment i stepped into this cave, so i kept an eye out. i've already dismantled the whole thing.
i won't treat you as hostiles, and in exchange, i hope you won't make things difficult when it comes to keeping secrets. i'll do what i can to find a way out.
the puzzle for you to solve is to use the limited number of thermic cores at your disposal to illuminate all of the designated snowshine lamps scattered around the victory zone.
i gotta say, it does intrigue me, the way we all ended up here together.
it seems like the craftsmen are too afraid to go in, but they have nowhere to run to either. we should take care, benefactors -- something terrible must have happened.
hmm, interesting so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
it is certainly unusual for us to meet in a place like this, but as lisa said, i'm glad to see you.
oh? well then i'll give you a chance. defeat me, or hand over all your swords.
maybe it's because she left home early she realizes that dreams, while enchanting, are ultimately just that -- dreams.
this trolley can raise and lower, and even rotate, ensuring that the box will face in the right direction.
if you are unashamed of such disgraceful action, then you are also unworthy of the tenryou commission itself! do i make myself clear!?
i just couldn't believe that he never lifted a finger to oppose cocolia's order to seal the passageway
don't worry. now that you're at the alchemy commission, i'll do my best to find a solution.
what are you so afraid of, honestly? we're finally about to meet the true author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." aren't you excited?
hmm then, why don't we go back to sumeru city and ask the blacksmith?
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
this is precisely why when entering the plane of euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
alright, dismissed. go and report to general gorou. and remember there can be no more insubordination.
at this time, cowell arrived in the tunnel, having heard that strange noise, and caught lyney red-handed.
yes, the artisanship commission and alchemy commission conducted a joint examination and found that the parts of this machine are made from specially refined borisin bio-tissue.
the fragmentum corrosion is weaker here... i wonder what's controlling it?
craft a mask based on a personality type
now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!
such is the herta company culture
seriously? you're questioning me like this is a court case now. i don't know anything about that.
i'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
of course! everyone in natlan is rooting for you.
hmm i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection why would they come after me?
hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," urakusai.
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream we can just head to the place i mentioned later
if you know nothing about martial arts, why were you smirking earlier?
those guys can't think outside the box. of course they can't wrap their heads around my design. *sigh* i thought it was something big. leave it here. i'll take a look.
but mister svarog doesn't like talking to others, especially wildfire
i'm a professional fighter. my martial school has always emphasized the importance of refined control.
this way this is where we part ways. all of this is like a nightmare.
you are quite the swordmaster, young man.
it looks like he still has a place for her in his heart.
the past few days have been some of the most challenging work i've ever taken on.
am i? maybe it's because i had the other shrine maidens leave. anyway, i've always been like this.
the trust that these four fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the wisdom orb.
unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...
oh, come on you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
but i just don't know can i really take on such a huge responsibility?
never mind. it would seem the time has come for other means of dismantling the xianzhou from within
beelzebul is ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. baal's name was "makoto."
lisa, we need to establish some ground rules if we do end up apprehending any drunken troublemakers, no electrocutions. okay?
because of the nihility, i'm rarely affected by the power of other paths, but somehow i can unconsciously infiltrate them... maybe that's the "risk" they're trying to avoid.
by the way, i've just noticed you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
parting with a friend like that is too sad, and she never wanted that to happen.
as for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? if the ipc tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!
yes, and no.
i heard it, too! our ears aren't messing with us. there was definitely a beep, but it sounded like it was coming from inside my head!
really!? then where is the real satelleden? will i have the chance to go see it with the express?
you're still talking big but sure, if that happens, i'll stay true to my word.
sometimes, you have to strike hard and fast at just the right moment to expose the lies while avoiding any unwanted interference.
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
alright, after some discussion, you decide to turn around and head out of the city
one day, this rage will ignite and burn me alive. i will become the very monster that the reignbow lux arrow hunts
well, it means you'll soon end up like her, unable to speak ever again.
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
i'm going into town to check the progress of the fireworks setup. i'll return shortly.
after all, the master should be the one who is most aware of their student's strengths and weaknesses.
ugh, i'm not that big of a baddie you know
oh, is that so? and if i may ask, what did you hear while you were inside your box?
it's nice to see you all again, astral express crew. i heard my disappearance caused quite the commotion out there i'm really sorry about that.
well then. i look forward to both of your contributions.
you say that but do i see your ears saying otherwise?
treat it as a layer of protection. this will shield my research and your personal safety. once the problems have been dealt with, i'll give you the antidote.
yes. they attach themselves to sentient beings, feeding off their host's experiences and emotions.
thank you. i'll be in my room.
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
your story is one that has captivated me. i really do have high hopes for you please do your best to live up to them, child.
haha i have my reasons.
i never leave a question unanswered. i am a ninja, aka rappa.
you sure you wanna brave the desert alone? i mean, it's your choice at the end of the day, but still
to strike your foe takes unity between mind, arrow, and bow.
wait, gepard! listen to me--
lady bailu! lady bailu, where are you?
"doesn't have a lot of mora to his name" okay, let's keep going.
memokeeper did you think you could just leave?
the akademiya's grip isn't long enough to reach all the way to port ormos, so the city's a little more laid back, meaning the population's also a mixed bag. you never know who you'll meet there.
i have some preparations to make first. could you bring my clothes to my room, please?
anyways, what i'm trying to say is that we're seeking ways to remove the influence of the stellaron and the fragmentum.
well then. the door is open. hop on in.
i see. well, it just so happens that today's sabzeruz festival is almost over, too.
hmm, a most opportune outcome.
thinking back, even if she wasn't too affected by my absence, i do feel guilty.
this place is an endless stream of people where do we start?
all in the name of vengeance, no need to thank me.
but there are some things i find difficult to forget. i feel it's only right that i tell you what's on my mind before we part ways.
he offered me a pile of mora, so i just signed on
heh, it's quite understandable to be hungry for top talent.
that's okay. this one is not for profit.
that won't be necessary. i've memorized every detail.
but why would they kidnap a kid who just spends his days living in the country and raising aphids? he's only in his twenties. what would they want with him?
i've never visited a place filled with such vitality and happiness
so you can try working together with others as well as long as you can see them, hehe.
mhm. "father" is very capable, and also trustworthy.
looks like you're facing a difficult choice once again.
we have such a good relationship, so surely you won't mind?
hmm five days ago, you say
can a creation become what it wants to be? the answer is "yes"! i'll grant your wish, guyun, and transform you into something different.
that's not true, guyun. that nameless swordmaster shaped his own destiny, so you can too.
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
i just want to tell stories from the past: stories about aeons that have fallen.
all the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that i added to our novel?
you're welcome, and there's no need to be so polite. you learned fast!
there's no point in resisting, mister norbert. your accomplices have been subdued. there's nowhere to run.
there's nothing to be worried about! just take a step forward, and give yourself a chance.
now, we just need to see where your fate no, "our fate" leads us.
things are quiet in watatsumi island at the moment, and i wanted to buy some books. so, i decided to make the trip here.
okay i get it. i'll make a trip to qlipoth fort and tell bronya what i really think.
it's been a while since i've visited the citadel of regzar. i'll catch up with chief for a bit before i head back myself. he really did a lot for me in the past.
i'm alright now. you don't have to accompany me any further. the butterflies that i felt from before are all gone now.
yes, had he drunk the poisonous wine, he still would've faced serious health consequences despite taking the antidote. he didn't hesitate to put himself in harm's way to achieve his goal.
i mean after all, the only thing we can control right now is our choice at this very moment.
yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
don't forget, she's on the ipc's most-wanted list -- a fugitive that nobody can seem to pin down and now we've become her prey while she stalks us in the shadows.
would you like a cup of tea? i can go make one for you.
no. no one's completed the task yet why, has something happened?
people of the underworld, i dare not ask for your forgiveness -- i now know the reality of your decade of suffering
no wonder wildfire and the silvermane guards were never able to find gears and wisdom
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid i can't even imagine what it must look like.
i say "virtually" because of skott, of course lucky for us, he wasn't as smart as he thought he was.
ugh let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
speaking of which, how are things with the whistling flames?
hmm. narrative devices are truly mysterious things.
hah. should i respect the shallow sense of time and condescension to mortals that has caused them to delay in moving against us qixing?
remember, it's often the unassuming pawns -- the lone traveler or the worm that subdues the dragon -- that leave even the best strategists helpless.
do you not know how to wield a blade? or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
haha, we're of the same mind.
i think you should wait outside. you've already been corrupted by the devorator once. it could easily re-enter your mind and take control of your body.
she spends all her time alone. having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
only the best! and i've learned a lot, too!
that sounds fantastic. i've got a couple of other things to attend to right now, though, so why don't i come back some other time, and we can chat over a drink?
if that's the case, it can only have one goal: to trap us here until we die. what else could it be?
i was a little apprehensive actually, i was wondering how i could convince you if you refused at first
now that was intense! i can't remember the last time i had so much fun.
you are a high-profile figure within the knights of favonius. as his commanding officer, i have a duty to make sure no misunderstandings arise between you.
if you can defeat the ringmaster selected by the xianzhou, you'll not only win rewards and prizes but also be making a name for yourself.
here we are again. what kind of song are you in the mood for now?
this is the grand narukami shrine, after all. ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the shogun herself
i don't want to disturb him. this installation was accidentally damaged by two of the vagrants. if mister svarog finds out, they'll get in big trouble
hmph so you want to go out in a blaze of glory.
what happened to that confidence of yours?
it looks like someone used it and then destroyed it -- possibly kafka.
as you approach the battlefield, you see numerous people lying by the side of the road. they appear to be dressed like guards.
this is one problem that even the musou no hitotachi will not be able to solve.
but once the fatui became involved, things got a whole lot more interesting i thought i might have the chance to catch a big fish.
the more the merrier, these guys are nothing! hold the line!
your voice echoes through the dark hall, but the only response you receive is the sound of water dripping from the ceiling.
this is your handwriting, arlan!
so, miss navia was right the goddess of prophecy didn't tell us anything about the future.
whether it's a one-off or not, it's a boundary that i've committed to no longer cross.
that indulgent feeling of being spoilt for choice between countless different varieties that, to me, is the appeal of shopping.
if you got any broken equipment lying around you can always come find me, though i can't guarantee i'll be interested in fixing it.
it symbolizes a chance to introduce ourselves to the cosmos once again -- a heroic kingdom that survived both the legion and the eternal freeze with tenacity.
well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. you're right on time, too.
of course! for your safety, i want to ensure that everything you see is manageable. i don't want you to lose your mind in the simulation!
there's an accounting book lying on the ground. it must have been specially placed there by sparkle.
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
amazing, absolutely amazing! even the long-lived might not witness something like this in their lifetime! i'm so lucky!
as well as traveling with the caravans to ensure essential goods are delivered without incident, we have to investigate suspicious locations to eliminate any emerging threats.
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
hmm when i wrote the letters, i heard that dehya was in port ormos, and alhaitham was at the akademiya.
well, i guess that's that. we're on our own now. let's keep going.
to put it simply, we were afraid that our shows would lose their meaning if people couldn't understand them
shoulda, coulda, woulda, seele! activating the gear bridge alone would've been enough to expose us.
she even factored my immaturity into her plan.
what happened? the supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and gepard had to rush back to the front line i don't understand
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
did you by any chance hear a voice speaking to you before you got here, miss kirara?
how about this? i'll stand in for your dear sister at events -- surely you don't want the world to hear the charmony festival's been called off?
hold on, i said "we," didn't i? no need to say goodbye, because you're coming too.
even so, himeko indicated that the source of stellarons remains mysterious, and there are no realistic ways to remove a stellaron's contamination.
you mean, like those music boxes with dancing figures? i think i've seen one or two from the merchants in sumeru.
you're one to talk, setting up endless scenarios in the divination commission!
so that's why you wouldn't understand how hard it is for a bad person to try to be good. it's impossible for me, and i have no intention of acting like a good person.
so, he's recommended three candidates. their names are: qianwei, mingbo, and zhiyi.
the aftermath of stormterror's last attack is finally settled for the moment.
nothing escapes your attention, miss navigator.
don't look so worried! i'm not throwing you another mission.
go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. if you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move.
scholars are fond of it, but as you can see, there aren't many scholars still studying around these parts. no seller would be able to make a profit here.
look, it's common sense and easy, right?
when are you planning to head back? do you need us to escort you?
you mentioned appropriate compensation. perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
who would have imagined that i would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? no, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
let's see which adeptus shall we visit first?
the sole reason i held this auction is to reclaim my treasured possessions.
if you wouldn't mind, we'd like an explanation.
i'm lead researcher of herta space station. but honestly... i'm more like madam herta's "housekeeper" of this place.
so you've made it your daily mission to tease me, huh?
in order to quell the situation, chief oleg brought wildfire into the mine and left me in charge of security for the towns. but the situation in the mine is critical -- i have to back him up.
i was planning to go after i finish my work, but the work keeps piling up i ended up completely forgetting about it.
hehe. i had to. i wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
well anyway, there's a dangerous situation at the divination commission at the moment, so just don't go in there!
but don't worry aeur" if you run into any trouble, i'll be there faster than you can say "gold-level courier of the komaniya express"!
at least we'll get to see some amazing scenery along the way, right? besides, we'll have each other. it'll be a shared experience that we'll never forget.
a long time has passed since i wielded this sword the heat of combat nearly cast me into the darkness.
no, there can't be mister svarog is healthy, his system is always being maintained.
general feixiao just slipped out of the recovery room. she thinks she's so sneaky, but i know everything that happens in the alchemy commission.
just like at cloudford, stargazer navalia's meridian pin has malfunctioned. the checkpoint there is abandoned and the garrison is scrambling to locate the stellaron.
you are forbidden from leaving the sky-faring commission until the aforementioned questions have been investigated.
ahem! only a true marechaussee hunter is capable of passing through this final door.
remember, all we need are some wide zoom shots of the streets. if you happen to find some particularly lovely patches of flowers and grass, feel free to grab some close-ups of those as well.
in my role as champion duelist, my opinions do not matter. for when i draw my blade, i am but an instrument of fontaine's law.
back already? you've met with jing yuan and wandered around for a few hours. so, what do you think?
excellent, then let's start with the scenery shots. kamera and clapper loader, you're up.
three, two, one mung beaaaan!
wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
if so, then you underestimate me. i am quite well-informed about the vision hunt decree.
although faith is more important to the vast majority, there are still quite a number of citizens who care more about their worldly possessions.
before she retired, she told me, "for as long as you live, never forget what dance means to others."
anti-raiden shogun training. i've prepared a special program, just for you. come along now.
hmph, over two hundred years, and not a single lasting connection. this is my punishment, huh
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return
ah, a word of advice for you before we part ways -- a word of warning from someone who's been in your shoes before
illustrious names? uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
also, i don't consider you a loner. oh, i don't mean him, but rather behind you
powering the audience system alone required me to reconfigure the energy supply of the entire space station! i had to switch it to hibernate mode before rebooting everything. do you have any idea how much that costs?
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
therefore i shall allow you to leave tenshukaku alive
people would think i've lost grip on the gravity of the situation. that's why i can only do this in private.
so you've been watching us from the very beginning?
yae publishing house has released numerous works that lay out military strategy in a simple and pragmatic way. those are my favorite.
seems like someone wants to make things difficult for us. let me see if i can pry it open
keep him with you. do not let him slip away.
afterward, he said to the dendro archon, "i miss my parents, my wife, and my children. i've been away from home for far too long. they must be worried."
jokes cannot conceal your true intentions. opportunities are fleeting and you've just wasted one.
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
oh yeah? well, since you think it's so easy, you can sign them for me.
quite a downpour nothing will get done until it clears. let this be a lesson to those who yesterday said, "i'll do it tomorrow."
okay, now move the kamera slowly.
aaeur"a butterfly? was it on my head?
not bad. i suppose this is a step forward for you. but i'm afraid
after troubling you all this time, i couldn't leave without properly expressing my thanks. here's a dream bubble for you -- i hope you enjoy it.
this shrine looks somewhat familiar.
the sofas here on the express are too comfy. after falling asleep even my dreams are soft and cuddly.
drifting memory fragments
of course, what makes this even crueler is that you managed to convince yourself there was "no other way." uncle tian was always going to give you this opportunity even if you'd done nothing at all.
three devices in total. and look, the light converges in one place. albedo, are we able to deactivate the shield from here?
allow me to introduce him to you: this is boothill, a galaxy ranger.
the tenryou commission is experiencing a large turnover of personnel in very difficult circumstances. we really are short on people. i apologize for not having tended to your friend's request on time.
let me remind everyone that we are at a hearing. mister president, please share with us your vision for aurum alley.
here's my little partner in crime. souka named it "blitzara" aeur" i think it's rather good. very distinctive.
i have business to attend to in the palace of astrum -- the rest is up to you. convince the old shopkeeper, and you may just become the new heroes of aurum alley.
dan heng, could you please find the incense burner? the incense smells wrong.
let's go, sam sampo?
so we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
madam yukong! after thirty years, we find ourselves fighting side-by-side once more!
does this not clear all doubt?
good point! may as well see it through!
you're probably right. i know my lady's personality, and she wouldn't deliberately keep something like this from us.
while one team is on duty, another is resting, and a third team is on standby in case of emergencies.
the assessment process comes to an end here, uncle tian. in my opinion, zhiyi is not suitable for the position. but qianwei and mingbo both have potential.
guuji yae, i'm a little curious aeur" does it not also dishonor the shogun to hide a wanted criminal at her grand shrine?
although i met guizhong a few times, i never knew anything of this particular story
as someone who sought to hurt others for his own gain, florian lost that right long ago.
to put it simply, makoto wasn't concerned about outcomes.
there's something wrong with the stuff this guy is shipping -- it's causing damage to other people's goods, and our dock here is liable for the compensation
oh? more approachable and appeasable than you'd imagined?
umm let me put it this way. i was just worried that you might be getting weary, and if you keep pressing on in that state, you might start to lose sight of the things that made you want to start your journey in the first place.
it's not that i don't want to. it's just that i can't... i've come so far, and i can't sum up all of that in just a few words.
ah well, that's, uh all in the past now
nothing else you wanted to add? let's leave it there then. time to go.
and so, the theater wants to host a celebration event.
there are wandering monsters nearby -- they'll spell trouble if we let them hang around. go take care of them -- your victory is certain.
since you clearly understand, perhaps you could think about making an effort, too.
uncle tian is too modest. he's been around for a long time. there's no one who can replace a person of such noble character.
mm. but what you haven't heard is that it's currently very close to you -- a couple of warp jumps away, in fact.
since i'm returning to the xianzhou, i think it's better to choose something unrelated to the alliance. feel free to pick a few for me.
as much as i'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, i suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
mister luka, come take a look. this is the tuskpir treatment that i've prepared for you.
wait, so everyone found out that i?
but no matter where their hearts and bodies may be, they will always be family.
you need money for your family, right? take this and show it to a knowledgeable buyer, and they'll instantly know how valuable it is.
jepella brotherhood... i've heard that name somewhere...
but, there is a place we could check aeur" ochkanatlan, the ruins we now refer to as "cinder city."
great, let's head back and fix the cart.
i see so mavuika has asked you to forge an ancient name for an outlander. that certainly would be an unprecedented feat.
of course you may, but you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes" i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
although we now know why he took them, there are still many unanswered questions. for example
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
as long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
you've been running so many errands lately -- i'd like for you to take some useful items away with you.
now that that's settled, let's go pay a visit to the museum lobby secretary, eris. she's a talented worker and can tell you everything there is to know about museum matters.
yes, i've been preparing myself mentally for a long time. if i back out now, it'll be a huge loss.
mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
i have no questions about the case, but i'm just curious how did sparkle manipulate you?
this food street is great. it really captures that urban feel of chihu rock.
we'll never find the oracle pillars in all this mess!
poisson was just involved in a disaster, so it's presently devoid of people. that naturally makes it the best choice.
i know that, gepard. don't worry, i've thought this one through for a change.
considering even their visions have been taken from them and embedded in the statue, they are ultimately quite helpless.
huh. so it's selling slowly? why is that?
combine the adepti sigils with the wonder cores and insert them into the jade chamber's control compartment.
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
alcohol has a way of making people share what they really think, so engur and delavar are always rambling in the tavern about how king deshret is a superior deity.
isn't this your time off? you should do something that isn't too mentally taxing.
did you at any moment think about what i would feel if something happened to you?
give precious things to the "greedy spirit" in the sea is that what we have to do?
is that so... you're good then. what sort of training did you have to undergo? can you teach me?
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley
that way, even if the front line were to collapse the fragmentum monsters wouldn't be able to make it to the other side.
he doesn't look like the type, but that sounds about right.
as you begin to survey the man's condition, you're immediately able to see past the crude dressing on his leg and assess the inside of his wound.
your understanding of the layout of stores and vendors is most detailed.
so arlan did go to see professor capote. this is the evidence.
you're with the astral express?
now now, this is a grown-up situation, okay? it's not fun and games anymore. and don't try and follow me.
i don't need any help here, why don't you try asking someone else?
mister sunday has done some serious research on his suspects... this traitor must have been causing trouble for the family for a long time.
mingxi, please ready your statement.
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
the battle is still far from over.
the moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
ever since i was adopted by the kujou clan, you taught me the importance of loyalty from servants to their superiors
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
master xingqiu, i would like to borrow a few of your staff to escort the thief to the ministry of civil affairs. as for the bounty, we will pay you afterward.
i considered this matter worthy of my attention. so i pursued them, and they led me here, where i happened to run into you.
at first, it was but the size of one room. now, it is large enough to blot out the moon in the skies above liyue.
(oh no judging by the atmosphere, clorinde and navia are probably thinking something similar. the mood just got super awkward all of a sudden)
what would you do if a sum of mora like that suddenly landed in your lap?
a "warp trotter" that's a pretty rare aether spirit but they were acting kind of strange in the battle -- is there something wrong with them?
at a critical moment, someone distracted the monsters and led them away. just when all hope seemed lost, the tide turned.
hmm, there seems to be quite a market for this ahem, never mind. let's get ready, and start the game.
i might not know all the stories and legends, but i know a legendary sword when i see one.
interesting. your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
gentlemen, our preliminary inspection shows that there is indeed hidden biological tissues inside, just like the craftsman feared.
well then, i will take care of the cirrus situation. as for what gets written in the luofu's ghostly grove, i'll leave that up to you.
i looked everywhere and couldn't find him, so i checked the security department's work plan records. this is what i found!
while you may have good character, do you have any value? don't take that the wrong way, i'm genuinely asking you. you might have some value, i just don't know about it.
you can trust me. i know our paths have only crossed once before, but my intuition tells me you guys are good people. and i've got good intuition by the way, haha.
getting a move on already? i would've thought you'd at least wanna spend some time with that cartridge you were obsessing about.
clouds knights don't visit the ambrosial arbor without a reason, plus i'm new here
no, i meant, if you're going to analyze the facts, count me in.
i've never spoken to the general, but i did meet his retainer once. he asked me if i was a "woman of the sword," so you know what i did? i did a sword-swallowing performance right in front of him!
this is miss kuki shinobu, whom i've recommended to you before.
my earliest memories are of living with master. according to her, she saved me from certain people of ill repute. my birth parents had left me behind some time before that.
i sincerely apologize, but i cannot approve knight klee's request for time off.
so far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream.
well when i arrived here yesterday, grandpa almond told me all about the state of this world. since they think of me as their forest fairy, i just felt like i had to try to help them.
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
yes. he told us that we have to shut down the theater within thirty days, and that it's going to be demolished
we're all like neighbors, so we're always helping each other out. it's easy to forget that everyone's running a business.
here. have a taste of my cooking.
hehe, i felt so guilty at first, like i always owed someone something. i was always thinking of ways to repay others.
it will be easier for us to start with someone from inazuma.
since returning to the luofu, i've been buried in work. there are only three things that bring me joy: eating food, making perfumes, and teasing qingque.
a fitting end to the tale of the departed -- one could not ask for a better farewell. go on, they're all here.
may the wind carry our blessings and praise.
who's this old guy with a white beard?
this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
madame kujou, this is rather serious. i believe you owe watatsumi island an explanation?
hello, students. i'm very happy to be hosting the dreamlight anniversary this year.
let me tell you something. there were two mutes, but one is dead now, and the other though he's still in penacony, i'm afraid you'll never find him again.
that's true. and that's why i'm also here for another purpose -- to visit hoolay.
during the hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the grand narukami shrine. having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
why? because he dethroned azar from power?
the hatred in one's heart might dissipate one day, but the way of the ninja within their hearts will never be forgotten ever.
this area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. i guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
that i'd like to do? why are you asking?
yes. congratulations on your victory, sangonomiya kokomi.
she's his "family" did you really forget?
stand down, moze. i am here, hoolay. what do you wish to say?
huh? you don't dream? ever?
i've never been great at maintaining relationships. besides, anyone i've ever worked with probably couldn't wait to get rid of me
i have awaited your arrival with great anticipation, and thoma assures me that you do indeed possess the power to change the tide of the times.
honestly, i feel that girl is hiding something from me. i knew cocolia well, and she was never one to suddenly change her mind.
ayato told me that we've already confirmed the dates for some inazuma-fontaine cultural exchange events.
rehearsals are exhausting if you keep your nose to the grindstone, you're going to wipe yourself out sooner or later.
mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
it's probably more accurate to say this was never a real scripted story to begin with.
but he's not the only evil ninja in this realm, right?
it's alright, monsieur neuvillette. given their confidence, i expect they've found the crucial evidence.
you're not wrong hold on! why do i still hear you in my head?
its great weight meant that it hit osial with incredible force, while the energy within triggered that spectacular explosion.
first to find gets to stake their claim. seems fair.
this calls for brainwaves, not "brawnwaves." how about i take you over myself?
sure enough! these parts are from the museum's sculpture!
as for "genius," don't mention that word to me again.
such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, but as a means to an end i need to put this aside for a more indifferent process.
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
just come back once in a while. you will always be welcome at the space station -- just don't stay for too long.
when the stellaron was extracted, even for that brief moment, it corroded the space station and formed a new space -- what we now call the fragmentum.
it was my mistake to make an unwarranted request without considering your own wishes.
there's a bunch of crates piled over there. maybe we can find what we're looking for.
i heard that azar and his cronies fell from power, and alhaitham told me that now was a good time to find a job in the akademiya, but only if i wanted to.
waeur"well. your denial is very strident, i'll give you that! but what proof do you have to back your claims?
hmph. who did that uncivilized rabble think they were, disturbing my enjoyment of the arts?
alright, then. good night, everyone. and don't go thinking that granny itztli doesn't like hanging out with you just because she's not around all the time.
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
kind, as always. however, our intention doesn't necessarily change the containment device and the type of implement we need.
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
little gui, this is official business -- it's nothing like the street fights we're always dealing with. you can stop being so excited
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
yes, she works at yuehai pavilion, and she's my junior. how can i help her?
i understand now when you saw that carving, you were reminded of your friend.
they're all just *burning* remembrances a stark contrast to this deep sea.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
but then again, gifts should be lasting. what about a delightful new bouquet of flowers on the table each day? wouldn't they do a better job at brightening up someone's day?
if you want to release a xiao lantern, come and find us anytime.
i see well, thank you for being sincere. in itself, it's a comfort to me.
feel free to hang out here for a bit. it'd be nice if you could also get to know some other people at the theater!
how often do you get the chance to work with yourself? just imagine how in sync we'll be with one another we're bound to thrive and prosper!
a simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. it even allows me to verify my own existence.
it looks like the sky here has changed somewhat.
yes. exactly. very to the point.
okay why?
i can also reward you as compensation for being my assistant. i will fulfill your every wish.
she runs a regular q&a column in "that's life" magazine. the people of inazuma absolutely adore her.
if you had informed me sooner, there'd be plenty of room for us to
but the oratrice handed out that verdict unilaterally, and it has been operating independently ever since it was first created.
come on, first thing off the top of your head. how would you spend it?
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
then, how can i ask inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
these kids found way more than we did fixing all those robots what an embarrassment
one question per person, remember? the little one doesn't count.
ooh, i would love naeur"no, no need. that would be needlessly indulgent.
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
three, two, one cheeeese!
the marechaussee phantom found bonnie and the lefevere pendant at pierre's residence. that was the beginning point of our investigation.
now i just need to take some time to give this proposal some polish
morning can someone fetch me a cup of coffee? more milk, hold the sugar.
that's wonderful. i'll be looking forward to your cooking during our adventures together.
let's do this. i may never have come face to face with it, but this stellaron cost me a nice, stable job. it's time to get even.
i never imagined that something i learned about unexpectedly would become the key to connecting everything.
the answer lies with the three of you. i'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
it can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
yeah you could be right about that. is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
huh him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
restricted area? since when were you in charge of fyxestroll garden?
living in a world like that would be a dream come true!
i wonder if you'd be interested in seawater magma flavored pastries
also, i believe that there is no such thing as a wiser or more enlightening performance.
this way, i can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
oh? such a hasty refusal. do you think that's wise? goodness, who knows what tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it
sure enough, no one knows about miss robin. i'm not surprised.
even you benefactors have probably lived longer than me.
your analysis is accurate. however, in my humble opinion, now may not be the best time to call the harmony shogunate for aid.
we can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. but you're more attuned to it than i am.
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
no need. this is merely a memokeeper's duty.
of course, after all, she was a landau!
when that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me ei. i'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
"acheron..." merely a borrowed name. you know my nature, remember my deeds... thus, i am acheron.
ready? my stomach's always ready for food and drink!
so when i say this "curse" is just a figment of the imagination, i say it with more certainty than most. but i also can't really go telling people that the ancient plagues were real, or it would incite panic.
you made it i thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
i'm sorry if i'd known i wouldn't have got you to come with me. you'd probably be there by now if you'd gone by yourself
don't fret. all amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
so lyney proceeded to knock him out too before stuffing him into that box.
he only wants everyone to return safely to rivet town and live their peaceful lives like before.
you'd better rest up and regain your strength before we settle things, lessig.
yes, that's right! i'm very sorry, everyone. i will take my leave!
if you don't have any plans in the immediate future, why not stay in mondstadt for a while? we'll be celebrating the weinlesefest very soon.
ugh, it's ghostly grove, not ghastly gravy!
no sleep for you either, huh?
but gorou rarely buys anything. so as a favor for me, i'd like to ask you to accompany him.
with so many competitors in this line of work, laziness will only net you an empty stomach.
i was supposed to be a mediator, but uh i might've gotten a little too involved just now. anyway, one of those two should probably start talking.
i believe in your potential. it is rare for someone to have such a carefree, optimistic disposition.
sorry to interrupt. we're actually members of the, uh liyue anglers association, and we just wanted to ask a few questions about someone.
even without opening it, you can tell from the mora and jewels scattered around the chest that it must contain quite the fortune.
gepard, look! the miners have put up a makeshift defensive line!
in those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
so. what does dodoco do after getting to inazuma?
a warm reminder, benefactors, that the artisanship commission is as important to the xianzhou as the divination commission.
these memory fragments are as fine as dust, and can't form memory bubbles. they're hard to see with the naked eye -- even most memokeepers can't sense them.
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
you seek to crush human nature underfoot while masquerading as an as an arbiter and a god! i cannot let you!
my stay in exalting sanctum was supposed to be focused on treating people and delivering medicine, but the seat of divine foresight tasked me with analyzing the prescription i've been severely delayed.
signing off now! time to get some songwriting going~
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
a show of unprecedented splendor is about to be staged in penacony. if you're too late to take the stage, you can work behind the scenes.
alright, i'll stand next to you and monitor your connection to the ley lines. it shouldn't take long, but you need to look out for one thing.
huh. i wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
i trust my intuition more than any words.
but don't keep your fungus waiting much longer look, now that it's no longer under the wisdom orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
hmm we still need to ask pascal why he was stealing parts in the first place.
stay right there. you have a lot of explaining to do.
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
in the meantime, she'll have to learn to withstand the darkness -- just as i have.
let me tell you how it is. we're investigating dakan al-ahmar, and we're gonna put an end to their operations.
alright. no more questions. i hope i didn't take up too much of your time. let's continue on our way.
breaking the covenant of our alliance will bring war upon the vidyadhara. even if we are able to have offspring again, what difference will it make?
which is why i thought it would be more appropriate to ask you to introduce me first.
speaking of which, most of the guards who report directly to the six sages belong to the corps of thirty, but they have a completely different reputation.
you did quite admirably. i could see your determination and your hard work.
ah, no i was just up late last night reading some novels what does sleeping in have to do with the weather?
ifa doesn't know what's going on, so he agreed no questions asked. ororon would find the gem as soon as he opened the bag. he knows how important it is, so i knew he would make the switch.
no, thank you. i'm just wondering if you might know where the conqueror of demons is?
i'll consider coming here to relax if i have another opportunity.
i don't think we're going to get anywhere asking questions like that. let's just take a look around.
hah, the brainwashing is strong with this one.
you know, it's common courtesy to make sure the homeowner isn't in earshot when you're denigrating their abode.
honorary knight! paimon! what are you two doing here?
that's why i went into vacation mode the second i boarded the express -- thesis topics don't unearth themselves y'know.
i really wish he had a little more self-confidence.
an unexpected calamity don't you think?
it's got a small base, but it's stable enough to get the job done. i used to love stargazing with it when i was a child.
that's good to hear. otherwise, given that i am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
but i think i failed. maybe there are other things that you guys do?
yes. zhiyi's not the one i'm interested in. if he was as far as this went, i'd have handed the case off to my subordinates as soon as i realized.
okay, then i'll tell you two about how this holiday came to be
still, you needn't worry. he won't escape. you'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
(i think she's enjoying herself)
everyone that came said that you saved sumeru, and wanted me to thank you all on their behalf.
you can have it your way. take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. is that accommodating enough for you?
as a warrior yourself, i don't believe you require my help. but should you ever wish to borrow my strength, i will fight for you with everything i have. as always.
you guys have some moves. if you need my help with anything, just shout.
i prefer to make friends by sparring -- after all, combat is more sincere than words. that carefree general of the yaoqing is the same as me in that regard.
looks like our hunch was on the mora. these newcomers are very suspicious.
i saw the two inazumans leave with yanfei, heading towards liyue harbor.
good. then we'll see you both at the sabzeruz festival.
my, my! you really know what appeals to my tastes, don't you..
they are as follows: sunset vermillionite, wonder cores, and adepti sigils.
they were completely different when i first met them.
reliable as ever, miss president.
this conflict is inevitable it's destiny.
hey, not everything can be solved with food!
but you, little one. just a quick fight and this will all be over.
heh, the most famous restaurant in town. natasha would bring the kids who behaved well here for a special meal.
ah, this is great! i feel so relaxed all over, i could almost float away.
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
everyone seemed supportive, too. seems like bronya made a pretty good impression on them.
i knew you'd ask about this. go on.
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
mm, make sure you've got everything you need.
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
so, that's why gepard and i came up with this idea. we'd like you to help us find out what's going on!
thank you for the repair, xingxi. this is a great help.
about music? i'd say i'm more of a casual listener than a hardcore enthusiast.
a healer's medicine might remedy one's physical health, but sometimes the loneliness and hurt inside one's heart needs companionship and care to heal.
i did. it was a gift from sigewinne. want to give it a try? i think the color would suit you, too.
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
schubert can be quite touchy, so it may not be easy to get along with him at first.
nice, it's sweet. the sensation is not so different from eating a dessert. a unique beverage indeed.
poor little march, being bullied by a mechanical scoring system don't pay them any mind, let's go!
hesitation never did anyone any good.
i understand. the more that weighs on your mind, the more your fears become dreamscapes.
i told you, it's purely out of a spirit of competitiveness.
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
if anything else is unclear, you can ask baishi.
it's unlikely we'll be able to climb back up that far. we'll need to find another way.
don't be afraid. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall is of great help to the garden.
agh, enough apologizing. my ears can't take any more.
you'll be far more use to the city above ground than below. your job as a hunter is more important.
at the time i was in such a hurry that i didn't hear the whole mystery. i tentatively speculated that the murderer had killed the victim the night before, but hadn't locked the door from the inside.
you scratch my back, i scratch yours. it's as good as done aeur" you can just go twiddle your thumbs or something while you wait for the good news. bye for now.
on a more personal note, i am an avid supporter of all things new and innovative.
mmm, what is it then my answer is "bugs." is that right?
don't worry. price shouldn't be an issue. i'm sure we can work something out. but i'm just a little hazy on one thing aeur" did zhiyi's wineware set include wine glasses, or?
use that will of yours to reach the end of your story. that's the you i like.
it's not for you to decide whether it was a legitimate transaction or not.
you've also had conversations with the opera house's operating staff, right? didn't they want to increase the number of showings?
i want to be like her when i grow up so i can protect everyone and protect mister svarog!
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
then it seems like we've reached a consensus. i have a feeling that this will turn out to be the most mesmerizing performance of your lives.
and what did you do? you messed it up and ended up as their prisoner. i told you to make friends with a mute, not become one yourself. you really let me down.
this isn't good if what those kids said is true, then the museum thieves have operatives working in the settlement.
i won't go into details, my lady, but they've been involved in a lot of violent incidents. we're talking hundreds.
hehe, i understand how you feel! back at the grand bazaar, zubayr theater's always busy with rehearsals too.
never mind. i'll be honest with you then, i desire to spar with you.
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here mind if we ask you a few questions?
if crushing our enemies was as easy as breathing for the reignbow arbiter then what purpose did our sacrifices serve?
hmm this area is sheltered and facing the sun, plus it's flat ground, but
gamblers always place their bets on the next dice roll but the bankers always have the last laugh, and they never touch a single die.
to the xianzhou, i am but an abandoned pawn -- a wandering swordmaster. if you wish to avoid trouble, pretend we never met.
mmm you have surpassed my expectations again.
of course, sam and silver wolf would have broken us out, but bladie would've been gravely injured, and our relationship with the xianzhou would've been damaged beyond repair.
ha, you're fine! just take a breather
for a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the tenryou commission is nigh on impossible.
but in my personal life, i'm just an ordinary person aeur" someone who feels anger and sadness, just like everyone else.
yes, that was also my thought.
me neither i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
that's the wisdom of an adeptus. she takes good care of those around her. though she lives in seclusion, she also manages to bring everyone together.
but i'm still not sure which of them is our tail
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
i can't remember the last time i went for a walk like this. i never thought i'd take one through such a strange place, with someone i'd only just gotten to know.
i'll be honest, you guys are hardworking. if everyone from wildfire were as impressive as you on the battlefield, we wouldn't be so hard-pressed by svarog.
there is still much to do the people will have felt the effects of the engine of creation. there are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal
the vagrants say that the parts they worked so hard to obtain have completely vanished. they're worried that there's a thief in the camp
we will certainly strive to live up to your expectations.
that's for you to make a considered judgment on.
the situation gets more interesting with each development blitzara injured pyro-one soon after the match started, and haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
of course i missed you! the galaxy felt smaller without you in my cockpit
cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge -- that the truth will spread far and wide: to save the world, we must risk it all.
cut it out. i'm carrying out my sacred duty.
let's put that aside for a second. traveler, what brings you here? were you looking for someone?
it's gonna come down to a fight one way or another, so let's all be careful.
the president is still a hero to aurum alley -- he helped it achieve prosperity but a hero will not be embraced forever.
it's nothing as serious as that. if left unattended, the most it could do is stir up some chaos in your mind and generally worsen your mood.
traveler, if i'm guessing correctly you were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
haha, i'm not worried about that! what i meant is that we probably shouldn't go too hard on the enemy. after all, we still need to get information out of them.
that's a story for another time. nothing's more important than ensuring the safety of the countless people on this land of dreams.
sorry, i invited you thinking this was going to be a happy occasion. i didn't know that things would turn out like this
breakfast also isn't usually so lavish. hence my surprise when we got here.
progress was really slow, but they managed to hunt down some new clues.
since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy lantern rite.
your choice is noted. please keep your eyes closed until i tell you the torches have been re-lit. this battle will be in the dark.
dear, dear. other players lose their games and throw a tantrum you win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
although he's trying his best to conceal his current state, his uneven gait and the sweat dripping down his forehead make it obvious that he's been wounded and is in serious pain.
wait, don't go! take it easy, i just wanted to ask you a question
look upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. phase through that corridor, and be careful -- do not alert the meme.
after seeing you all cheering for me though, i suppose i really tried to bring my best to the game.
scrap metal, huh? the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
and, well ever since huitzilin died, i haven't wanted to form that kind of connection with people.
belobog is even smaller i can barely even see it from the express
i finally managed to get some time off work and thought i'd hop on the express for a chat with himeko. i had no idea i'd bump into you...
let's write about inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? i can help with this one. we can use the vision hunt decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
thank you, miss topaz. we're on our way to the hounds to verify some intel. perhaps you've had dealings with them?
i will, i will! haha, you're as earnest as ever.
let me answer that with a question. you claim that you were willing to pay a high price because you trusted me. but is that really the full story?
never mind. just don't look so lost when we're in class later, or you might just sleep yourself to dreamflux reef.
let's continue to keep a low profile. you can head there once you're ready.
let's say the sages didn't replace it every day. shouldn't it be hacked to pieces by now?
okay, well that's all from me. zhiyi, you'll have some preparation to do. it won't be long before you're informed of your official appointment. i hope you will work hard and make uncle tian proud.
i've gotta say, aetherium wars is really fun, i've been grinding for several days straight -- barely even had time to eat!
i didn't expect to meet you here. we were just talking about tails
but at least i have time to come visit you guys! did you miss me?
the old folks aren't very mobile, so c'mon, let's help them out. we'll get rid of the weeds first and then deliver the pickled radish.
you're right maybe we should contact miss qingque and warn her not to go to work today.
jing yuan, is it not time you sent me to the xuling?
uhh you're even asking diting?
you've already put on quite the show -- do you think you'll be able to find and operate the control panel? should be simple, right?
as you saw, qianwei is highly knowledgeable. he proposes many excellent ideas in his manifesto which effectively target the big issues.
i never thought that the underworld would sink into such ruin without the silvermane guards perhaps mother was wrong
not necessarily. if you ask me
i mean, i guess you could be trying to pursue your definition of the avant-garde if that's what you're doing, i suppose you do have to find yourselves a capable director
i'm sorry, i'm not ready to talk to anyone about the reasons behind my decision i hope you can understand.
it put me in a certain mood aeur" similar to the one i felt during my training in jueyun karst, in fact.
yeah, i guess you could say that. they've always seen us as being meaningless.
however, i've always wondered
we've looked everywhere but here i hope my memory is right.
while i was passed out, she went and caused all kinds of trouble i neglected my duty of keeping her from making a mess of things.
i brought gallagher here. it's time to face the "truth."
has it sparked an interest in the business world for you?
the kujou clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. kamaji is hardly a great heir to the kujou name, but
they are still a long way from becoming geniuses and are therefore unable to discern whether this love is one of friendship, romance, or familial love.
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze
in most matters, i would say no. but when dealing with heliobi i think the answer is quite clear.
i suppose we have let our focus drift a little but at the end of the day, you can't deny that this ocean view really is something.
ah, right! i mustn't look at you too long, or i'll be drawing more attention to our difference in status oh dear, i've already stared at you for quite a while.
my father has committed many atrocities, and deserves all the punishment that he has coming to him. i have zero sympathy for him. you may call me an ungrateful child, but my feelings will remain the same.
fangs bared, then add a little red dye the more ghastly the expression, the better! interesting, very interesting!
i should thank you for saving my life. your sword skills were impressive, taking down that big guy.
interesting. before i decide, i'd like to know what gave you this idea?
general huaiyan, the sky-faring commission has finished its preparations. do you have any other instructions?
ah, i shouldn't i have left the human world. please contact the yuehai pavilion regarding matters concerning the commercial port.
normally, any reasonable merc will know to keep their distance when they see another group's banner.
however, following this duel, i have decided to postpone the kujou clan's punishment for the time being.
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "the stone heart of a ninja is immune to pressure, immune to lies, come wind, rain, or shine."
since we're in a dream, let's make this final dance of sabzeruz as beautiful as we can!
keqing has taken an unusually keen interest in this giant stone, which is why we are leaving the matter in her capable hands.
an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
i agree with you, black swan. that's why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...
i used to have a much wider range of choices when it came to food, but now, i'm finding that simple, traditional home cooking can be quite delicious too.
their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
all of these sudden deaths and unfulfilled wishes remind us that long-life species still live out insignificant and limited lives.
for as long as i can remember, my days have been an endless cycle of studying, etiquette lessons, and training.
now then, given that your training is complete, it's time we return to mondstadt. our last step will be preparing a cordial gift to present to my uncle when you meet him.
aha--! i knew it, i always have an eye for talented people. no problem, take your time.
i know of you, traveler. you're ningguang's guests, yes? didn't expect to meet you here in the mountains.
just listen to your gut -- you were the one who said that... the remembrance doesn't lie.
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
i was the one who vouched for him, so i need to report back to the speaker's chamber. i'll accept however they choose to handle the situation.
we're cheap labor. like livestock, but easier to control nothing more.
...i ended that man's life, alone.
hehe, this is a pretty big ask~
oh? it's been a while. did pom-pom call you back?
the tuskpir is a creature that subsists on memoria. hugging it while you fall asleep can raise your sleep quality, treat insomnia, and relieve anxiety and depression.
oh aeur" and i wish you a pleasant and enjoyable irodori festival.
perhaps, but cycranes can make deliveries between delves.
if those two approve of bronya, then everyone following wildfire won't question her either.
if we landaus have one thing in common, it's that we're all stubborn in our own way.
no need. you have your own duties to take care of. i'll be fine by myself.
i don't know your background, so i can't give you free passage here. besides, yanfei doesn't seem to need your help, does she?
correct. and it's different from the underground towns you described. the fragmentum there has quite literally torn everything to pieces -- there's no sign of life, despite the monsters.
a meticulously thought out and interesting suggestion. it'll make for a novel gift. let's go with that.
if i'm putting my hopes in the wrong place, so be it. but for amphoreus, i am willing to take the chance.
there's no need to say that the beauty of music is its ability to resonate with people and stir up their imaginations.
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
i'm not there. turn back.
the shogun can't do much at the moment. come straight in and see me.
faced with a calamity of such magnitude, we have agreed to put our differences aside for now and unite against this common enemy.
well, if we can't see anything, that means we can't fight to the fullest of our abilities. should we retreat for now?
great. so, mister dvorak and i will concentrate on things here in the city to make sure the concert goes according to plan. in the meantime, ganyu will reach out to her network and try to find the person he's looking for.
if for some reason they didn't receive the letters, then please tell everyone that there will be a feast here!
do you mean ping might find the topic too distressing?
now, i want some answers. what were you planning to do with the stockpile of fireworks?
we reported it to the akademiya many times, but they never sent anyone to deal with it. we didn't want anything bad happening, so we were going to cancel all the stage performances.
once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
consuming this would be physically detrimental. remove it from my presence.
a reward won't be necessary. i'm only acting according to my way of the ninja. riches are not what i desire.
if i remember correctly, second life and wanyou boutique are old business rivals, competing for market share due to their similar wares.
be at ease, you two. make yourselves at home if you wish.
fyxestroll garden is full of abnormalities -- even the ten-lords commission cannot guarantee your safety. i suggest you leave immediately.
if you're interested, miss charlotte, i have several books on the topic that i could lend you. they could be a useful reference.
they've been up for a while already. the young guy with the dark hair left first -- he went with sampo.
hehe, no need. while what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
if kafka was holding an umbrella, that means she was in an area with artificial rainfall during the transmission.
and even ei is finally starting to come to her senses. quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
leave if you don't want to be a part of this. go tell the other two yourself oh, and take your tech with you. i don't need it.
furthermore i want to go see the place for myself. i want to know if my father is still there
asta is an outstanding manager. someone less skilled would have already let us geniuses ruin more than ten space stations.
as one of the judges from the interrogation division, i'll be recording your testimony today.
as a knight and a member of the lawrence clan, it's my duty to make sure he doesn't bring harm to others.
you're comparing apples and sunsettias there. whenever beidou returns to liyue harbor, all she brings me is a headache.
but, once the formatting is complete, pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish
uh, naeur"no, it's something very important. in fact, iaeur"i must see lady ningguang about it immediately
whoa she sounds like a big deal.
probably around three? give or take.
why of course, but now's not the time.
huh? i just think that he well, i, ah, think it might be a little early to talk about formally pressing charges
thank you, master. this is my greatest honor.
just think about it if you could combine the knowledge of every single person in sumeru, then you can basically turn sumeru city into a single, massive brain
the way i see it, "operating in secret" and "exposing the paranormal" go hand-in-hand.
alright. well, i'll leave the decision to you.
it seems we have reached an agreement. the hearing concludes here.
if someone has chosen these victims deliberately first a smuggler, then a family celebrity then this murderer's motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.
you've seen many such injuries before. if not properly treated, the man will likely fall victim to serious illness for the rest of his life.
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
hehe, i i'm afraid i can't. i won't be flying anymore.
my first ever toy was a short sword. although, i suppose it wasn't so much a toy as something master removed from her waist and handed to a noisy child in need of distraction.
normally it'll only take around forty-seven star calendar years.
you left all your subordinates back there to guard the road, making sure no one else followed you here. seems to me like you were hoping for a chance to talk.
yes, it's a possibility. that would explain why my memory of it is so blurry.
waeur"well then! if it wasn't lyney who committed the crimes, then who was it?
you've helped me so much already. how do i even begin to thank you
i'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
you see, every guest here is quite extraordinary. it's unbelievable that we got everyone to gather here almost like a fairy tale.
*sigh* another half day gone, and nothing to show for it
don't ruminate on it. take this chance to get some proper rest. the nights are long on dragonspine.
dan heng, i smell a strange scent in the air. it seems the elder is welcoming us with some hidden tricks. could you please track down the source of this scent and put it out?
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
why was this tv dumped on the side of the road?
none of the things he's doing right now make any sense if he's just trying to keep me from getting tangled up in his world
was that a message from lady bronya? hm, this theft case has been dragging on for too long -- she must have decided to intervene
do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if i have a sure loss in front of me? no -- the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
do you two want to come? it'll be a really fun time!
ahem, alright! then the matter's settled! now that everything's been taken care of, there's no reason for us to keep looking all gloomy and grumpy.
so, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? clearly, the musou no hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
this was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
don't get the wrong person, though, or all our efforts will have been for nothing.
since you're here can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
then i'd have to disagree. that's impossible.
well, that's one reason, anyway i can explain in more detail another time.
the "super electromagnetic flux player," or "electric guitar" for short.
i dunno, uncle tian, you still seem in pretty good shape to me. you might have another few years of work left in you, don't you think?
i know how you feel, clara. you want new hope for the underground, but you don't want anyone to get hurt in the process, right?
what's wrong, gepard? ahh, i see can't let go of your dear ol' sister, eh?
on any other day, i would want nothing to do with them. unfortunately though, the brigade that's stirring up trouble now is none other than dakan al-ahmar.
the first tenryou commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. that is why the title has been passed down within the kujou clan ever since.
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
my name is ruan mei. when saying my name, please don't run the syllables together.
ask, and i shall answer to the best of my ability.
after all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. it would be a pleasure to train with you.
i'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
and now, i propose a toast
i haven't fought with gepard since he enlisted. he could never beat me when we were little, but now
did he tell you that he suggested that i come work at the akademiya?
we youkai are not like humans. humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
anyways, the higher-ups didn't say anything. they just got me to come evacuate the civilians in cloudford.
the feiyun commerce guild's youngest? you must be talking about xingqiu.
it's not only the monsters that i am worried about. i'm concerned about what else might escape from the sacred sakura.
i'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. i, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. i'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
no need to beat around the bush, sir.
is this the right way? it looks like there's a roadblock up ahead.
miss march took me to her room just now. it was quite cozy. i liked it very much.
judging from the comments, there were several witnesses. sure, lady bailu runs away all the time, but disappearing into thin air?
hmm, i've been on the express for a while but i still don't have any new songwriting inspiration. how strange
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
family huh, weird.
i have observed liyue from the jade chamber for years aeur" every building and every tile is etched into my memory.
march, before the wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
i did, and that would be a good way to go about it. if they're realistic enough, animals of the same kind will follow them all the way to the trap.
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang
what are you doing here? look, if i get into trouble, it's my problem. i don't want to drag you into it.
after some back-and-forth, we confirmed that the doctor has left sumeru by boat. he has something urgent to attend to back in snezhnaya.
everything i have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
miss dunyarzad she's lying down here, isn't she? how's she doing?
exactly. see? you understand where i'm coming from.
oh, sorry, i'm doing my tour guide thing again. i'm sure someone as well-traveled as yourself has seen much fancier equipment than this.
no ritual at all. we just need to kill some time.
ahem! well, to be precise, we had dispatched two additional squads here in order to prevent the suspect from escaping.
come on. the auction is being held at yujing terrace.
not yet, everything looks normal so far. i think the problem is stemming from the energy hub.
times are changing drastically, and people must adapt. i'm not the only one committed to making a difference, elder caenis.
hah, you're absolutely right. perhaps they occasionally best the shogun's army in open battle, but when they face the raiden shogun herself
got any more encouraging words?
but of course. we also heard that master dugu is a kind and virtuous swordsman who never turns away anyone who comes with questions.
now that you mention it, gaming did seem to have a rather strange attitude towards kites.
apart from the incense that helps you sleep, there's also something i trust you will like.
don't know. my grandpa didn't know the specifics, and you've seen how wary baizhu is around me. he'd never tell me anything
with all this in mind, firefly and her companion -- there should only be one -- have entered this corridor together.
if i'm not here to help i don't know what might happen in the next wave.
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
a stroke of good luck. and a very welcome one.
how about it? can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
actually, today's a little different. i'm not here to buy anything. i wanted to ask if you could take a look at some goods for me.
you guys know ifa, right? no? well, he's a pretty famous vet around these parts. he's always bringing me all sorts of things, and he happens to be very good friends with ororon.
the astral express just received an invitation to the planet of festivities
hmm sounds like a good idea. maybe that's something i should do.
i am also one of the adepti. you can say that i'm an adeptus in training.
the vision hunt decree was obviously devised as a means of manipulating the shogun, the ones behind it knowing full well her susceptibility as a puppet with a single-minded focus on eternity.
i ran into a wizened lady there. she was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
quick as lightning, always keeping her word -- that was her way of doing things. back then i thought we'd be friends for life.
everyone's really throwing themselves into their roles. i haven't seen such a fine performance in a long time.
really? are you doing this on purpose?
had you ever stopped to consider the trouble it would bring to so many people? had you considered how many enemies you would make trying to keep the plans under wraps?
that's why the marshal decided to imprison hoolay in the luofu. it wasn't an honor but rather a warning.
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
i've begun to realize that the sages are behind everything that's happened recently. the radicals' blind belief in king deshret, making the dendro archon out to be an enemy it's all the akademiya's trickery.
it's completely blocked by the mine cart what do we do? can we blow it up?
are you bored, welt? i understand but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
shh, keep your voice down. don't let iwao and the others hear you.
the king remains still, and says nothing. the minister is the one who speaks.
the crowd never gets tired, do they?
who knows? the akasha can put knowledge into our heads, so who's to say that it can't also poke around in there? we don't know any specifics.
i would ask: would you still embark on this journey?
great, having another trick up my sleeve gives me more flexibility in rapidly changing circumstances.
unsheathing this sword without merit is to blaspheme the divine will of the reignbow arbiter, and invite calamity.
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
could we perhaps borrow that invoice? we won't have any evidence to bring against dongsheng otherwise.
let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
today was a reminder that i don't cope well in situations with lots of people. i've improved, but i still get nervous when more than a handful of people are involved.
dunyarzad's just an ordinary person. there's no way a god would be so involved in the lives of everyday people unless they were truly compassionate.
don't be melodramatic. working even a single brain cell of mine to take out foes like her is an outright waste of my smarts.
huh, chatting with you seems to have lightened my mood. it seems like talking can really raise one's spirits.
so the burden of mentoring you fell on me. it was a stressful job, and i dumped you on the train as soon as i got the chance.
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i am invited to host the public bidding of the aurum alley commercial district. with members of all parties present, the proceedings may begin.
brother and sister landau? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be
i do trust miss march seventh's taste. actually, i just tried picking out a few designs with her, but she now seems more conflicted than i am
the luofu has enjoyed centuries of stability since the end of the sedition of imbibitor lunae, much of which can be attributed to general jing yuan's masterful strategizing.
march, it's me, yunli. are you okay?
we'll also need to make some immediate adjustments to the lighting, props, and costumes.
i'll be sure that the police station prepares the appropriate compensation.
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
but as time went by, i received so many thank-you gifts and letters from people everyone was describing how they now saw me in a new light, how i'd become an inspiration to them.
grand master varka is the legend of his generation. on the day of his triumphant return, i shall be sure to personally introduce you to him. i'm sure you too will be in awe of his greatness.
deshret's relics is composed of many smaller brigades like ayn al-ahmar. the relics' headquarters issues orders to all brigades under its control.
when the adepti entrusted humans with overseeing liyue, i knew it was only a matter of time until i had to leave.
that said, i hear that yae publishing house's novels are all reviewed by miko herself.
okay, i think we have a few potential suspects.
i'm just a little confused you mentioned that the water droplet showed you how to use the projector?
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
got it! it's definitely sturdier now nice job, lynxy!
hey, seeing as there's nothing on your plate just now, wanna help me fix up this machine? just a bit of manual labor -- you might find it interesting.
i have no idea. she didn't even leave a note. i was never able to find out where she went.
but folks from the realm-keeping commission descended on the area. it's too loud over there now pass! pass!
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
it seems like i've underestimated the popularity of this game. hmm i suppose this calls for a few more volumes of "king of invokations"
you heard the call and knew that i truly did need your help, so why are you hesitating?
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
good night. garner your strength for the battles ahead.
i couldn't ask for your help and offer nothing at all in return, so this is my gift to you.
that person will then pack the caravan full of necessary goods, which will then be brought right back to dakan al-ahmar
here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
should we need to place such an order, we would certainly go to second life instead.
not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
keep your cool, second mirror. what did they say this time? play it again for me.
phew finally. i think i must have left cadet school with about the same amount
actually, after i got your invitation, i couldn't stop imagining what the express looked like on the inside. i got so excited about it that i couldn't fall asleep all night.
i deserve some answers, don't you think? tell me why you wanted to lure me here.
it would be shameful if i didn't at least recognize this much.
oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word i say.
well, we have made quite a bit of trouble for you recently. how about this? you can pick any one object here as you please, and you may take it with you.
come on, let's go to the restricted zone. if we can get ahead of the curve and find the stellaron, cocolia will be out of options.
this area is full of mountains and rivers. it's normal to not know the fastest route.
i think we can leave things there for today. once i get back, i will conduct a thorough investigation into the tenryou commission's internal issues.
uh, this is
well, would you like to participate this time? you don't have to bid, of course. just experience the atmosphere.
what are you up to? i only just convinced her everything's fine, you know
who knows? she tends to make decisions based on the results of her divinations as opposed to what others might be thinking.
if he was just looking to celebrate by himself, he wouldn't spend his meager savings on an expensive bottle of alcohol, let alone buy a pair of special wine glasses.
i don't know. before i could figure out what was going on, it spat me out
i sense it too. something seems to have changed, but i can't confirm for sure it could be difficult to verify.
hmm, i must send her a gift. it's a good thing that i know what she likes.
hm. so, a dramatic debut?
peace is the best for business. it's best to work with persuadable people. for those who are less persuadable, cooling them down with a fan works wonders.
well, where would we be without our squad leader? we had to help!
the official name is the "ten-lords commission special operations team for the heliobi containment breach incident."
as a cloud knight, i can't just sit back and do nothing when i see civil unrest. and for your information, my name isn't "little miss feisty" -- it's sushang!
jing yuan taught you how to slay abominations
hmm but you'd draw too much attention if you started speaking bananese too, dan heng.
i heard that in liyue, the biggest compliment you can pay to the chef is to leave a clean plate. it's delicious, thank you ever so much.
yes, but not entirely.
another case was where i offered distinctly more competitive terms in an investment, and this ended up arousing their suspicion.
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
by that, you mean
"the book is selling exceptionally well, traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. when is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
as a fox envoy, i have an excellent memory. i recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
someone once said to me: penacony wasn't like this a long time ago, nor should it be.
at least, that's the view i held in the past. only more recently did i start to realize that the only barriers are ones that i have erected with my imagination.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but
it's kinda hard to believe what you just told me first, let me make something clear: most of us desert-dwellers might not be the scholarly type, but we do have basic common sense
i want to take a risky job and put my body to the test again.
thank you. i don't have any further questions.
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
true. mister svarog is always there for me.
so the ei of the present planted the sacred sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the inazuma of the past
unless you want to sleep in a cardboard box, i suggest prioritizing the renovation of your bedroom first.
next time, i'll have to convince mister svarog to come along.
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back or maybe i'm just describing myself.
i took you to the "border" and let you have a look around, didn't i? but based on your reaction, it seems like you didn't find what you're looking for. it's a pity, indeed.
oh, you're right! that wasn't there when we arrived!
energy restored system online certification enabled come on, come on!
which is precisely why i've decided to revive the irodori festival by
don't worry! madam yukong is kind-hearted too. come on now, i'll lead the way.
elio can help me, if i follow his instructions.
yeah, i told the boys to gather as much information as they could. most of the reports concern violent incidents, but there's also some talk of smuggling.
yes, though it is something very precious to one of my informants. it reminds her of her mother.
a place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic so, that was the "turbulence" i was sensing.
as a fellow arbiter-general, i fully understand the difficulties of this position.
everyone, this is captain dunn, an old friend of mine. he used to be an ace on the keys in the band.
miss tingyun it's great to see you so happy but i can't help feeling a little sad.
they're not unwelcoming to outsiders, though. people travel there for business and leisure alike, and usually return with nothing but good things to say.
as i said, i need to think about inazuma's eternity. and thinking takes time.
me? none. what cocolia and the architects get up to has nothing to do with me. my time is too precious for pondering.
no murder case this time around?
are you a knight of beauty?
oh, in layman's terms, it will simulate the aeons themselves. then we can ask them questions.
here, take this letter of complaint, it's written against you. please consider carefully what to do with it, i do not wish to see another one. understood?
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
as time went on, new exhibits were continually added to the memorial until it became the museum we see today.
would you like me to slice their throats with golden threads? it would be done in a flash. all i need is your blessing, and the council will be no more.
i'll be in the crowd, cheering you on. remember to give it your all, and most importantly -- have fun!
and it'll be thrilling! bang!
that's... dan heng and the security department staff!
i do, but if i ask, then you must reply.
good question, what should we get hmm? wait a sec, why are you taking our order?
yes sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
when i brought padisarah to life just now, i was able to sense the magic flowing through the forest aeur" in the flowers and trees, and inside the creatures that live here
having someone by my side calms me -- it's always been the case thank you.
i've been great, of course. every day is a happy one.
how could he ever even dream of acting against the shogun?
correct. that medicine is a wolf in sheep's clothing -- wildfire has cut off the supply chain.
the crew members' rooms
the true "death" where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
i was born into a humble family, and all the wealth you see now began with a single haul of fish.
*sigh* i mean, you're kinda living up to the first bit right now.
this game will be over soon this time, we're going to catch her.
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all
but if you're seriously still insisting on turning a profit under these circumstances, i'm afraid you're beyond redemption.
how could someone who spent over thirty years working alongside me at the sky-faring commission turn out to be nothing more than a monster in disguise? what happened to the real tingyun?
i also pay great attention to the ways of the world just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
i told you, gepard, the barrier hasn't been fixed yet! don't try and be a hero!
i agree with your hypothesis, and just now i confirmed it myself.
i'm planning to make a new set with the board and pieces based on the battle for liyue.
once is an oversight, twice would be a grave error. i won't allow such things to happen again.
the moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. it seems that as i go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow.
i'll help you. my knowledge on the lord of the night and the wayob might come in handy.
it seems the gods have really smiled upon you, xavier and that certainly doesn't include me, mind you.
as i said, master was rather inexperienced in the ways of raising children. she believed trial and error was the best way to teach a child what they're capable of.
the "attack anything everything module"
but, most of the time, having the ability to perceive souls means watching them wither away in agony, completely powerless to stop it
even though the filming process proved to be extremely challenging, everyone provided valuable and unique contributions to the final product. thank you all for your dedication and support!
have you concluded your articulation, sir?
hmm, how much do i want? hey, how about paying me with a smile, whaddya say?
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii
that's so kind of you, huixin. you went to great lengths to organize this.
that is a pity, but we can only continue to move forward.
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
following grandpa's plan, our disciple march is taking your place as ringmaster aren't you proud of her?
mister gallagher likes to keep his softer side hidden, and even though he might seem a little disorganized at times, he's always there for his friends when it matters most.
but arlan doesn't care about getting hurt, he only cares about protecting others. it's the only way he feels... fulfilled.
everyone, i'd like to introduce you to our newest member: inayah!
to penacony's past, present, future and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound
many gods used to walk this earth, and many long wars were fought between them that did not abate until two thousand years ago. much blood was shed, and many lives were lost.
but thank you for your encouraging words. i'll do my best!
hm, let me guess fortunately, the next person you ran into was the director.
aaeur"anyway, what are we standing around here for? let's go and check on the status of the stove god statue!
then i will obediently follow you to the shackling prison and receive whatever judgment awaits me there. don't worry, i'll keep my end of the bargain.
afraid? well, you do have a different aura from other cursed swords, but you're just trying to use my curiosity to lure me in.
we all worked really hard this year. whether traveling or guiding
huh? wait, you mean the suspense thriller novel that was a number-one bestseller?
the masked fools so this really was their doing.
foreboding signs can also be superficial. you may have good fortune after riding out the storm.
so he can forget about it for now!
from now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. and after all the experience they've gained, i'm sure they are more than up to the task.
given the suddenness of the situation, and the difficulty in resolving it, i authorized a greater than normal disbursement in case of unforeseen circumstances.
oh? then what kinds of birds do you have in sumeru?
i've only been gone, what? a few months? and the space station is already in this state?
now i must take over the duties of the supreme guardian and discard my naive fantasies.
hello, sir! is there anything i can do to help you?
thank you. enjoy your time here too.
that brief window of sight that i regained has turned into a perpetual source of anguish -- forever etched into my mind
it must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
i had heard that the kujou clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the tenryou commission. the search for a successor to the role of tenryou commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency
the moment i used magic, i sensed something strange down there. i have a feeling it's connected to why the tavern had to close down.
don't mention it. you'd better get going.
so, do let me know when you have more stories to share. i'm sure the kids will love them.
fine, let's smash these metal cans first, then we can talk!
i wanted to express my gratitude for the helpful advice you provided before the match.
but it's a good thing, if you ask me, because
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
i understand thanks, master gongshu!
it would seem that there has been a misunderstanding. to be clear, the raising of both hands is not always an indication of surrender
but since you know about the stellaron and have stated that you want to help the luofu, i thought i should at least meet you in person
hmph either way, lessig is going to be in charge of making lunch for everyone today.
so, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
mm, my thoughts exactly. but we need to be discreet. if they realize we're onto them, then we will lose the element of surprise.
or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our grand master does
really? and how do i know you're not leading us straight into a trap? don't forget, you're the one with no bargaining chips.
too ordinary! hmph, such an uninspired dish will never have my approval!
i believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his nameless friends. similarly, i'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
but i digress. if the astral express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine
we were just about to discuss the boards over here. they're related to our little helpers' tasks, so i'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
hehe, don't be nervous. just follow your heart's desire.
i remember yanqing once said, "there are many ways to defeat villains, but if you want to become a true hero, you have to focus on self-improvement."
you sound very sure of yourself. looks like you've already convinced that chicken wing boy from the family.
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master"
and with that, our second round is done. cyno, layla, and kaveh are our victorious contestants!
just how much work did you do to force me onto this stage?
such is the story of the marechaussee hunters. they pursue the phantoms in the darkness and exterminate all who pose a threat
this place is practically deserted what are they doing in a place like this?
this scenario was relatively simple. in the face of a real battle, one would seldom have a chance to stop and evaluate the situation.
lord gnaeus, the calling you're heeding
i know that... i just never expected to hear you say it.
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey
i know what my friends are capable of, and they're all quite skilled. besides, i need their help.
after you left, yaoyao and shuyu tired themselves out playing with their kites.
i've hunted down hundreds of swords like this so far, and every single one of them has been melted down!
i hate to admit it, but the "harmony" in this place resonates more broadly than within the sweet dream
traveler, you are quite close to keqing, why don't you try talking to her? maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
you're going alone? that's the ipc's headquarters.
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
what's up? i'll only answer questions about the simulated universe.
if you want to give me a sword, just say the word, grandpa. no need to beat around the bush.
there is someone who can attest to my true intentions.
um this gentleman is?
miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
consider it his atonement. it's only fair that he had to do something constructive before being able to sleep soundly. seriously, don't waste your concern on him.
as for the ancient name once we handle this crisis, i'll talk to xilonen right away. don't worry aeur" i never forget a promise to a friend.
three, two, one what's the word again?
strange why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something
don't worry, i haven't forgotten my promise. but first, i have to drop by the ministry of civil affairs and close this case.
it wasn't until i held guyun in my hands that i could sense its thoughts and unspoken words.
so we've got to switch trains, right? huh? what's that?
once you're back, come find me on the railway platform. then you'll understand everything.
ah, lisa. the grand master's letter is just on the table.
you're injured. get some rest. everything else can wait.
it doesn't seem like there's any information to be gained from the area up ahead. you conclude that this area is best left unexplored at this time.
oh, him you would never guess, but he's busy over by the oven now.
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
ippei? is that someone from the tenryou commission?
so was this your choice? to respond to my request for help?
he has stepped onto the battlefield to fight a campaign that can only be won by him alone.
things may look fine only on the surface.
i can feel your obvious excitement that means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
although she ran into misfortune, it led her down a new path in life. she sees that as a blessing.
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
if you choose to play in "authentic mode," every time you elect to use a skill, you'll need to use the fateometer to see whether you succeed or fail, and face any consequences that may follow.
and so elio saw a new future possibility.
it may also be that miss firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
something has come up, and i would like to request your assistance.
"guard the border between life and death" this is wangsheng funeral parlor's most important responsibility. and i'm stricter than most
keeping such a conspicuous piece of art around wouldn't go unnoticed the thieves must have disassembled it and hidden the parts inside the robots.
its aroma is just so wonderfully delicious! if you ever see kids crowding all around mister jut's place, you'd know he's baking up a storm.
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
to be honest, i was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
suddenly you hear the sound of footsteps pierce through the darkness.
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh inconvenient situation.
as such, i have been putting eyes and ears out ever since you reached liyue
because as far as most people are concerned, mora is the key to any and all opportunities.
am i to take it that the safety of the people of inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
glad to hear it. these peace talks are quite exceptional. it is a major step forward both for watatsumi island and the shogunate.
thank you. you can also move a little to your left. the water is warmer there.
i prefer my current life. there's danger and there's excitement.
even though we believe in different gods, we can all come together as friends by playing cards at the table. we should be willing to cooperate and assist one another in the future.
but in my experience, family issues can be the toughest to resolve.
but because of my bloodline, i was always going to end up being the divine priestess sooner or later. like it or not, it's just the way it is.
i cannot. in my current state, even if i went out, i could do nothing.
he knows how to keep his identity hidden, and his sources are fast and reliable i guess he found out about mister norbert's arrest and made a run for it.
you're a smart merchant, old oti. isn't the whole purpose of this elaborate game to showcase your business acumen and seek more benefits for the family?
oh, don't worry. i've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
trying to break through would be risky. let's see if we can find another way.
there are many types of people called "heroes," and he is among the most genuine... i have seen many such people come and go.
are you sure? this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. i'd urge you not to squander it.
momentum alone will only keep you going for about three days. if you really want to stick with it, you need a solid plan.
pets like that are pretty rare, but some of the folks who have them have formed a small community to share ideas. some are interested in nurturing robots. others force them into battle.
how could a person ever be transformed into water? this is reality we're talking about here, not some magic trick!
alright, i admit that for a few seconds there, the thought may have crossed my mind.
hehe, i suppose so. once they're done writing the manuscript, i'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
do you see what i mean now? their attitude was just as i expected.
so traveler and paimon, what do you think? interested in the sabzeruz festival? will you two be coming?
i have eaten my fill. thank you for your hospitality.
if there's anyone who thinks they can be as headstrong as madam herta, i'd recommend they consider whether or not they possess her intelligence first.
alright, next you should pay my uncle a visit. he has a small camp at the top of the mountain near springvale. he usually whiles his time away there when there's nothing else to do.
i also have some ideas of my own. i'll fill you in after i've confirmed some things.
gorou, have you managed to acquire one of these weapons?
which means seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
i thought this is just the kind of thing that'd get written into your "script".
that's just the nature of the foxians. it's widely known that mystery is the key to our allure.
you knew how important that comb was to nannan, and you exploited that fact to emotionally manipulate her.
it sounds bizarre, but it could be a clue. i'll jot it down.
please follow me. she should be around here somewhere.
i understand. i'm sorry for dragging you into this mess
wait, what do you mean, "as long as i don't sleep"?
cloud knights! the borisin have arrogantly decided to challenge us on xianzhou territory! they vow that they will unleash a bloodbath along the streets of the xianzhou.
i don't think that's a monster mister svarog's database has information about it. it's called hmm, i can't remember.
we've had to fight every step of the way for this opportunity, but we now have all of the ingredients necessary to stage a truly spectacular performance:
then why exactly... do we even walk towards the light?
i imagine that an item as delicious as this dango milk must sell exceptionally well, no?
wonderful. then i'll be counting on you to provide my schedule for tomorrow.
exactly. that's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
(oh! do i smell a redemption arc?)
still doubting what your heart tells you, haniyyah?
he probably has a lot of things he wants to say, but will now perhaps never get a chance to.
the traveler is a national hero in liyue whose actions have directly contributed toward the prosperity we enjoy today.
you may have won the battle, but i shall win the war.
and those tracks and metal scratches we noticed earlier
you seem to be enjoying yourselves here.
what do you mean, "strange"? it took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
"another challenge. must deter the mortals."
i have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the tenryou commission at present. does this have anything to do with kujou kamaji?
fireworks that disappear in a flash of light are probably the furthest thing away from the eternity that our shogun desires.
lemme think to be honest, he doesn't seem very interested in the extravaganza, so he probably doesn't stick around longer than he has to.
hardships are a fact of life, both for the adepti and humans alike.
the moment he awoke, he was met with a familiar flavor in the chili-mince cornbread buns he ate
the color draws you in. you water it to see it bloom. it rewards you with its fragrance
your manifesto is very wide in its scope, but you don't seem to be personally involved in many of the specific fields. how can you be sure that you have the ability to put your plan into action?
shanghua, visit all the commerce guilds and look into qianwei's background. wenyuan, go to the ministry of civil affairs and look through mingbo's work files.
the memory zone is constantly shifting its form. looks like we'll have to think of a way to walk on the ceiling.
you are not wrong. my battle style has always been "simple and effective" -- one cut and it's over.
why don't we go check out that tavern? if the novels i've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.
that's fine. since it's something that took place in inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
but computers with too high a computing capability tend to attract computing stings like them. no one knows how these creatures evolved from their progenitor aeur" the propagation.
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
in the end, i haven't been able to guard anything. how could they have thought i was worthy to be the successor
don't worry about it too much. the more flustered you become, the less likely you are to find it.
a dreamchaser story if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
in other words this forest is a stage, and all i need to do is step out into the spotlight? hehe, sounds just like a fairytale!
if you're interested, i'd be quite happy to do a reading for you two.
manners, manners come on, you won't find another granddaughter as polite and well-behaved as me!
guys, i feel like this is just some sort of prank or a marketing stunt to boost ticket sales.
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
hello, guest from the astral express. i am yukong from the luofu's sky-faring commission. welcome to the xianzhou.
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
there's no need to blame yourself. this was cirrus's plan all along.
oh yes, please do! i'm sure ms. rekhar and miss najia would also love to have a chat with the two of you.
your appetite astounds me, but it seems you didn't eat anything that might affect your brain.
if you insist, there is one dish that perhaps you could try making for me. it's an old recipe from my grandfather's notes.
a guild that doesn't proactively help businesses has no reason to exist.
i do not have a life outside of research. people always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me.
don't worry, snowfall on this scale is no impediment. we can keep moving.
general jing yuan believes in this prophecy too, as mentioned in the report. i'm curious why you didn't question it at all?
the vagrants or, to be more accurate, the majority of people in the underworld regard robots as nothing more than tools.
no wonder aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone -- the ipc can't back him up in the dreamscape.
guuji yae, your allegation is not only dangerous but ridiculous. the tri-commission has served the shogun since ancient times and remains absolutely loyal to this day.
purified filth quickly dissipates and will be absorbed by the ley lines shortly afterwards. in other words, it cannot exist for too long.
finished exploring? i still have one last special gift for you.
you should meet the others of the genius society. some of them will trick you into thanking them after they milk you dry. at least i have my honesty going for me.
that's because the marechaussee hunters of ages past would often imbue their weapons with special enchantments to suppress the monsters. whenever a monster was nearby, their weapons would start to glow.
the port is crawling with fatui soldiers
sure, go ahead and summon the whole team, fourth mirror.
aww, you just can't bear to see me go, huh? come on then, let's go together.
tell me. aren't you and lynette actually from the house of the hearth?
the air is fresh and the environment is restful.
on top of that, in order to increase player immersion, the club has created some of the story's sets and scenes in real life. we'll only know where we should go once the script manager reveals the starting location.
yeah, i heard one male voice and one female, so it should have been the two of them. they really were just talking about brewing tea.
not that long ago but i've been receiving strict cloud knight military training since i was a child!
i think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
"perhaps her answer lies in her silence, an unspoken vow left to echo through the night. the path she walks needs no explanation."
just me? why can't we just talk here?
if i were one of the stellaron hunters, i'd be very happy to capitalize on all the chaos. it'd be harder to escape, but easier to blend in.
but upon his return, in cruel avarice, lyney desired sole credit and prepared to do away with his partner-in-crime.
it would appear so. this area of the sea is independent and does not border any country, so it certainly seems out of place here.
exactly! now do you believe that my content isn't clickbait?
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
the pastries that the zhuming is known for are mostly salty-sweet or smokey in flavor. so there's no way i can resist this kind of pure sweetness.
my brother's doing a magic show at the opera house tomorrow evening. would you like to come along? it might raise your spirits.
show yourself now, before golden thread is stained with your blood.
i get it. you don't think i have any special skills, so i'll just get in the way?
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
when there's nothing to do, we often sneak out from here and spend a few hours lazing around outside.
it's when it stops beating that we need to worry. just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
still, i'm glad you're unscathed. confronting that number of fatui at once can be dangerous.
hehe, anyway, all that aside, are you thinking about coming to our event?
i'll try my best to restore the data in the jade abacus, but it'll take some time.
congratulations, little ones. you've passed the third round of the test of courage.
are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
oh, that sounds like a good idea. if i recall, both you and sucrose are pretty good players, right?
(heh, just messing with you i'm a legendary shaman of my tribe, now that i know the cause, of course i can figure out how to fix it.)
but do you still remember? i said "i have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
i've seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. and you're no different.
i didn't plan anything. it was the future. we interfere on countless future possibilities and make the best future a reality.
oh, speaking of which, may i ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
metaphorically speaking, they are like moths to a flame but that flame is the thoughts of sentient beings.
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
from a director's point of view, i also felt like the relationship between the two musketeers in the original story could be improved.
it's fine, tribbie. as we discussed earlier, you need to prepare for the blade of fury.
you're all here on business, and it's my job to monitor the chasm. according to regulations, i should accompany you.
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously well, at least we finally get to go through
these thousands of years have naturally turned into memories of mine.
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
i haven't seen you smiling much recently. if you ask me, someone like you must look lovely when they smile.
of course not. two senior members of wildfire duking it out in the fight club? that would be bad form.
not telling yet we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
it is only upon reclaiming all coreflames that the miracle of genesis can reveal itself, granting a new lease on life to this broken world.
don't try to cause a rift between us. every move and technique i taught march is straight from the zhuming art of swordplay.
is there a room in this inn for storing books? and if there is, do any of them mention the stove god?
many people dread the sound of thunder to me, it sounds fondly familiar.
hmm can i see this pom-pom? sounds like a talking teddy bear to me.
a world that many across the universe don't even know exists
i've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
huh? could it be pascal has been repairing this abandoned town?
i imagine they don't want to leave something stolen in a place where it could be so easily found.
swords are more honest than words. it's much easier to judge a sword than to judge someone's words, so i rarely make mistakes.
forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
sure enough the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
my body has fully recovered, and the shogun's will no longer fights against me.
let's disembark here, benefactors.
i remember i used to always stay home all by myself when i was little. i didn't really have any friends in fact, i seldom spoke to anyone.
but i have experienced it all. that is why i have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
good thing we had mister farhad with us, or else that would've taken way longer.
wait, are you for real?
put it like this aeur" my grandpa makes a living telling fortunes in yilong wharf, but i'm making more than him just selling my handmade arts and crafts.
but there is no urgency. to reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land must have been real too, right?
so that's why the war has been going unusually well but risky secret weapons are not the answer. we must put a stop to it immediately.
i would've tied them up if it wouldn't have caused a scene.
i have to investigate this further. i have a feeling that whatever lies behind all this runs deep maybe so deep that no one can be allowed to know.
just some toys to amuse myself with.
yes. it is also my first time here. this may not sound fair to klee, but my primary duty is to protect everyone. finding this overlord is secondary.
thunder's roar, lightning's flash, the wind's assault, and the rain's descent all these things take place with no regard for the feelings of the common people.
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
are you done ordering? then i'll pay up.
the visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the stellaron. she knew that alisa rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it
my job is to honor my contract with rex lapis by looking out for the interests of all living things in liyue.
given the type of person she is, if she did have any clues, she would seek out our help. if she hasn't shared anything with us, it means there is only one possibility.
miss sparkle also used it to attack mister shamari.
alright, how about this we'll work with what we have. i'll give you some scenarios, and see if your work is up to my standards.
alright. i'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you knew about my greatsword. let's make this a quick trip aeur" miss dunyarzad isn't completely safe here.
i'm also hoping sakujirou won't have to use it. it's just there as a last resort.
the victor is clear. seems you require more practice.
there's nothing more to say, gepard. the decision is yours.
yeah. every transaction before the last one was marked with an exact amount of mora. but the final one, where they paid for everything to be brought back to the desert was simply marked as "delivered."
on my way back, i rescued a springvale hunter who was being attacked by a monster.
whoever this person is clearly enjoys hard liquor and has a very high status aeur" hence the need for expensive-looking wineware.
i'll see you next time -- you'll invite me back, right?
when i took this job, i had already decided that i'd quit as soon as you recovered. it's time for me to get back out there and chase that horizon.
this vein so this is what everyone is fighting over
naturally. we have long foreseen this attack and didn't intend to waste such a golden opportunity.
with me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
it's a hairpin in the style of a white heron. as well as a hair accessory, you can also use it as an ornament.
you mean cloud retainer? i saw her too. she just suddenly showed up right in the middle of the street whatever adeptal power that was, she certainly knows how to make an entrance.
if we had a little more time, i could have even convinced her i was xipe the harmony.
actually, while we're on the topic, i have an assignment i'd like to give you, namely:
haha i fear that peeking would have been a little difficult from this altitude.
now that the stellaron crisis is over, we've been able to allocate more manpower to the renovation works. the museum should be open to the public again soon.
does this mean you know them personally?
they brought this upon themselves. the xianzhou alliance forbids anyone from accessing forbidden knowledge regarding immortality.
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
this is svarog's turf. where to now?
alright. listen up, everyone.
there's a rich scent of curiosity here such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
but before i go, can i ask you a question? you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
still, your idea is very sensible. mora can only lift a weary spirit. it cannot alleviate physical fatigue.
traveler, have you decided on your wish?
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player
let's just have a casual conversation. it's easiest that way.
wait! there's something we need to ask you.
i can't just ignore what i saw. that's why i need the traveler's power. i need the power of a descender.
it's just i'm not good at this. i'm not used to being close to people.
i'd be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.
i get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying
technically speaking, he and i are under an employer-employee relationship. it didn't feel right to have my employer personally take on such trivial cases.
is it alright if i poke your forehead? just gently, i mean. i heard it helps people have good dreams.
but what i really saw was just another child, and asked all the same things everyone else did, about rugs, spices, cooking, and the differences between here and home.
toys? they're not exactly toys
everything he said is true. your family is probably unaware that you've already changed how you see things.
i'm afraid that it might've all become a mess during my absence.
calling starskiff haven. have all cloud knights be on full alert for borisin attacks!
i'm afraid i haven't had much exposure to technical fields -- perhaps she has a better theoretical understanding than myself.
and it's not that i don't understand where he's coming from. i just want him to look out for himself, too!
alhaitham probably just liked the way i worked and knew i'm good in a fight, so he suggested i find some work in the akademiya.
a lot which is why wildfire has never been able to take him down. svarog's forces are too strong. we don't have enough firepower.
erm i'm sorry, i just suddenly felt some strong emotions. let's get back to work on repairing the small robot.
that's more like it! as expected, my dazzling side comes through in any situation.
madam yukong, do you remember? perhaps that was just an ordinary flight for you. but for a certain child
lieutenant yanqing, the winner and loser of this battle have yet to be determined. don't give me that "there's no point in fighting any longer" speech!
overwhelming strength, and unquestionable authority?
in truth, all monsieur neuvillette asked me was "when did the fortress become so friendly towards the media?"
i have to thank you, mister assistant detective. but the puzzle this time is pretty strange.
you never know something very exciting might happen!
well, once a seed is planted, no matter how long it takes, it'll eventually sprout and bear fruit.
right! why waste your time?
i just hope you'll pick up some useful skills this time. oh, and stop trying to "persuade" every animal you come across
i guess the love and care for the alley brought everyone together, and that's why despite all the difficulties, things turned out for the best.
heh, i'm just pulling your leg. she let me try some of her tea already, and we had a lovely chat.
not long after i submitted my preliminary report and application, i received my punishment. it was obvious that somebody didn't want my research to continue.
if all i wanted to do was make some quick mora by exploiting their blind faith in me, i have a million more effective ways of achieving that than hosting an auction.
i guess all i can say now is thanks for agreeing to help.
i see. the spatial ninjutsu that you displayed earlier was truly ingenious. i wouldn't be surprised if you were a memo ninja from the garden of zencollection.
but of course. that's why i'm here waiting for you.
oh, also aeur" hey guys! it's been a while!
we'll see who wins next time. what do you say, miss "sole of the deep"? how about a rematch?
the remains of the swarm author?
when all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved inazuma, forever and ever. isn't that right?
*yawn* of course, the silver lining is i don't have to go on as many trips anymore.
oh please, spare me that look. i didn't sign up for any of this. i'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me
it looks like the "endgame" that general jing yuan has been trying to avoid is fast approaching. sushang, please head to the seat of divine foresight and fetch the general.
i have never missed fontaine so much in all my life.
sorry for the wait! preparations for the celebration are finally done.
anyway, we better start preparing now. first, let's see what everyone thinks about the situation.
ever since the adepti left liyue harbor in the hands of mortals, we qixing have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
let me see yeah, we can make do with this part. this little machine isn't half bad.
my clan has practiced magic for generations and has created some catalysts that only we know how to use.
i'll be out in a moment. i'm just changing.
thunder and lightning can be quite frightening, but don't worry aeur" liyue's storm and fire defenses are second to none.
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
he became a hollowed shell in his youth, and the blazing flames of vengeance were the only thing sustaining him.
condolences? well, that's unnecessary.
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
this shell hmm it doesn't appear to be the same design as this little fella's
after that well, some say the adventurers' guild has never accepted similar commissions ever since.
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too and, who is that over there?
yes. be careful, and do not act rashly.
the tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
what must have transpired to cause her such a drastic change? still, orders are orders. it's not for soldiers to question their superiors.
i disagree. you're a great secretary in your own right.
more manpower is always a good thing, since the skysplitter is so large. oh, and by the way, you should know that--
though i feel that idyia was not intentionally trying to hide anything from us, this domain does have plenty of secrets. i'm sure you've sensed that, too.
what!? don't think i won't revisit this later.
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
regarding the recent mishap i understand it negatively impacted some of our guests. as a member of the family, it's only right for me to come forward and offer my apologies to everyone.
i have to admit, he's a smart guy, and very cautious.
these tracks are superficial, but they definitely didn't occur naturally. something heavy was being dragged this way meaning, we're headed in the right direction.
miss gui has set up a social media account under the guise of investigating paranormal phenomena and unexplained mysteries we can use it to gather intel for our mission.
she also appears to be standing right behind you.
the stadium could always use more manpower, so you should join the forces here.
is this a notebook?
mines are our lifelines in the underworld. we have to keep providing geomarrow to the overworld in exchange for supplies.
aah no wonder those two ignored me.
you must have been blessed by many miracles to say that with such unwavering confidence.
even more so for mercs aeur" we're looking for our next job before we even finish our current one.
it seems we were only a moment away from catching all the treasure hoarders
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
"father" has her ways many of them are beyond our imagination, and we've never had the chance to see her at work. but we trust her conclusions.
hehe don't worry. i've already made arrangements for that. everyone will have their fill of meat. but to be clear, still no alcohol.
that smells so, so good! where is it coming from? is it coming from the kitchen on the express?
hmph, yes, that's what i would be doing aeur" if i hadn't been interrupted by a certain someone's malicious scheming.
in the name of the architects, i shall stick this spear into your nostril!
also, if we can leverage this opportunity to establish an amicable exchange with the xianzhou alliance, it may provide us with more bargaining power when dealing with the ipc.
i have my own ways. that's all you need to know.
shh listen to what the people around us are talking about. the conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will help you safely reach the floor right below this room.
(no, there should be something else that's more relevant.)
hehe, what an adorable little girl. well, that settles it. aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
there i learned to read and write from natasha. at the age of ten, i started to patrol the mines with oleg, occasionally getting into fights with the local thugs
don't worry, diviner fu seems confident about getting kafka to talk. if i were you i'd just sit back and watch her do her thing.
i will say, the train feels a little different now...
hey, you're friendly with "rain calmer," aren't you? i hear she's a tea drinker, too. why don't you treat me to some choice tea from her personal collection?
if i hear any strange new rumors after this, you will be my number one suspect.
is there anyone else following us besides you?
"father" took in lyney and me a couple months after that, but she never mentioned anything about crucabena or clervie.
her body may have perished, but she became the sacred sakura. this, too, is a form of eternity.
also, i wanted to ask you guys something. did you see a bunch of scary-looking men come by here, at all?
i understand now. you do not really distrust me, you just wish to show your rebellious side.
that sounds, uh ambitious, i guess? anyway, this is all way beyond me.
miss jade? greetings. the opening ceremony for the charmony festival has been moved to the radiant feldspar, so i'm here making some preparations.
no, please don't worry. i actually feel relaxed and even a little joyful at the moment.
hmm do we really need this one?
never. and although my mother and father passed away many years ago, both my brother and i are familiar with the vast majority of their acquaintances.
you can always rely on mister svarog to come up with a brilliant idea! so, i guess we'll have to go find a new robot shell to fix it, right?
yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. okay?
we're here at marmoreal palace, okhema's public baths. normally, this place would be much livelier.
i already picked up a few gifts earlier, so that means there's only three more left to go. but we've already lost a lot of time, so we'd better not drag our feet
let's go then. we need to find something, even if we have to search every corner of this market.
you may not be young, but your mindset is still that of a fresh-faced newbie who spends all their time on work, while proudly proclaiming to "love their job."
*sigh* i guess i don't have any special insights. i think i think we should ask the merchants what they think.
greetings, venerable adeptus. and greetings, ganyu.
and by the way, since we'll be filming "the two musketeers", we'll need to find an action choreographer ideally, a professional who has actual experience with muskets.
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides
so that's how it is i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
uh-huh anyway, what are you gonna do now, hm? hack an ipc branch nearby and get your accounts back?
i didn't talk to you on the train because i knew you and i would get to talk alone here. worth waiting for, don't you think? you seem to have a lot to ask me.
no need to apologize -- feel free to read it. if you're interested in the incomplete ones you can take it.
the sofas here all look tailor-made -- perfect for vip guests!
isn't it obvious? if we can catch one bailu, the other will come running to us!
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
with their stronghold exposed, i doubt the balladeer is stubborn enough to try and retaliate now on his colleagues' behalf. it would be more trouble than it's worth.
he's so young, but a cloud knight lieutenant already!? could he have a ma more strict than mine urging him on with swordplay?
trying to pull anything out of a sumpter beast's mouth is like playing a game of tug-of-war
it's all happened so quickly i can only make conjecture. after leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. i hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
don't be sad, mister stream! whenever i've forgotten important dance steps in the past, my friends at the grand bazaar always stick by my side to encourage me!
ah, good show today, both of you. it was so much fun to watch.
notification sent. i guess now we should go to the divination commission and see what's going on?
when windcoming day arrives, we will hold a grand toasting ceremony to welcome the anemo archon, barbatos, back home.
who is it? shop's closed today, you'll have to come back tomorrow!
but as cunning as she is, the divination commission has managed to find something.
the facilities here seem to be in pretty good shape, not like those of a place that has been abandoned for years.
the world of commerce is a battleground, and policy-making requires conviction and decisiveness.
mister sampo, take a closer look this is a wonderful smoked red herring.
while a cursed sword grants instant abilities to its wielder, it comes at a cost.
thank you, windblume star, for your sincere windblume offering to the anemo archon, barbatos. may the wind protect mondstadt.
yeah! i heard some buzz about this special partner database on the astral express.
don't worry about it, my lady. i did say that i like mora. besides, that's our next topic of conversation.
hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. this'll make excellent source material, too.
lord gnaeus, before we move on there is something we must explain to you.
technically, though the distinction is hardly relevant right now. this isn't a very formal patrol we're just chatting.
i simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. she's more fragile than i'd imagined.
thank you for the help, tighnari. make sure you rest up for now.
my pops actually received a gift from one of his old customers over there. it was from the winery or something
i wonder what's in there. here, let me open it
ah, got it. so, you're the participant attending the wardance on behalf of the yaoqing, and you were trying to sneak a peek at our training?
it is, isn't it? who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
so, you've reached an agreement? alright then, we can continue with the story.
don't worry, i had already foreseen this.
don't worry about it. like they told me after announcing my name during the curtain call aeur" everyone's work deserves recognition.
observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
records from heron express show that this container was sent by a person named "a-feng." what do you have to say about that?
there's no rush. let's see what they've got, and if you're still unsure, we can help you decide.
if we were sticklers about truth and fiction, we would've missed out on so much beauty and emotion.
as long as i can fulfill that deep-seated desire i don't care how long i live.
how about i show you around the orphanage a bit more? unlike you, my memories from when i was little are crystal clear.
there's actually more than one memokeeper who's come to penacony -- she mixed me up with someone else. but no harm, no foul
and yet -- you don't sound any different. your breaths are not prolonged, and your presence doesn't feel like it's been altered in any way
it's really nothing that exciting.
in the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the navigator mentioned we'll have to try a little harder.
oh, but yanfei, there's one thing you might need to mentally prepare yourself for.
hmm well, the origami animals in the forest only drink magic tonic what do the toy people here in constellation metropole eat?
so, i'm trapped between life and death, existing in a limbo?
a few of the wounded look up at you in shock and disbelief.
i don't know how to explain it, but all i know is that when my performance makes the audience happy, i also become very happy.
agreed. whoever it is will continue to follow us.
as you investigate the mound, you discover that the exposed portion appears to be made of wood. it was previously obscured by the large form of the monsters.
of course not. whatever it is, i'm not curious, and i'm not going to ask.
miss sigewinne was with you, and the duke has business of his own.
oh? are you putting me to the test? challenge accepted.
"moon rage" isn't so much a disease as it is my past and future. one can let go of the past, but must always face the future.
when the trace of the hunted disappears, the hunter better think twice
mister, can i please have a look at the weapon you're holding on to?
turn around and look. we can see the entire city of okhema from here.
today's little excursion caused such a ruckus that every single bodyguard at the estate was deployed. it won't be easy to hide things from your old man.
oh! my dear poet, you have my utmost gratitude for the aid you have provided us.
uh about that well i sold it 'cause i was low on mora. stuff like this happens every now and then.
my dear people. whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, i say to you aeur" keep faith in your ardor for justice!
that's more than enough. we've proven that the order is unreasonable as it currently stands.
so, we've successfully removed the doctor from the picture. also, tighnari's already resting, so he'll be okay.
fortunately, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario thanks to the help of heroic individuals such as yourselves.
just this simple chat with you has made me feel a lot better
i had nothing going on, so i decided to return to aaru village for a visit. i was actually looking forward to a pretty exciting time getting back together with everyone here
let's try to find more clues around here first.
knowing the president, i think he's now ready to entrust you with the future of the alley.
the things i've learned come from a mix of secret techniques taught by the millelith scouts, real-life cases of competition in the business world, and the experience of various overseas organizations.
of course, the one time i wish you could read my mind, it doesn't work
ah i was wondering if we might run into her
yes, alright, amber. i did my job, like i always do. i really don't see what the fuss is all about
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
and so it falls to me to place the truth before your eyes, in all its ugliness.
as you venture further into the city, the streets appear largely empty. an elderly woman walks past. you see her shake her head as she puts away her wrinkled wallet.
after the brilliant performance you put on, the reputation of your troupe is sure to spread through fontaine like wildfire. you won't have to disband if you don't want to.
yeah. there was once a time when i was an actress in a masquerade, seeking only to hide the truth
indeed, we wouldn't have found out if it weren't for mister bolai's aid.
uh since we're talking about him, i feel like i should add something. his martial prowess really looked certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
you know something, gepard? that guitar case in your hand, and my guitar they're both from the same prototype -- the "super electromagnetic flux player."
but what really interests me is that many of his views happen to coincide with uncle tian's. having someone like zhiyi take the position would certainly put uncle tian's mind at rest.
the loud noises we heard earlier were probably the result of large numbers of mechanisms we're ready and waiting for an opportunity to storm the domain.
i've left keqing in charge of the fireworks show. if you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?
i remember seeing a picture of a depth crawler in my childhood -- i insisted to my parents that we had to go and see them my parents told me how they had been extinct for thousands of years.
also, it's not all bad. i might even beat you at arm wrestling now.
the conditions here are so rudimentary. i wonder how long those people have been living here
well? the things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
the key is that the plane of euthymia represents ei's inner world. defeat her there and you may well have the chance to shake the raiden shogun's will.
mhm, i do see your point. but are you sure you wish to do this?
qianwei has many pioneering ideas, but some of his plans are lacking in detail, and he easily gets into testy exchanges with other people.
the master diviner has a harsh tone, but she speaks sense. to be completely honest, her lectures are quite memorable
should i take your words to mean that these documents were not forgeries? they were really penned by your own hand?
but when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
someone's full of energy! you don't look like a xianzh--
wait, did you say "those lads outside"? could it be
huh? ah ahem! why are you looking at me like that? is something the matter? if there's nothing urgent, then i shall be retiring for now.
i don't know whether you can tell, but the years of suffering and loneliness aren't the only reason i have a hard time facing up to who i used to be.
as you can see, after nearly one hundred days of renovation, the interior looks brand new.
cocolia let's settle this bad blood right here, right now!
is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
make sure you listen to grandpa almond, padisarah. don't go running off on your own!
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
so, it really is a baseball bat.
it's about time! didn't you say our part of the plan is the most important of all? tsk, and here you come rolling in late.
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
pascal possesses a quality that other small robots lack. it's kind of similar to the emotions we humans have.
the chrysos heirs gathered here are amphoreus's only hope. people hail us as heroes, as protectors, and as deliverers
oh no! silly me, i almost forgot something super important!
i leave the matters of the ghost-hunting squad in your hands. if you have further questions, just ask huohuo.
yes, the items seized at that time are currently stored in the warehouse next to the police station. since kaedehara has come back to inazuma, those items should be returned to their rightful owner.
based on what i have seen today, i am forced to accept that inazuma is a completely different place from the one i remember.
as long as i'm not busy, you're welcome any time!
alright then. i hope the next time we meet, you will either have already done the right thing or, will be about to make the right call.
i just thought that nothing good could come out of telling you about the messy happenings of mercenaries. knowing too much only leads to more trouble.
yeah i just think if you've got something to say, there's no point mincing your words.
i'm already set on helping you buy two new outfits. i mean, who wears the same thing at work and home, anyway?
no, no matter how i think about it, something is definitely off. grandpa didn't tell me anything about the ceremony. he must be hiding something.
even my sword feels more at home in my hand now. like an extension of my own body.
so, the children in the clinic heard the story of you and the express, and immediately insisted on sending a gift to the hero of belobog.
march, may your blade be sharp and your victory glorious.
like all the other cursed swords i'll separate it from the heliobus, then i'll melt it down and make it part of the "blade of forged remnants."
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
i'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *primal dreamscape*. how lucky.
oops, there i am rambling on again i almost forgot you're still in the middle of a tournament! good luck! i can't wait to see what you're gonna pull off next!
perhaps it's just my wishful thinking, but i think she did this deliberately, as her way of keeping our friendship eternal.
hmph, it'll take more than that. but you're not as bad as i took you for. you walk the talk.
ahem on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i would like to thank the crew of the express for saving the luofu from the stellaron crisis.
initially, my plan was to use the threat of "banishment" to test their resolve and perseverance.
continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
hm, true. let me check a few bottles.
it's normal for friends to travel home together if they run into each other on the road.
i ought to sit down and conceptualize how to incorporate and play up the way of the dazzling ninja in my narration
well, originally it was simply a place where winemakers and farmers would come to trade in raw ingredients for wine-making.
it's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. the desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
the only difference between us is whether we embrace or reject the long life placed upon us by the abundance.
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
nice idea, i think we can all commit to writing a note. we'll see what we can come up with.
you regard the stone tablet in solemn silence. the names of your comrades etched onto its surface serve as a reminder that you are never truly alone.
the one who hired you to come to penacony probably doesn't want you secretly linking up with other forces, right?
i'm heartbroken i thought it might take you a little longer than this to forget all about me?
speaking of which, i heard it's become quite common to photograph these delicacies and upload them to social media and that doing so can even earn you sample treats from different purveyors.
i don't think anyone realized, but back then we were so close we didn't even differentiate between each other's possessions. we shared pretty much everything.
you're proud to be a hunter. you're still holding on to that part of yourself, no matter how small.
one of the problems i want to solve is tackling the heating issue without exhausting geomarrow reserves. i've discussed this with serval -- she'll be the one responsible for handling this matter in future
the father of penacony, mikhail char legwork, one of the legendary nameless who laid the foundations of penacony!
to be frank, i'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural i often worry that i haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
didn't hear me, did you? with those petty tricks of yours do you actually think you can slip away right under my nose?
i'll go over the newly-arrived supplies with you later, mister snezhevich. we should be able to finish the preparatory work today.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
don't stop, don't turn back, don't look down. or up, for that matter.
what is this? what happened to the grand sage and his entourage?
this is a long shot, but it may be our last chance so, whose wish was it that summoned this device?
can i stay here a little longer, so i can get used to everything?
right. but i don't think pascal will give us a straightforward answer on this one
no, it's just this place seems familiar somehow. never mind.
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
as long as i can enjoy every day with a drink in my hand, tasty food in my stomach, and a good night's rest, that's enough. i'll only work when i have to.
fine, i guess we can swing by and play with it if it's not too far. what's our destination?
these days i just spend my time fixing things in this workshop and playing music. it's a pretty carefree existence.
people often say that a kamera's photo can never replace an artist's painting because the former has no spirit to it.
really? why do i remember everybody thinking that luck was against us and feeling like we hardly had a chance of succeeding?
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
yes. my mother and i once spent eleven long polar nights there.
what is this? a brooch?
master yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. i don't think you have very good taste.
or do you seriously think northland bank won't throw you to the wolves when push comes to shove?
in light of your contribution on this matter, i will allow you to take part in the next ludi harpastum.
but let's make a deal. how cooperative you are now decides how much immunity i give you when this gets investigated.
if breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. we've long been aware of a potential solution.
if we want to progress further north, we will need to cross that hell. are you ready?
hmph, the real competition is just getting started.
the memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. in the memory zone of penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by black swan.
thanks to them, we can finally start recruiting troops on the scale we need to openly confront the shogun's army on the front line.
although you're friends with the traveler and yanfei, i'd still suggest you heed my warning.
that's what i really meant when i said i'm no good at maintaining relationships.
as fate would have it, the girl we unwittingly rescued many years ago became the key to defeating cirrus.
later, this puppet wandered inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until the fatui took an interest in him.
hang on, i'm still struggling to understand this. i need you to explain it again
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
wow, i've never seen anything like this before! it's so much more spectacular than the little plaza in exalting sanctum.
please allow me to introduce her to you, mister alfalfa. this is miss himeko from the astral express, one of the future shareholders of penacony!
leaving already? ah, and i was looking forward to playing a few more rounds with you.
i see but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
at least give me a proper introduction! genius society number eighty-three of all my outstanding achievements, that's what you want to mention?
actions? ohhhh, i get you! another plate of delicious snacks, coming right up!
i have to agree. the tea there is very good.
don't worry about it. you should sleep for a little longer. by the time you wake up, you won't remember any of these details.
perhaps, judging from the outcome this is that person's true intention.
haha, thank you. make sure you look after me now~
there's no more hydro archon, you know and it's still a little early to celebrate.
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
concern? why would i be concerned for the safety of my arch-enemies?
oh! greetings to you too. i have a design here for a garment, would you be so kind as to take a look?
my orders are to arrest you. it is for the adjudication panel to present you with the nature and penalty of your alleged crimes.
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
i haven't had this much fun in a long time
now i understand, the ipc has many faces.
it's not your first time. i don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
tell me all about them! i'm all ears!
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
haha. the matra have all the talent they need as long as they have cyno. i prefer to be free to live however i choose.
he will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. remember, this is the price you pay.
if it is to happen sooner or later, i would rather it happen later now, let us both take a step back -- we needn't make this difficult.
fascinating. i'm learning a lot today. let's get this underway.
yeah. first time in a long time.
i mean, just as i thought, master dugu is indeed as kind and virtuous as the legends claim.
i'm heading out. i hope the next time we meet, we'll both have several more victories to our names.
and all the while, i played my part to perfection to convince them that was true
*sigh* you said you hate it when i call you "bro" in public! well i agree. it'd sound better if i started using your full name. right, broseph?
perhaps there's an issue with its language module. this little guy probably can't understand what we're saying either
no no, just giving gifts isn't sincere enough i should personally apologize to the conductor.
and just a moment ago, we caught him in a dandelion wine crate near the sailing breeze.
although this small robot appears to want to communicate, its speech is all scrambled
the restricted zone front line is on the other side of the gear bridge. it's an endless fragmentum with a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
i just told him about xbalanque's imminent return, and told him to be prepared. there was no need to mention anything else.
which is why i treasure our friendship.
if you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
hmm? what's wrong? these are the five principles for maintenance of the "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder," and i haven't even finished explaining the first one
when you order the wrong item or make too much of something, sometimes the best way to maximize the value of those goods is to give them away.
don't you worry. you still have a long journey ahead of you your story has only just begun.
i will one day die, new qixing will replace the old, and liyue will continue to prosper.
to get us started, i've proposed a crossover between the merchant guild and spices supreme -- buy a meal box and get a visiograph of bailu!
right this moment, you and i have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other's minds. this is the land of dreams's inaugural welcome for us.
it just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
can you? you're toooo kind~
talent? you'd be dead if it weren't for those two travelers. do you think stealing a starskiff and taking to the skies is a show of talent? what about being trapped by abominations?
i was lucky enough to be chosen by the alliance to come in and clean up all the old grime in the alchemy commission.
but this is sumeru city. candace and i don't have as much freedom to act here, so we're leaving this in your hands.
after ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
but after shingo dies, you'll be next.
i want to give you something more practical and realistic, something that can really help you. so, it may be different from how you imagined
ohhh no wonder he left his post for so long that day.
listen: remember what you're feeling in this moment. as long as you know in your heart where you're heading, you are guaranteed to see the ending of your story.
oh, i have some dice in my pocket. why don't we have a little fun?
count me in, too. but is there some sort of dress code or anything for the feast? can i just show up looking like this?
traveler, make sure you take a little time to enjoy yourself, too.
next is general jing yuan.
youhei, i suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. this is a life-or-death situation.
is this lady your friend too?
-- i've decided to forego my role, and never step foot on the charmony festival's stage again.
for the sake of immersion, please close your eyes, everyone. without the torches, the space is now completely dark, and you cannot see anything.
i understand, but the sound of the shutter and the camera bulb might send it into a frenzy
hmm "wander the world with them." it sounds like lady bailu would've been an ideal target -- she's always running off to play in aurum alley.
let's not forget that i am the eldest daughter of the kamisato clan. i would be very surprised indeed if anybody in the kanjou commission felt that i was accountable to them for my actions.
nameless ninjas? are you talking about the nameless? we have names, you know. i'm march seventh and he's dan heng.
my dear, why so serious? haven't you been having a great time? i have, at least.
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
and besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce inazuma to all teyvat through light novels. as they say, it's two birds with one stone.
you must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
here for a show and here for the day, but bring your wallet 'cause you get what you pay~
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
trust me. when have i ever been wrong about something like this?
not to mention that if you live in a packed and bustling city, it's much easier for people to trace your steps. this creates all kinds of issues, and gets in the way of my ability to track my targets.
i have no experience in this matter. i'm not entirely sure if i'm qualified to be a pet's "master."
we'll see. let's go back and report to uncle tian.
yes, i was going to ask you to introduce me to the adepti. i thought that it would be fitting to send them some festive gifts on behalf of the liyue qixing.
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
perhaps, there will come a day when you'll willingly share your memories with me -- i eagerly await such a time.
there was a moment when i felt the invisible thing was r--right in front of me
liyue harbor is always changing, so it is only fitting that lantern rite should change in turn.
jiangzhou was responsible for planning the lantern rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
after a strange encounter, i was fragmented into multiple "tingyuns," each embodying a different aspect of my memories.
this should be the place. let's find a spot to hide and bide our time.
as for you, traveler, you're our esteemed guest. please take the opportunity to stay in liyue harbor and enjoy the festivities.
the scars of that war never truly healed. still, the luofu traced out its arc of recovery, and continued to trade
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
traveler! ah aeur" excuse me. i should address you as honorary knight under the circumstances.
good answer! the tournament is about to begin, so i must go carry out the mission that grandpa gave me.
and look at these! how unusual they don't appear to have been left by a human
i don't have any friends that i can be frank and honest with, so maybe she's right. you're the closest thing to friends that i have.
and in fact, what meng has said is entirely plausible. spirits, on occasion, do find a way into our world.
seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist... humans traverse the path of fate.
so is that a real thing?
passing the technique on to someone means sharing your memories with them. you need to leave traces of your color in their memory, and they must do the same.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
not bad at all. i'm glad you finally got to reveal the tricks you've been keeping up your sleeve.
when i stand aboard the express, i can feel that you and i are really the same -- manifesting our own futures in this universe to the best of our abilities.
we still need to eliminate the guards as soon as possible. if we give the sages enough time to realize what's happening, the plan's doomed.
getting close means losing friend after friend for hundreds of years until the weight of their memories crushes my soul.
please, share your insights with me.
ah, the sun is out. our work's done for the day shall we take a stroll?
"come to clock studios theme park to learn more about the history of the planet of festivities!" i think the general will like this gift.
you see? brothers and sisters need to have a scrap once in a while to get back on good terms.
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
pom-pom, the conductor -- what kind of food do they like? do they like snow radish? herbs? or maybe
friends? oh, please. you guys only treat others as your bargaining chips.
alright, take him to get some rest. he's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
really, i wouldn't do anything to her.
huh? what's it got to do with anything organic? i thought mechanical parts were fine in the tournament.
hmph, i don't want people to see me that way i'm doing this for you. otherwise, i wouldn't be using my brother's name.
you seem to be interested in learning about your past life
when that happens, they will be ready to face the world head-on and become exceptional businessmen and women. but until then, i am here to protect them.
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
to the everyday citizens of mondstadt, everyone in the lawrence clan is scum. it's natural for rumors and unwarranted gossip to lead to such suspicion.
this is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: weighing your options and making a decision. there are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
haha, what can we do? the lawrence name is already a dirty word among every household in mondstadt. even three-year-olds know the story. i see this kind of attitude all the time.
keep it safe? is that all you intend to do with it?
don't mind me. just do whatever you like.
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya
talk to amber sometime. i'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
i just bumped into himeko. we got chatting, and, well i never knew she was such an expert.
in which case, i think i'll take this opportunity to show you a skill that i used to be rather proud of.
hah, did you think i would agree just like that? after our performance of "the little oceanid", i've begun to make a name for myself again, you know.
fishing isn't the half of it. you'd be amazed at some of the odd jobs i've worked in my time.
i don't need any compensation. all i'd ask in return, if you're willing, is that you tell me some more about the life and work of your late director.
ahem please allow me to explain to our host.
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
rest assured, we will come to skott's aid if needed. let's hope he's alright.
you can see guyun stone forest from here, i trust? it is no natural rock formation aeur" those are giant spears of rock, hurled by rex lapis during the war.
good luck. you'll have to tell me how everything turns out the next time we meet.
not at all. as long as you have different kinds of sauces in, you can have macaroni and tomato sauce one week, macaroni and bolognese the next
well hang onto it, it's cute.
but there are so many things i still need to do
she shuts herself off in her inner world, leaving all the affairs of the outside world to be dealt with by a puppet who has a singular focus on the pursuit of eternity
ahem! he is family, after all anyway, i will make sure to find him and escort him safely back to mondstadt.
but for now, i have to stay home with my pops, so i won't be traveling far anytime soon.
mm... i need to feel the pressure he's feeling so i can understand what it's all about.
ah, it has been some time since i've attended a festival fortunately, i brought sake with me.
hmm that wasn't quite what i'd call "by the book"
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
she's been quite ill, and her world has turned upside down. it's been so long since she's been able to see her friend that even her memory of him has become hazy
think about it, though. what's your reputation worth if you won't have the other tools you need to succeed in this line of work? tools like, i dunno your limbs, or eyes?
the view here is wonderful. it smells of the rainforest here, and we're far enough away that no one will bother us.
they respond to wishes? huh. i've never heard that one before
however, even though svarog is no longer sealing off the furnace core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
i won't force you, but people hope to regard one another with bare honesty when they enter a bath. are you willing to trust me?
tell the truth and i might go easy on you.
it would probably work on neuvillette. he has a knack for picking out who had good intentions even when the outcomes were all terrible.
elaborate a little on this "rock and a hard place" you're caught between?
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go
there's no need for that. this was merely a transaction.
although the theater's performances don't align with the akademiya's requests, the law doesn't say that zubayr theater can be demolished only because of that reason.
thanks again for your help. if you run into any snags along the way, i'll do anything in my power to support you.
we've been business partners for a long time.
ahem! you there, lowly toiler. you stand in the presence of a member of the illustrious lawrence clan. i have words for you.
no need to hurry. our deal is hardly the urgent matter here. atoning for your transgressions is the main order of business.
when that fragrant ink is burned, this is the exact odor that it leaves behind
you two are our guests, so please just relax and look forward to the celebration.
an astounding recitation of the ninja mantra, master kucha! i swear i will train hard until i become the dazzling ninja!
this theater holds a special meaning in all of our hearts aeur" it's irreplaceable.
now that you know ororon was only trying to protect another member of his tribe, could i ask you to petition the pyro archon for her forgiveness?
...but that won't come to pass. i'll do as you ask. i'll leave.
it's like weaving brocade -- you and i can only add one gold thread each time, but eventually, we will make a gorgeous pattern.
what you said back there did you really mean it?
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
there's no mistaking it this component was taken from gears and wisdom!
when i was little, he told me that if there was anyone in the world who knew the answer, it would be the reignbow arbiter.
but with your level of ability, i'm sure it was a walk in the park.
to claim that i "made" her do anything would be imprecise. we reached a mutually beneficial agreement, as is always the case in our dealings.
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
sure. thankfully, i'm off the clock right now.
so, what do you think your odds are, march?
i heard that you broke one of the ten-lords commission's sacred instruments, and almost--
some of the gods got drunk. one started playing music and the greater lord started singing, so the goddess of flowers began to dance.
huh, this space is completely empty
correct. although it possessed shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. as a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train shingo to become bolder.
that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name
i honestly never thought that all of us would end up here
i would be grateful if you could inform the shopkeeper about this. i should return to the station and see how things are going.
you astral express trailblazers have outstanding manners, though your allegories are a little odd
oh? but that might take some time. besides, we're not here to get to know each other as family.
of course i remember him aeur" the young master of the feiyun commerce guild. i have dealings with his family all the time. who knows maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too.
the carving? you mean the one i gave you?
oh, must be the key to the big door
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
it's true that i've witnessed thousands of years of liyue harbor's history. all the changes it's gone through, the stories of its people
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
everyone has different dreams. if we accept miss topaz's offer, then doesn't that mean our dreams will never come true?
it's a new game script by the tabletop troupe, a local roleplay adventure club.
look -- "exalting sanctum" -- this is a safe place. let's just walk the rest of the way from here.
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
yes, though we don't have any clues to go on we should sweep the area again soon. but first, let's focus our attention on the problem at hand.
look at it whenever you're feeling down. who knows, maybe it'll raise your spirits. if nothing else, you'll know that i'm supporting you all the way.
this again don't tell me, it's gotta be
might i remind you that i am not here to amuse myself.
i vote monsters. that's the main duty of the hunters, right? we can come back to the sorcerer later.
their imitation of long-life species has crossed the line.
if it was the growth serum, cappet would've been turned into a giant.
the marechaussee hunter before you appears to suffer a serious mental breakdown. he needs to leave the room for a moment to collect himself.
she is the one that's been causing our forces so much trouble. the fact the resistance has even held out for this long is thanks to her.
denied. use of force has been forbidden.
not only that, putting spices supreme on the map would increase interest in the alley as a whole.
but how dare you bring your petty disputes into the safe haven of aaru village?
listen, i know you academic types love to fill up your big brains with self-righteous morality, and lord your empty rules and virtues over each other
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market
but, when we were preparing for the debate, i heard something quite wise. maybe it'll help you.
whoa, whoa, hold your horses. chief oleg wanted us to come and cheer for you, he didn't say anything about becoming your sparring partners.
is this the lesson you learned from your journey in liyue?
the robots will have seized the road ahead by now. we should go carefully.
if it looks like a hot pot, smells like a hot pot, and acts like a hot pot i can only diagnose him as being a hot pot.
you guessed it! everyone agrees that there is no better candidate than you.
will you stand with me by the window a little while? no need to talk
i know. but since we were looking for food, i figured we might as well try to fix the stove.
hehe it's mainly sour with just a tinge of sweetness, and a lingering aftertaste.
i've decided to forge an exclusive mask for you!
patience, phainon. do not make us question this decision.
i tried to visit her, but i got turned away at the door the people there wouldn't listen to a single word i said.
our paradise is none of your concern, masked fool. leave now, or the family won't tolerate you anymore.
we are entrusted by the people to loyally see out their wishes. wangsheng funeral parlor is special, in that it carries a dual responsibility, to those both of this realm, and the next.
what i'd like to know is pom-pom a rabbit that learned to speak? or a person that was turned into a rabbit?
if it's two, four, or six, then i'll be the one who has to reveal an important secret to you. what do you say?
but to me, they're so much more than that.
did welt learn how to play celestial jade in the end? if he hasn't got the hang of it yet, tell him to come see me and i'll show him the ropes.
i--it's nothing. you're right, it does belong to me.
as for cocolia, the best side of her will live on in people's memory. that's not all bad
when i run, time seems to flow especially slowly. being able to think at a leisurely pace is quite nice for someone with my impatience.
i know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
yes, that sums it up very well. most people looking to buy my time are businesspeople who believe that whatever they spend now, they will make back several times over in due course.
here we are. according to the judge, this area is not yet under control, so we should proceed cautiously.
also, why use a spirit-duffer in that case? you're basically setting yourself up for failure.
haha, the little babies from the luofu just don't have the resilience that us kids from the zhuming have!
typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
in return, i give you a blessing from me: good luck. i'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.
but as a warrior, i look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
so, what did they want out of it?
it's fine. those of us here are all trustworthy, so there isn't any harm in it.
warriors of the past who spilled your blood on this land, your noble souls now rest in this earth.
i was looking around before you got here i already looked everywhere, but march seventh is nowhere to be found.
so, have you thought up what you'd like to say, boss?
such a direct act of provocation is enough to get my competitive side worked up too.
from the back, it looks like a ledger. but it seems they also use it as a site log.
my mother mentioned in her notebook that tsubaki enjoys food from all over the world.
by the way, dunyarzad, we've already started decorating the grand bazaar. it looks spectacular, thanks to your generous contribution!
when everyone's rested and ready, let's go through the leads. time to find another heliobus.
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
looks like i did get you all wrong. you're not a feeble scholar, but a sinister and despicable one.
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
and with that, marcel's motive has now been established
the rain... is intensifying. before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions.
every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
i've been on my feet all day. i don't have the energy for more headaches right now. let me catch my breath and i'll come find you tomorrow.
writing a manifesto takes time, so i informed them of this requirement in advance. these are the reports they submitted.
i have worked in every post in the sky-faring commission from maintenance to pilot, combat reserves to stargazer such a long time has gone by so quickly.
i'm sorry for what happened... i was too focused on that girl, and got sloppy...
is this something tail would do?
thank you all, thank you so much!
as the marshal's special envoy, i'll dispatch the luofu cloud knights to pursue hoolay myself.
jing yuan you haven't changed at all -- always trying to destroy the plans of others
hmph, looks like your mighty architects weren't as all-knowing as you thought.
that said, since i'm free to come and go as i please here, it would be a terrible waste for me to not use it as a backup base.
i'll take this weapon since it used to belong to este. maybe it'll find comfort in being held by someone who appreciates the arts.
in all the time since i took him in, this has never happened.
or how about this aeur" i'll invest in you early on, before you make it big.
who cares? we'll round up all of 'em.
no, not at all. the purpose of the trip is to relax, after all. simply do as you please.
changing our content would not only mean turning our backs on our vision, it would also directly lead to the loss of our livelihoods.
was this an accidental achievement on your part? or have you studied the art of war in great depth?
there's no other grand theater in the dreamscape.
in this iteration, the game master's version of the script is incomplete. the script manager provides the next part of the script only after players have completed the current list of objectives.
sounds amazing. it's a shame i'm too busy to attend but even if i could, i'd probably just scare people off with my current appearance.
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
wait you're not asking what the theater does, but what it is.
thank goodness you take the time to perfect these inventions, master! if not, the sky-faring commission would've become quite redundant by now.
huh who's wilder? and what's "aetherium wars"?
officially, the assessment is already over, and i'll be expected to announce the results before long. so we have to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can.
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza
are you all there? here, like last time, repeat after meaeur"
thoughts from the experts? are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
being the master deceiver she was, the weasel easily earned cesar's trust. now all that remained was to frame him for her countless crimes.
this atmosphere really feels strange are you sure topaz is here?
two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span in and of itself, that's very unusual.
the artisanship commission is full of workshops, buildings, state-of-the-art mechanisms, and craftsmen designing brand-new concepts.
or perhaps the ley lines did not have the power to sustain him for very long. as was the case with the memory we saw earlier.
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
huh? so that's why nothing's going back to normal! c'mon, we need to hurry.
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool and it seems like a stunt they'd pull
opportunities like this don't come around often. just look at the guests on this ship. they're surely holding a wealth of valuable treasures.
this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
i don't quite understand what happened there, but congratulations, i think?
i felt very sheepish, having had a change of heart after flatly refusing you. and then, to make matters worse, you caught me
are you dealing with attacks like this every day?
if there's nothing else i can do for the both of you, i'll be on my way.
some people here say they saw him. guess he stood out as an older guy heading into the desert alone, with just a sumpter beast in tow, and very few supplies
did you travel here alone?
i've only ever seen this quality in mister svarog
so, this nahida you mentioned what did she say?
need something else? isn't the seat of divine foresight anxious to learn about the prescription?
i i was just ever so slightly concerned about the situation you mentioned. yes. a teensy bit concerned, that's all.
may the wind guide us in saving dvalin.
eh, might as well then, i suppose. actually, do you have a towel? i would like to dry my hair.
if you wish to truly achieve the dignified conduct of an aristocrat, you must learn to remain composed and elegant even amidst harsh conditions.
even though it ended up causing everyone a whole lot of trouble, thankfully, everything worked out in the end.
traveler, let's go find verr goldet.
hmm not bad. sounds like something one of those old bands would play at the beginning of their sets
not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the penacony grand theater has now moved to the radiant feldspar -- the very airship you all stand upon.
please let me activate the mechanism before we all move forward, and please watch your steps.
this is an opportunity for you to show remorse.
that you have piqued her interest. perhaps it's because she has never seen an individual who is so unpredictable in the face of eternity.
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
both of you may continue to stay in okhema, and its citizens will continue to view you as distinguished guests. however, you must promise that today's farce will not occur again.
i see it seems like you have made up your mind.
it's arlan's shoe size alright -- and this actually came from a pair of shoes i bought for him.
maybe i'll see you the next time danger beckons. until then, keep your wits about you a lot of people are watching you for a lot of reasons.
watatsumi island's people yearn for peace because they have long since given all they had to the war effort. they are tired of treading water, and don't need you dragging them back underneath once again.
you didn't actually have to come to mt. tianheng. go back to liyue harbor, find a guide at the yuehai pavilion, and
there we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
everyone has different personalities, so there are some small squabbles here and there
let's go get ourselves some answers.
i didn't intend to keep his sword. i was planning to take this chance to return it to him, but now i've changed my mind.
starting from mondstadt, to liyue, and then to inazuma i will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
seeing you cooped up in that library all the time, i was worried you might be bored. so i thought i'd give you an opportunity to truly make use of your talents.
just open your eyes! surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? we've had nothing but critical acclaim!
according to the lord of the night, the ruler of death is one of the shining shades, an extremely elusive figure. even woven scrolls dating back thousands of years have nearly no mentions of her.
yeah, sure. why should i object? not only this sample, but all the goods on the transport ship are yours to keep. like i said, we won't inspect them.
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself
none. no one has seen the devotee of eternity since she shut herself away. in fact, no one even knows what it looks like in there.
in the first stage, candidates are required to submit a manifesto for liyue's development. in the second stage, we will ask them some questions in person.
i was very interested in the express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where i left them. now i can't remember anything about it.
"the xianzhou luofu cordially invites jarilo-vi's warriors to join the wardance."
ah, you're back. from the sound of your stride, i sense you're in good spirits.
besides, there's no need to be nervous. this project is destined for success, i feel quite optimistic about it.
but the fireworks
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
i would ask -- would you still embark on this journey?
right. i'll leave the research to you then, lisa.
i hesitate to call it a solution, but i might have some information that might help.
i had no idea you knew how to bake i thought you'd be the type who'd never get anywhere near the kitchen.
sure, there were clashes and distrust, but virtually everyone was acting in the best interest of the alley. if that hadn't been the case, the whole thing would have fallen apart.
anyway, beidou is currently in the guyun stone forest area.
don't worry judge huohuo. effective communication with the public is one of the basic skills of a cloud knight~
your opponent this time is similar to the ipc mechs. unsheathe your swords and give it everything you've got!
the answer is simple: it's because the assistant detective is the murderer.
have you all considered this? perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned akivili never reached
yeah, but have you heard the tale of the first sage? to prevent a calamity, he went on a journey to find the dendro archon.
if you're trying to accommodate me, there must be some misunderstanding. i'm fine. there's nothing embarrassing about running into colleagues in the wild.
aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. but this galaxy ranger we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
of course! we always do lots of eating, toasting, and gift-exchanging. we try really hard to show our appreciation for everyone.
watatsumi island observes different customs than the rest of inazuma. i imagine it must all seem a little alien to you?
understood. keep monitoring. keep me informed should anything come up at the institute.
do you feel any closer to becoming the great hero you've always dreamed of?
it was simply a new experience for me. one that is worth reliving.
no. she was not created to ever be turned off.
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
if fate allows and you're interested, upon our next meeting, we could journey to no man's land and traverse its tranquil glaciers
i'm not entirely sure what it all means. maybe mister gallagher can shed some light on it?
most people only pay attention to your tail, but those soft, pointy ears are really just as fascinating.
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
are you serious? that's big news. how come i never heard about it?
work? as long as lisa's there, i'm not worried. she's more hardworking than anyone once she gets going.
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
in all likelihood, he's just an opportunistic merchant. nothing quite as scandalous as matsuda and uchimura had imagined.
rather than worrying about them, we should worry about my brother first.
seeing you again is a change to eternity and a very nice surprise.
sounds like there really was something on her mind.
rest in the grasp of its people or yours, elder caenis?
yeah surely we've earned it?
yeah, i don't think it was stolen on a whim.
come on, asta has been worried about all of you.
so the key is whether or not you yourself can develop a sense of belonging in liyue harbor.
don't move. i've seen eremites get struck by lightning before. you need to rest.
the third child of the landau family, right? i've heard gepard mention her before, but i've yet to meet her. from what i've heard, "lynxy" -- as they call her -- is very smart for her age.
you need to choose your words carefully if you want to persuade him of something. it might be best if i talk to him though i'd need a strategy first.
then for now i will excuse myself. qingni's irresponsible actions caused much trouble for the two of you -- allow me to apologize once again on her behalf.
uh, we're still lacking a pillow in here. although someone who can sleep comfortably on a cardboard box probably doesn't need one
we're almost there everyone, stay close.
yaeur"yeah everyone has their own way with words, and it's really hard to say no
i've heard that many places in the galaxy that partnered with the ipc have become popular areas for interstellar trade.
i don't want that to happen. if you guys really believe that you can convince mister svarog then i need to be brave too.
how fascinating you must be full of secrets. there's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
no sweat. this is your first time in belobog -- i just want you to feel some of the warmth the city has to offer.
i heard a lot of heliobi were sealed in the artisanship commission's creation furnace, but they all escaped when the furnace broke that's why my workload is the way it is
of five people, three must pay a price.
his wife, lying next to him, said: "you're off to search for the dendro archon today, aren't you? have a safe journey, my love."
why'd you come find me out of the blue? miss me?
look how smashed up this ceiling tile is... arlan must have bottled up his frustration and had no way of releasing it -- so he took it out on the monsters!
you see these people? they're all miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like hair accessories or brooches?
are you guys ready? i'm going to play it.
but when it comes down to it, whatever differences there may be between the various games around, they all share one important thing in common: they bring friends together.
"to the honorable and trustworthy marechaussee hunters: our kingdom is currently facing a grave crisis."
so much for your memory. did you forget the architects expelled me ages ago?
...mister yang, before answering that question, i wish to continue the previous topic.
you apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the gash, and carefully redress the wound. the man regards you first with bewilderment and then with guilt.
i agree that art should be enlightening, but we can't pursue that goal by creating complicated works.
ten years of being sealed away has sapped the underworld's vitality. now that the furnace core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
if others were to find out i agreed to work with you so easily, then, well
is he your leader? i feel he possesses a great stillness of mind in everything he does.
here, look someone deliberately scratched off the paintwork -- didn't even do a good job of it.
relax, i'm confident now. i don't even need to do the deep breathing exercises after all, we've already known each other for a long time now.
leave it here, and i shall sample it.
i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
also, those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the invaders seven hundred years ago
darn, i wanted to see one
i've been monitoring the dark web -- i barely managed to stop the video from spreading. the incident hasn't grown any bigger -- for now. how are things with you?
you're right. i've probably been idle for too long -- it's easy to get stuck in your own head.
of course, you'll still need to take the keys and pay a personal visit to the two hunters you wronged. prepare to accept any terms they give you as well.
look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
besides, if we fail to uncover what's really going on in this tournament, we simply leave haniyyah to her own devices who knows what chaos might ensue.
she told me that you salvaged the forgotten hall's memories with great skill, that you are a rare talent.
greetings. i'm acheron.
ah, yes: "true love cannot be controlled by external forces" little layla's belief is a classic one.
welcome back. i appreciate your help more than i can express -- it couldn't have been easy running all over the city.
there are many kinds of smiles, but only a truly joyous one can bring blessings to others. let's consider this smile a down payment for our future victory.
but before that, on the road towards the end, there are still many things that we can do.
not a chance! curiosity can be perilous, you know. don't forget my warning, the less you know, the better.
it sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. but it won't end there. they are not the type to forgive and forget.
greetings, friends. it's been a while.
you have a clever tongue. i like it.
i cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
now that you know what to do, why not give it a go? i'll be right here, waiting for you.
according to grandpa's plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if there've been any new developments
they don't seem to care much about "death"... instead, they're more concerned about the charmony festival and the watchmaker.
a great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the yae publishing house's ace in the hole. and i would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
now that these guys have finally shown up, it's a huge weight off my mind. bring it on, you abominations!
i feel like i'm dreaming.
the desert's a tough adversary, but at least it doesn't hide anything. what you see is what you get, and whether you take on the challenge is entirely up to you.
come on. enough procrastinating. let's go.
i'm going to count down from ten. if you do not come out, i will destroy the ship.
hah, that guy. one of these days he's gonna get busted by my brother.
let's go report to natasha in boulder town, it won't take long to get back.
the tenryou commission has a responsibility to ensure public order and security during the irodori festival. if anything comes up, come to me.
you mean leave the plane of euthymia?
say what's on your mind, and do what you think should be done. if we fail after that, then at least we won't have any regrets.
what about you? are you feeling alright?
so many buttons how many centuries would it take to press them all?
hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
the dendro archon smiled. the next second, the sage found himself lying in his bed, as if he had just woken up from a dream.
with your swordplay skills, you can effortlessly take down ipc mechs, march.
you're right. i "took" it with my skills, so i guess you can say i'm a robber or something. how dare he imply i'm a thief. totally different!
but, given that the array gets its power from the ley lines, she suspects that the obfuscation requirement may be a rule laid down by the mountains and the land.
therefore, i took advantage of the situation and changed the threat from "banishment" to "execution," to see if the two could remain firm under the most extreme pressure.
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
when i first got to the space station, the researchers had prepared a room for me. i--i was really grateful, but it was far away from everyone else. that was a bit disheartening.
just look at this flying sword. even if i give it back to you now, it'll just be taken away again in a few hours.
as i passed by the palais mermonia, i heard that neuvillette was investigating a case with you.
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
well, well, someone's feeling pretty confident
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
glad to meet you, too. are you here to participate in the wardance?
after a moment, he lowers his hands and stands back up. his gaze shifts to fixate on your group, but he does not move from his place at the king's side.
yes. for a chef as accomplished as yourself, getting to the finals should be a breeze.
hmph, listen to her. "what is the meaning of this?" she still thinks she's an overworld princess.
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
for long-life species, such events are more like yesterday's memories than ancient history. this awful spectacle is child's play in comparison.
perhaps it's because i'm the electro archon's familiar.
when you came to talk with me earlier, i jumped right to explaining my position, and said some strongly worded things.
where am i going to find another genius as mentally well-adjusted as me? in the mirror?
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
hah, takes a special kind of person to get cyno chasing them all the way to caravan ribat.
you will miss much by refusing progress you seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
you know, i'm serious about this. what if you guys run into something that you can't handle? i'll be your nifty on-call assistant!
at that time, i could sense ei's whereabouts, but i also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
the light here why is it still on? this place has clearly been abandoned for a long time
i'm not talking about the puppet. i mean her. you've met her, yes?
yes. any recommendations?
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
hmph, well i'm gonna make sure i don't owe the guards any favors when this is done!
by the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
i suppose you heard? you're this year's windblume star. you will be making an offering of windblumes to the anemo archon, barbatos, on behalf of the whole of mondstadt.
like i told you. that guy barely leaves his nest -- it's rare to see him away from the furnace core. even when he does appear, he doesn't stick around for long. he leaves everything to his subordinates.
relax. when the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
perhaps your skills have regressed due to lack of use, but, soon, the unpleasant smell of something burnt fills the air.
it was because of both of you that qingni escaped unscathed. words cannot express my gratitude.
oh, nothing. it's just you don't see things like this every day.
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
speaking of champions -- have you heard the story of the mysterious "elite player?"
yeah, just leave them to candace. don't worry, she's as tough as they come.
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
despite this, they were all willing to pay very dearly for them. i wonder is faith in me really the only factor in their appraisal of the items' value?
no general can win all battles i have to admit, that was an excellent show of skill.
you could capitalize on the rave reviews and license out "the little oceanid" to the bigger theater troupes out there. that would do wonders for your financial situation.
the only reliable speculation is that it favors those caught in dire circumstances and bestows miracles upon them.
i'm not too sure about rahman's whereabouts. my guess is that he's with dehya.
you speak too highly of us, welt. the stellaron hunters are merely destiny's slaves.
you two, this way. i'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
there was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than yae miko, the wise and beautiful.
i can also smell a mix of elements in the air. pyro, electro and some other elements as well.
miss samuel, i think you'd best turn around. it seems you're not quite familiar with the term "pawn."
hold on, the quality of this space this isn't reality. it's a realm of memory!
(a pawnshop that grants wishes is there really a place like that on this ship?)
that's right. my people are busy collecting clues now. what's the situation, moze?
yes. at most, these items are only worth a couple of thousand mora.
don't be afraid, i've dealt with those robots before. let's go!
oh? well if you're quite sure, then of course. now, i shall send you on your way.
well, back in the day, the first thing he did with any mora was spend it on things like drinks and meat.
that's it~! first you arrive out of the blue, then the general recruits you to the cause -- it's like the stories where imperial heroes bring salvation to the world.
i'm just here to try something new. there's no fun in reading the same kind of thing over and over again. relax, it's just words on a page, isn't it? what could i misunderstand, really?
"dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." who knows, the wind might take it all the way to celestia.
i also have you to thank. the things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
don't worry, huitzilin's technique hasn't been lost at all. come with me, i'll explain everything at my house.
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
only to mom. you know i still don't get along with dad.
when i asked for your names, i couldn't help but think that this "first encounter" was actually a "long-awaited reunion" for you.
then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began five hundred years ago.
it doesn't? looks like miss sparkle is more careful than i thought.
oh? what are you trying to say?
firstly, your trial of the heart! you went to professor capote and asked him to simulate conversations with you so you could better understand your boss.
so, two chrysos heirs are willing to vouch for you. hah it seems my actions were too high-handed.
the deadline is looming i'm counting on you.
that's the belief of the architects but for us, hell is an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
once we reach the gate, i hope you'll help me seal it. after that, i'll do everything i can to fight the borisin, and you find a safe place to hide and wait for reinforcements.
but with the arrival of the stellaron, things have become messy. some delves even had their entrance marked as the exit.
you mean here? uh, i can't think of anything in particular
your eyes are working just fine aeur" yes, i have two tails. you wanna pet them?
besides, we're here to procure information, aren't we?
i've brought all the lighter gifts with me, but the silks are still on the way. i just submitted them for delivery, so i'm sure they'll arrive in good time.
your words alone will not suffice. ninja initiate merchant, is this truly your intention?
you guys you're not cloud knights acting as borisin, are you?
this norbert guy, do you know what his line of work was?
and if i end up having to do it all over again in the future i will not hesitate to make the same decision again.
i doubt i know much more than you, but i believe that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances is very powerful.
uh-huh, that's my pops! he's a good person, alright. everyone around here respects him.
but what if the bigger war comes to pass? what then?
since you asked one of the three questions, it means everything is going smoothly. are you ready to hear my answer?
and you didn't hear anything else at all? nothing that might leave an impression of any kind?
however there's a problem that needs to be resolved before it can open to the public.
you two have heard of port ormos, haven't ya? it's the largest commercial port in all of sumeru. you can travel there by leaving sumeru city and heading south along the river.
wow, this would be the perfect location for shooting a film.
you probably think i'm being impulsive and unreasonable, right?
right. especially with someone outside of the shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
it's hard to find the music you want on the streaming platforms managed by the ipc. i, for one, had to subscribe to at least a dozen of them.
hmm, i guess you're right maybe it isn't such a big deal.
calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to what again?
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes truly are sorrowful.
even though i lacked the talent to pilot the starskiff and wasn't much of a warrior, i still chose to travel around with the merchant guild.
so, honorary knight, what is your choice?
i'm sure you've become acquainted with the general background of the moonchase festival. however, i have my own understanding of this festival's roots.
i, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. approved.
so they were the ones that corrupted and tampered with the settings of my puppets?
rough patch that's a mild way to put it.
uh what's going on?
oh no, not yet! there's more mora to be made.
oh, and the perfume sold around here is a lot better than what you'll find elsewhere. the fragrances are longer-lasting, and they're gentler on your skin
that healer seems to be a senior colleague of sushang's but i heard that he's even more energetic than she is! maybe everyone from the yaoqing is that way?
klee ran off excitedly as soon as we arrived. i'm a little worried about her, but albedo insisted he would look after her while we do our own thing.
is this what it means to reminisce?
for the sake of the vision hunt decree, of course. don't you think the shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
let's focus on the business at hand. that miner we met said his brother came this way -- we should look around.
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
my grandfather was a researcher of liyue's traditions. in his notes, he indicated that there was a deity called the stove god in ancient liyue which people paid tribute to at a certain time of the year.
aristocratic etiquette is all just for show just smile and nod along! i was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even i don't take them that seriously.
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
uh, no, not at all. this place just gets me thinking, that's all.
mister oswell? i thought you headed back home with mom. how come?
none. the ruin was completely impenetrable. the only way they could have gotten through the solid rock would've been by blowing it open with a special kind of explosive.
the manifestation of the prophecy must have seen this. it saw lord phainon's heart wavering.
my master and general jing yuan have an unpleasant history with each other. but personal grudges are a luxury that adults cannot afford!
if one carries a blade, it's bound to be used to cut something down. my reason for drawing my sword -- past, present, or future -- remains singular.
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
come on, march! let's go find him!
you flatter me, lady yuheng! my family are but distant relatives. we would hardly consider ourselves the true heirs to that illustrious lineage.
be at ease, i'm not here to see commissioner kamisato. actually, i'd prefer to spend this time chatting with the traveler. please, fetch the tea set at your convenience.
but when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
the university plans to hold an academic conference on the topic of "trailblazing" in the moment of sol. the astral express has been invited as guests to the conference.
please can you explain to us again the details of the case?
the express has faced all kinds of obstacles on its journey -- today is just another one. it's no reason to stop trailblazing.
are you suggesting that there are people trying to understand hoolay's secrets and use them for their own purposes, just like with this mech?
hehe, giving a dramatic speech to my boss was cool and everything, but it's not gonna help her break free from the heliobus clouding her mind.
ahem! we've been eating the same rations for the entire trip, so i simply thought it was high time we had ourselves a proper meal. do you have a problem with that?
as she danced upon the grass, countless beautiful padisarahs began to bloom wherever she stepped.
anyway. now that i have been defeated by you and your plan, i will honor your wish to abolish the vision hunt decree.
what's happening? is the girl in trouble?
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
shouldn't we ring the harmonic chime and see if we can talk to yanqing inside the illusion?
you intend to travel all over teyvat, and the time has come for the inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
it was the last time i spoke to caiyi.
there's much you don't know about the space station, and even more about herta.
as the one who shook eternity, you are her potential for change.
thaeur"this doesn't look weird, does it?
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
one of them was perfect for stargazing.
eversummer was that always the name? seems i was too young to get the irony back then.
i doubt he came here to learn. he's much too old to start getting a basic education now, and from what i know of him, i doubt he has any interest in intellectual pursuits.
she's a big shot from the sky-faring commission who can't rest even after retiring from the front lines. it's hard being a powerful official.
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
but no matter how gepard and i asked and probed, lynx simply refused to tell us who she was gonna meet *sigh* i'm such a failure of a sister.
tea parties are a must for the well-mannered. if you'd like to learn the proper etiquette, i'd be happy to teach you.
so alice went to all these lengths because she was too busy to be with klee?
you don't understand. the one preventing us from getting close to the truth is cocolia herself.
no. someone i've never met before. today's lunch will be our first time meeting each other.
state your query. to the point.
haha, quit worrying sushang, you've been an awesome squad member! and a very talented sleepyhead.
i see so you noticed something was up with the akademiya from the very beginning.
make any funny moves, and i'll smash that scrap metal.
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
as a doctor, i don't accept that -- i'm responsible for their well-being. my attitude towards this "wonder medicine" won't change.
i hope everything's going well for you. don't be like me, worrying all the time
or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what i wanted to do.
but don't think we'll just hand over the mastery mark without a fight -- you'd better make sure you're ready before you even think about challenging us!
i was scared of someone recognizing me for who i truly was, and exposing the secret i swore to protect.
do you remember how you got here? or what happened to your body just now?
give you a chance, huh? sounds to me like you'd rather strike some kind of a deal than spend lantern rite behind bars?
please don't misunderstand. when you helped okhema, you already showed ample goodwill. it's just that i
otherwise, i may not be able to hold back mister zubayr this time.
i like to keep my scythe sharp so i can get a good night's sleep on it.
no, only a handful. after all, i prefer warm memories baked in sunshine. they're the ones that usually belong to kind people.
...when i saw this photo, when i saw you fighting alone just now...
yeah, it's a favorite in her tribe. i bet she still hasn't realized the feast is already over
anyway, even if you don't find tail, you're still a great judge -- the success of our ghost-hunting squad proves it.
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
descendant of the kujou clan. regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the kujou name.
everyone, get ready. this could be a tough battle.
sorry to ask you like this after having just met, but your answer is very important to us.
he didn't? that doesn't sound like the divine foresight i know.
seriously, do you actually know anything about swordplay or what?
how about we check out spina di rosula's ship? we should have a view of the whole of poisson from there.
hehe, please just disregard my presence. now, tell us what you discussed.
you played the hand you were dealt masterfully. commendable.
it's a very cute room, miss march just like you.
i'm in today. but that is not an excuse for misbehavior.
something i never have the opportunity to do
it's just as they say: each swordsman has their own unique style, and even the same swordsman can't make the same cut twice. it would be impossible to copy these marks.
so you believe that this universe is free?
to be honest, i'm not really cut out to be a leader. at first, my dream was to read up on military strategy and perhaps become an adviser.
*sigh*, i'm not sure you guys will agree, but
aaaand in addition to the coupons, you can get a visiograph of bailu, our alley ambassador!
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
the ocean really is beautiful at night
h--hey! i'm not always like this! it's all because of that cursed sword
let's leave it there for today then. i'm sure we'll find out what else mister narrator has planned for us tomorrow.
speaking of which, mister zhongli, the fireworks show will be particularly exciting this year. please, don't miss it.
as such, it is my privilege to work with you on this exciting project.
once you're reflected in my mirrors
didn't you say that the villager got his news from the tavern? well, i also like to drink at the tavern, so i know a thing or two about these radicals he mentioned.
looks like you've been keeping an eye on the skysplitter. have you noticed anything unusual?
i didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
it's like like a fight between two friends. if they don't agree to see each other and talk in person, isn't it possible that the friendship could end entirely?
actually, some of the cloud knights use pellets which contain trace amounts of this ingredient. when you block pain on the battlefield, you have a better chance of beating your opponent and surviving.
do you mean you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
it's too late for nerves now. it's almost time!
a certain celestial jade-playing divination commission employee, perhaps?
we were just talking about her, as it happens. little layla told me that haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. but after you met layla, she very abruptly left.
i suggest that you make some concessions to appease the merchants. if you don't follow mingxi's plans for the dock, she will temporarily take over your position.
i was due a visit, so i thought i'd bring you a gift. nothing too precious, just my way of saying thank you!
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute
i heard about the holy lyre, but i never suspected it was you.
a meticulously choreographed "chance meeting" sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
hmm, alright. we dare not refuse such generosity.
for me, the truth or lack thereof is not what matters in this game
i wrote to my mom about the recent monster-slaying and demon-fighting stuff i've been doing for the ten-lords commission.
she wanted me to stand next to her, but i'm glad i stuck to my guns. besides, i'm not sure i could handle that many people staring at me.
i'm sorry it took so long for me to find it. only by bringing it to you will my nightmares be calmed.
this lady is really something else!
just stop whining. at least you're in one piece, right?
still, the outcome is uncertain. shouting loud doesn't necessarily carry any weight. what about the phone call i asked you to make, topaz?
i'm very upset he didn't obey my orders and insisted on searching the storage zone even though everyone had already evacuated.
adepti sigils serve as a means of integrating the mechanical devices with adepti art. they are as indispensable as the mechanical core itself.
himeko and mister yang and who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
belobog's history and culture museum was founded six hundred years ago, and was originally built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa
that was the gaming association -- turns out they're making me stick to the rules.
elio said that you would help me. i wonder how many possibilities he saw before he got a glimpse of that reality
ah, should we get ready then? perhaps we should wear something a little more appropriate
i wanted to come here to perform for cocolia. to say goodbye
besides, i'm the one who should be apologizing -- i've put my own personal reasons ahead of belobog's reconstruction
the city is still shrouded in a gloomy, oppressive atmosphere, but your spirits are surprisingly high.
memory is like the deep blue sea. but if you try to catch two fish with one cast you might not be satisfied with your catch.
mm-hmm. as long as you can keep up.
now, i'll press the advantage.
but amber said the snowman i made was too artistic apparently, the conventional style is more rotund in appearance.
hmm, i dunno depends what's in it for me
no, no, only an extra couple of hours~
from your description, i suspect you were dealing with a "devorator."
this assertive aggression silvergun shura's words, before they were sealed, must have been just as fierce as yours.
hey, lynxy! come and have a look at this!
the end of the story needs to focus back on aurelie herself. she's the true star of the show.
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
you don't need to thank us. you bear a heavy responsibility.
hmph there's no way back anyway. at least cocolia won't catch us off guard now. so what if it's an ambush!? we're not about to lose now!
it would seem we've cleared every abomination from the area. let's find another location and continue our contest.
as i am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. that is the nature of liyue.
of course, that can't be undone now. it's too late, and i have no intention of reinventing myself all over again.
this is a deserted island, so explosions shouldn't trouble anyone it's just a bit of relaxation, right?
there are three thermic cores -- you'll need them to solve the puzzles in the victory zone. let's see what you've got!
if we were to create a trap now, how would you design it?
but even the gods of other lands, hehehe
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
yeah, but i still hope that things can change. it never hurts to have hope.
let me say it again: the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
same as usual. my schedule normally isn't too packed, so i have plenty of time for myself.
"be eager to help those in need and do one good deed a day" i like to practice what i preach, but i never thought we'd accomplish so much.
i've yet to experience it myself, but no one in their right mind would turn down a chance to journey through space.
now place your left hand onto the bench. lift your arm up with your palm facing forward, and part your fingers slightly
yeah! he gets my vote too, being my ancestor and everything. oh, and also the silver swallow!
the solution is right in your hand.
in all of belobog, you won't find anyone who speaks more elegantly or acts more like a leader than lady bronya.
ninja initiate gigaku, deliver your final line.
bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. you should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.
i promised to help you and i'll keep my word. nothing to worry about.
who's there? didn't your parents tell you to knock before--
if it came to it, i could always destroy another jade chamber.
hehe. well, if you were just looking to shoot the breeze with me, i can get on board with that, too.
the cloud knights are here -- i need you to help me get rid of them.
but it happens. battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. it doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
there was a beautiful dancer, and from the moment i saw her, i couldn't look away.
the intel suggests that the fatui saw him as very low risk, but zhiyi was still extremely careful with the poisoning.
long story short, regardless of why the xianzhou alliance invited us, joining this wardance is of august meaning to belobog.
which means it's you, mister sampo. i've been using this term of address -- but it was you who first came up with it.
sometimes i just put on a wig, change my makeup, and slip on a pair of glasses - just like that, i can go anywhere without a worry~
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
what were you looking at so intently just now? let me see.
it's only natural to want to escape when strict rules are being forced on you. i know there are a lot of grown-ups trying to control you -- telling you what you can and can't do they're the ones to blame.
knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. i should be thanking him.
to be honest, i feel the same way.
for now, all we can share with you is that your friend cyno is working with us.
i've been hoping to raise all this at the peace talks and discuss it properly. grievances have to be let go eventually
it also wasn't spinning at the right speed. before the incident, it spun much faster than that.
if only i had talked to you from the beginning, grandpa maybe things wouldn't have escalated like this.
wait, wait, wait madam faruzan's right, that style is a classic, and used to be mainstream fashion. but these days, there are some other options, too.
i feel like i'm lying down on the back of a massive anemo slime. ahh, it's so light and comfy~
food like ramen and hotpot tend to have a lot of oil and salt, so i don't get to eat them very often.
you'd better be careful. don't get too close to blitzara when you're knee-deep in the water, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a very unique lower-leg massage.
you're definitely a unique individual, just like huaiyan said.
everything you said earlier sounded like the truth. luckily, your monologue was dramatic enough to convince my friends you were just roleplaying.
really? i find that hard to believe
wait, what do you mean, "either"?
so, i only hope that justice will be served in this matter. don't overthink it i'll go find someone to arrange the meeting
some time later, as a member of the marechaussee hunters, you receive a commission. following the address provided on the message, you take a boat and arrive at this strange city.
so you mean to say your father intended to die in the duelists' ring?
huh it's just, there are less painkillers than i'd expected. did someone break into the storage room?
he shakes his head and continues to regard you with skepticism. in the end, he decides to inform you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
so, the intruders and hoolay are holding the yaoqing messengers hostage.
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
the intelligentsia guild is always able to find a way to support their case, writing enough "scholarship" in one night to fill a library this is a problem.
that's enough! you've screamed and shouted at each other for long enough. now pipe down, both of you!
i happen to have some time at the moment and came to take a look. i sometimes have my clothes custom-made at this boutique, in any case, so we always have a lot to talk about.
the next item has to do with the movement of people and military authority.
this power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
before i joined the stellaron hunters, the nature of my work meant that i barely ever saw the same person twice.
this looks like a mine.
that sounds like both buttons can do the exact same thing?
so enjoy your life while you can, and when your duty to the living is over, you can meet whoever you want again in the afterlife. isn't that great?
yeah, and that's why i love it here.
once we've returned the goods, we'll find the owner of the house, and you can apologize to them in person. after that, i'll escort you to the ministry of civil affairs.
naturally. i've dealt with similar issues hundreds of times. give me a moment to consider the best approach in this scenario
i heard that you've encountered some problems, and came to see if i could be of some help.
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
creatures like you don't understand humans.
i think i understand what kouzen means when he says it's too late.
i should have gotten involved earlier, but i was tied up with other responsibilities. my apologies for letting you take on the investigation without proper support.
still, i bet there's still a chance for kids like hook and clara, right? who knows, maybe they'll be able to represent belobog as it returns to the arms of the universe!
i was there many times when i was supervising the festival construction, but i haven't been there since.
well, this seems like a good moment for a break. take some time, and discuss what you want to do. let me know when you've made your decision.
besides, you guys need someone familiar with the divination commission to show you the way, right? then let's go.
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
yo, why the exhaustion? you look like the officers over at the realm-keeping commission.
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
just as you start to make way to the square, intent on finding the man again, there's a voice
actually, i don't think i agree. master diviner, let's reset the sandbox and give it another go, shall we?
because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
there are no permanent allies or everlasting enemies. so, let's both take what we need from this deal.
gui, nai, fen! "gui" means fine wood, "nai" means to exist, and "fen" means fragrant -- rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?
if i were you, mister president, i would think of ways to translate the success of that one sample into something that can benefit everyone.
i cannot stress enough how important it is to not let it escape.
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces let's hurry back.
oh, i could hear you. i just have a habit of being silent while i'm watching fireworks.
i've been in liyue harbor for quite a long time now, and i've witnessed many farewells along the way. so i, too, am well acquainted with the pain of the passing of a loved one.
i'm sorry dunn time for a little nap.
it can get uncomfortable, i guess but what else would i be using my voice for?
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
besides, i'm a researcher how could i not get excited about the chance to explore new worlds up close? everyone gets tired of living in small places like belobog after a few years, right?
then let's go. we can find somewhere to sit down and talk. food and drinks are on me.
always thrilled to hear you're in good health. but i was really asking about your emotions. have you managed to calm down?
the qualities you've mentioned are very likely the reasons mydeimos refused this coreflame.
hmm some of these are true junk, but there are a few items of value here.
you two are welcome here anytime! seeing you safe and sound in between adventures will keep me from worrying too much about you.
the people we met along the way are probably workers from the toytanium mines, or guards who came here to claim the dragon's head durin probably allowed them to live here because there was nowhere else for them to go
before you came, i already had a look around i know it wasn't appropriate, but i just couldn't help myself.
hehe, i hope i'll actually be able to get some sleep over the next two nights.
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
you saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. after leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
it looks like i wasn't supposed to be privy to the contents of this particular meeting. this simplifies things.
hold on, any minute now.
mister svarog, let's get started
look, a solitary chain. go say hello to it.
it was after the components landed where they did that their owners and the things associated with them arose around them to form the different zones.
where did those things come from? corrupted data? reanimated systemic rust? no, not likely it can't be the legion's second ambush, right?
say, caiyi i really didn't think you'd come back do you really like flying starskiffs that much?
huh, i just found this in my pocket how did it get there?
just pop a thermic core into a lamp, and all the nearby lamps will light up simultaneously -- cool, right?
oh, as for you the chief will decide your fate when we see him.
anyway, i actually came over to let everyone know that we're all done for today. you can go home and get some rest!
i'll be fine. we also have the support of the warriors stationed at the various outposts. given the quick response, things shouldn't get too serious.
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath "exchange with your precious things."
the memories i have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
but now that the islands of narukami and watatsumi are on amiable terms, we're all friends.
it all comes down to being an experienced warrior.
i wouldn't be where i am now. i wouldn't have known that they respond to wishes, and i wouldn't have seen all these beautiful sights in sumeru.
delivering a high volume of packages isn't a problem for me, youkai's legs are naturally fast after all.
mingbo is reliable, but not quite ambitious enough, and because of his personality, he struggles to win people over.
as your friend, may i ask how the alliance intends to punish the general of the luofu?
um, won't we stick out if we go in like this?
he must have encountered some kind of danger and his sword flew away to find someone to help, right?
it's not like that! she just has many responsibilities to bear. i don't completely understand, i trust that she's trying to solve the problem.
i'm well aware. but don't you see? zhiyi is gambling everything on this. if we really want to catch him, we're going to have to accept a little risk ourselves.
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
you gave your medal to that kid eric. this thing might not be as valuable, but it's at least a replacement of sorts.
pascal, we've got mister svarog to help treat your illness. he'll help you recover.
you sure know a lot, mister luocha.
i appreciate the sentiment, doctor baizhu. i'm just doing my job.
i wasn't expecting to receive vip shrine visitors during down time. hehe, so i suppose you're here just to visit me?
no, seriously, it does though. in fact, it's how i used to find my tortoise whenever he went missing.
this is the residual memory from when the 'invitation' was first delivered they were abruptly interrupted. then, what happened next is
march is right, grandpa. i heard the escaped prisoner from the shackling prison is beyond formidable. in case anything goes wrong
y'know i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request
anyway, looks like we're done with business here. traveler, lend me a hand. let's tie 'em up and bring 'em to the village.
luocha already saw the control panel -- why is it taking this long to find it
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
after we split up, ayato went to see iudex neuvillette at the palais mermonia.
the embodiment of strife telling me about the majesty of the world? what an irony
you should stay here, little layla. i understand that you want to help haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. leave it to them this time.
my real name is guinevere. guinaifen is the xianzhou name shangshang gave me. who is shangshang you ask? she's my best friend -- sushang the cloud knight. have you met her?
the same can be said for all of us.
pela's got a lot on her plate -- plus she also does volunteer work on the weekends sometimes. that's why we usually schedule mechanical fever's rehearsals at night.
why don't the both of you tour our "holy city"? see how our people make ends meet in this difficult time. i will have your welcome gifts ready later today.
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
however, for some reason, pascal keeps getting attacked by his fellow robots, because the automatons think he's a fragmentum creature.
in bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. also, sales for the book would only increase further.
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear
i just have one question. even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
my lady, stop trying to look tough. we're already in a tavern, so let's rest up and grab some grub.
alright then, how about you? you've already resumed work as the general mahamatra, right?
it's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that i'm used to.
wildfire i don't know anything about them. in all my time above ground, i never heard of this organization.
i'm qingque, a diviner from the divination commission. you wanna play celestial jade? okay, come back during my work hours.
what are you all huddled together over here for? the adeptus left already.
anyway, the next part's the records of the goods themselves. there are a lot of entries everything was probably sourced from the rainforest.
wakening which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
well, the qimen arts teach that the state of the ley lines is intricately linked to human activity. each can affect the other.
unfortunately, ganyu is on leave at the moment, so i'm unable to get in touch with her.
i'm concerned my stress may even be starting to somehow affect you as well
exactly right. please consider your choice carefully. remember, you are representing the whole of mondstadt.
you're thinking that there's not a huge difference between me turning these children into my informants and the actions of those two businessmen. am i right?
i knew there was a workshop in this town, so i wanted to try my luck here. i found all the components i need, but then i ran into a monster
i'd rather not play around. we don't have very much time.
when i found myself bored with little to do, i would skim through the various books we had lying around the house.
oh, that shouldn't be a problem. when we get back to the tournament venue, i'll ask a member of the genius invokation tcg society to provide one for you.
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination
what about me? oh, i'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels
my guess is that it's because we had communications with many worlds before the eternal freeze. luka, have you heard of the story of igor haft?
wow, that's pretty great! i wish the photographers at my shows had your skills!
if anyone happens to find a potential exit, please be sure to take every precaution before exploring further.
it's my sister. looks like her soul hasn't returned to the hall of karma yet.
oh, remember that big one that went up first? the gold one?
that's alright. take your time to contemplate this moment. once you feel ready, let's step onto the final stage.
all of it exists within the border between the living and the dead, an ordinary place, really. the only special thing about it is that nobody really knows about it.
well, if that day comes
i've heard a lot of nice things about the lesser lord from dunyarzad. i can understand her devotion and gratitude.
but what if they and we aren't really that special?
besides, being a leader is hard. it wasn't the right job for me.
mmm what's this little device here for? could you please let me know? it looks like a little button.
mengming, the owner of the sleepless earl, went to great efforts to set up her shop, all so that workers like us can catch a break and find some joy in our lives!
that way i won't have to hide behind mister svarog anymore.
even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. amazing
the moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of eternity. i shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
exactly. we'll only be able to help them once we've seen our own mission through.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
hee-hee, i've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want. we will likely meet again.
i didn't do much, just helped you leave the memory zone.
don't give me that! i checked the records here. you didn't take any cases.
at ease, wraith warden. these two are not your enemies.
well, the paths here serve as both passageways for the ten-lords commission and barriers for the prisoners.
sticky honey roast that's your favorite, isn't it, amber?
i'm sorry, my lady, but this is just the kind of man he was. he probably saw this box as some kind of personal trash heap, and dumped any and everything in here
was there anything particularly memorable?
the fatui are a problem not only for the knights aeur" they also present a real threat to the whole of mondstadt.
i'm sure he didn't get lost. even i was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
the man we ran into he doesn't seem happy at all.
my brother often hummed a lullaby to help me fall asleep when i was young. that was the first piece of music i learned even without lyrics, it's still the melody i hold dearest.
from what you were saying a moment ago, it sounds like you know a way out of here?
yep, you got it. i've heard that you've already crossed paths with ayn al-ahmar? they're one of the groups under the relics' banner.
the sofa is so soft
geez, and there i was pouring my heart out now i feel like this kid's lived longer than i have
that's a shipwright's soldering gun, i think one of the workers here must have left it behind.
and anyway, to your point about collaboration you've been helping out too, right?
ohhh, i've met them, alright. one time, i wore a weeping mask and snuck into their troupe.
don't worry. even without their intel, i've already detected hidden currents within the city. a trivial issue, nothing i can't handle on my own.
pascal's trail leads in that direction. let's follow it.
hmm choose your words wisely, geppie
is there someone here in rivet town doing this? or could pascal have collected the pages and put them together?
i clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of mondstadt
even though it may not allow us to make the most of the surroundings my apologies.
sounds good. remember to always watch where you're going, and don't rush.
could it be some competitors working on other films?
good idea, why don't you take a look around, benefactors? my feet need a rest.
but i've made up my mind. so i will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
you really don't have to. i'd like to hang out on my own. bye!
regardless, whether the reason behind the present threat is clear or not, i'll handle the situation.
i made a clone, but it doesn't hold a candle to the emanator.
if you're all out of options, please get in touch with me. i'm the kind of person who values friendship highly.
shouldn't you gather people's opinions first?
far as i know, the kind of incense you just mentioned is only popular beyond the wall.
this whole time, you have been a great companion to me. you are always so considerate of my circumstances.
the prophecy of deliverance is nothing if not ambiguous. it urges us to defy the gods yet refrains from providing a clear glimpse of what lies ahead.
where are you going? please take me with you~
what if huohuo came across a lead today -- something that sounded like tail's doing? knowing her, she's probably gone looking for him
now then, my good, noble chief justice, should we not, in your view moveaeur"
however, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well
if it's that mysterious could you let me take a look, so i can better understand its mysteriousness?
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
it seems more than a little reckless to charge in when we don't know what's ahead of us.
morning this is early for me, but you seem pretty peppy.
at some point, a rumor began to go around that there is great treasure buried beneath qingxu pool.
in any case the sight of mora has always had a way of improving my mood, no matter what the sum is.
your recent feats have been doing the rounds, you know. in my brigade alone, a lot of people have been talking about the things you've achieved. i've even had several people ask me if i can introduce them to you.
the phenomenon hasn't reached a lethal stage just yet, otherwise, we would have starved to death without eating for so long.
you'll be able to try all the finest food for free. how does that sound?
north as far north as we can go.
oh, that reminds me that last person will not escape my vengeance either
ah, but back to your question i really like the way you've decorated this place. it's so snug and cozy.
"i bestow upon you the blessings of the forest, and offer you a home in this land"
however, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? did something manage to sneak in?
looks like she also sent you a message
ugh, the culprit is still hiding in the shadows. can't we find even one lead?
mm, we should be going to see wildfire. let's move.
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
i've seen too many people lose their senses on account of things like this. if you want to calm them down, you need to convince them with something tangible.
good roll alright, maybe i'll take one more day off, and knock out the rest of the work once i'm feeling up to it.
though that was their name, they did not hunt animals, but rather various monsters left behind by the ancient dynasty of king remus.
he was the one who proposed doing this aeur" he even wants to assist in our magic shows.
the person you're talking about -- are they in charge of the people in black?
even though i may fail, i'll do my very best for everyone's sake!
you remember rivet town? when the fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. we didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
so you are the only one here? hm i thought i might get to meet your grand strategist.
i called for the gag order and for the exuvia to be hidden to temporarily stabilize the situation, and also to prevent something similar to the incident in mondstadt.
well, the situation here is pretty similar to when you first arrived. it's just that instead of a few thugs and broken robots, now we're dealing with much more formidable adversaries.
sorry, i got a bit distracted there.
good evening. have you had dinner? what did you have, how was it? oh just making conversation. don't think anything of it.
since she's not here i guess the next step is to check all the other adepti abodes, one by one.
i'd like to transplant some padisarahs.
i can sympathize with your unhappiness at home, but after you ran away, you ended up at the theater and became one of us.
"i disagree with your point of view" that's what i would say if we were still in the plane of euthymia.
ah, i must say, i would relish the opportunity to watch the fatui getting a taste of their own medicine
well, at least we know what we're looking for now. we just need to keep going. that said the metropole is huge, where do we even start?
i've said my piece now. even though it'll be tough for grandpa i still have to melt down the sword.
don't worry. the shogun's not broken, i've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
scared? no, i just don't want to see her disappointed.
please excuse us, benefactors. i look forward to our meeting.
the tides come and go, but the ancient sea remains the same. for us vidyadhara, there's nothing more nostalgic than our homeland.
it's been more than two hundred years i never thought i'd hear that name again.
of course. my word is my bond. i said that i'd stand with you to the end, and i won't go back on that promise.
what are you, a mob boss?
remember my adoptive parents i mentioned to you a while ago?
you are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity
since i'm a genuine knight of favonius, i fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. look, i may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but i'm not a total degenerate!
time is running out. we need to hurry.
there should be a dedicated evacuation team waiting for us. you can go with them.
to be honest, i've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.
spending time with herta, screwllum, and stephen is enough to wear one out.
hiding the exuvia was a necessary maneuver to take the initiative back, to play the spider while our foes scurry about.
hehe. you are the most important part of the plan. i know what i'm doing. you don't think i'd leave you with no chance to win at all, do you?
now, let's proceed upward!
given the present circumstances, the cloud knight garrison probably isn't a safe destination, wouldn't you say?
foolish question. there are only two kinds of foods aeur" those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.
okay, you won. go on, you can put on that smug face now.
and there he goes again i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
and obviously i played my part, too.
do you two still remember what it was like when you first saw me?
calorie surplus detected digestion mode engaged.
it is also very quiet. i think i will be able to concentrate and get a lot of work done here.
would you be willing to help the tenryou commission one final time?
when ayato approached me about holding the test of courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help chizuru face her problem.
you really don't think we have a chance at winning the debate?
but for the knights of favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
maybe we can discuss the tales of legendary heroes. have you heard the story of the heroic king of khaenri'ah?
in the end, the first sage took care of many disasters in sumeru city and founded the akademiya. what a happy ending!
hah the scenery out here is fine indeed, but the wind is a little strong. our preparations to receive guests within are complete aeur" so please, this way.
he's been raising phlogiston aphids for a long time, and since they were disturbed, they secreted a special type of phlogiston. we can use that substance to track his movements.
yes, the story is the reason i agreed to join. i can't bear to even imagine what this film would look like without the very best director.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express
a ninja's super hearing can capture even the death of a proton. you spoke loudly before me. i wasn't eavesdropping.
do we have an agreement? well then. no backing out now.
i must be prepared for anything. if there are more formidable monsters lying in wait in this area, i must make sure i have the strength to face them.
if you wanted to refuse, then why would you be standing here right now?
today, at long last, you and inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
at last, i have found you, you who returned from jueyun karst.
ah that shadow looks a lot like my hand.
i understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. however, before that, it's essential to know that...
we don't have any convenient pills like that, but if you just need a temporary boost for the duel, we might be able to figure something out.
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
here. take this. it's powdered rime aeur" just add it to your snowman, and it will never melt.
despite all the hardships elder huaiyan has faced, he still finds joy in the world. he is an example every general should follow.
why? because the whole of liyue witnessed me destroying my jade chamber.
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now
the feeling of creating your wealth with your own two hands is just as exhilarating as ever.
a long time ago, there used to be a group of bandits in the liyue countryside who would sound a horn every time they were about to raid a village.
no loss can ever be undone, but there is always much that can still be gained.
no need. i asked for you to come, so i won't send you away empty-handed.
belobog apologies, i'm not familiar with the name. regardless, welcome to the luofu. mister luka, are you here for a consultation?
huh! what you're saying is quite different from what her dual swords have been saying to me.
um i don't remember if my parents ever sang any lullabies to me.
just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend -- people of all kinds that carried the will of the aeons.
really? feels like you're tricking me
my meeting with ninja initiate gigaku was purely happenstance, but i did not come here alone. these nameless ninjas are also my companions.
hmm, i wouldn't want ordinary folks to become superstitious the less they know, the better.
i have my ways. i would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
exactly. the evidence will soon be blown away by the wind, so it's nothing we can arrest anyone with.
bailu told me you two heard me yelling before you showed up. is that true?
thank you. i hope there are new discoveries to be made each time i visit.
only some who have gone under their shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more nihility... that's all.
so it's the power of the aeon? i see
oh? i didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. you wouldn't mind it if i took a soak for a while, would you?
we should be nearly at the bottom now let's wrap this up.
oh, really? so that's how you see me?
what does it matter? don't worry about it, it's all part of the fun.
as you can imagine, the conclusions that the evidence points to are not mutually exclusive. which means this is probably another prank from miss sparkle.
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
i wouldn't be so quick to push aside the need for redemption.
i'll say it again. i don't care what ruan mei said to you, but there's no chance we're shutting down the simulated universe!
which means that you, svarog -- uh you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld for the time being.
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
but once in a while, it's nice to treat yourself in the company of family.
i think so too. the composition needs a little jazzing up.
y'know we're pretty good at turning a happy reunion into a tear fest. let's call it a day and give them some room.
please accept our humble gifts, i hope you'll find them to your liking.
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
but you've been really looking forward to this. i don't want you to have any regrets
this is an automated area, so don't you think that there are a bit too many people here today?
ah looks like the next part of our script is here.
plus there's the fact that all this praise of zhiyi has only been happening within the last two or three months.
just like the master diviner -- no matter what cruel and horrible paths she foresaw, as long as it benefited the luofu, she had to make a choice.
i assume you need me to teach you the conduct of the lawrence clan. only then will you finally be able to communicate with my uncle, correct?
should be all clear now. let's poke around.
when you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret
clearly, professor capote is unlikely to master my speech or mannerisms any time soon... but the content is the key here!
i quote: "sixty miles to the northwest is the guili assembly. many were settled there, where they hunted in groups, farmed the land, and made their living from what the soil yielded."
nice! you guys are pretty handy -- you picked that up in no time. wanna be my assistants? average pay, but i'm a good boss.
even for someone with illuminated beast blood in their veins, working for such an extended period without a break will take its toll on your health.
yes where you dealt my forces quite the devastating blow
stay close, no going off on your own. the desert doesn't take prisoners.
i took a closer look, and the craftsmanship doesn't appear to resemble anything from this era. if i remember correctly, that style was last in vogue several hundred years ago.
ah, paimon and the traveler. i've been waiting for you.
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
belobog's future is not for sale, and we'll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need -- not once, but twice.
this is not good. everyone, we must hurry.
please don't worry, we're just here to conduct a simple survey.
i'm sorry that you have to see me in this state
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
sushang's gonna use her head? now we're really done for
just some shallow intuition anyway, let's report back to the sheriff for now.
now that things have settled down, i finally have time to pay the express a visit.
a great many things are still unaccounted for
fyxestroll garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen foxian fighters at the foxsomn tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. thunder is required.
ha that i don't know. which is why i'm gearing up to solve this mystery.
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him right?
interesting... i'll have to have a closer look some time.
hello, mister gallagher, sir. judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
the general may behave slovenly, but he has plans for all the affairs of the xianzhou.
i was just strolling nearby when i noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
later on, i also sensed something similar around timaeus, so i made another one, and left it at scent of spring.
i think i get what you're saying. you think none of this was a coincidence.
yeah, she probably would've snuck away as well if i didn't drag her back.
since i do rock 'n' roll full-time, i'd say my hobby is work? what's wrong with that?
it sounds like you underestimated me. and the children, as well.
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
but, if the cute forest, meadows, and little foxes hadn't started to twirl and fade away, i really might have slept for the whole day!
our battle their battle it's just beginning.
well, let's not just stand here twiddling our thumbs. actors, to the makeup booth. we'll start on the next scene as soon as we get a working kamera.
don't worry, there's enough to go around! on the house -- order whatever you like.
i understand how hard it's been on everyone. the resistance army's rations have barely changed at all since the vision hunt decree was first announced.
making the best of every single day and living life the way i want to -- those are the most important things to me.
shortly after these two had begun their match. everyone seemed so focused on the game that i didn't want to interrupt.
i appreciate your kindness but there's no need for your words of comfort.
you want me to go through here? do i have to fight it?
no, it is impossible. i've got proof.
yes looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor
(besides, i'm an open book. it's not like you're gonna hear anything embarrassing oh, um, unless i've had a few drinks.)
master diviner, you're not the only one who can design a puzzle, and i don't tread the path of destiny alone.
ahem all in all, i appreciate the effort.
by the way, miko mentioned that she founded something called the yae publishing house to sell some sort of light novels.
who's this? herta?
i'll give it my all, so don't hold back.
as for the potential liabilities we didn't have time to discuss earlier one good place to start might be the fungi power-up materials.
even though sweet dreams are nice, they're just illusions. but for him, they're the only way to survive, even if it means giving up on reality that's not really living at all.
that you will. and make sure not to steal my targets next time!
as a guuji, there's one thing i know very well: people believe whatever they want to believe. some things you do not see, simply because you do not wish to look.
in business, everything comes down to profits versus losses. you have to keep a cool head and make rational judgments. in other words, you must be shrewd.
vowing to protect the underworlders in one breath, and then deciding they deserved to be abandoned in the next "family code of conduct" -- what a joke.
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten complicated.
fine, show me your past.
is there anything we can do to help you, mister stream?
to him, being a commentator is just extra work he was roped into. do you guys know of any places he'd go after work?
how do you feel? are you happy with your new appearance?
stealing is always wrong, and pascal needs to learn that.
heh, you truly have changed. i suppose this is what humans call "growth."
with my words, xinyan's chords, and yun jin as our mentor
the extent of the corrosion here is a lot worse than i imagined. misess hinkel did say the clean-up had been slow in places...
let me take a look. i can sense a spirit being drawn to the relic
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
it's unnecessary, as far as i'm concerned. but since you are inviting me a change of pace might well be nice.
"ride the wind and go off on a big adventure." klee, your mom sounds like a very cool person.
exactly. they traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. doesn't she sound very much like that clockie you saw?
i have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant makoto was. she predicted all the ways in which inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
the problem is, any suspicious incident could be tail-related when you think about it
does "miss sparkle's body" even count as a real character?
ah, you're too kind. it was straight from the usual playbook, if i'm honest.
if she can delegate more resources to the investigation, that should help it move forward faster.
i mean, carrying around the sword like that would be pretty conspicuous. wouldn't a thief prefer to take the case as well?
i trust you guys. but regarding what happened in the theme park, what do you hounds think about it? it's okay. feel free to speak your mind.
sweets always make you feel better! most people in sumeru love them. wanna try some? i'll get some for you!
alright, let's get started. remember, you must be graceful and elegant. don't get knocked or launched into the air, that would be most unsightly.
so as we follow the story, it leads us to specific scenes? sounds pretty innovative. what does the message in the envelope say?
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
hearing how things ended almost feels like reading the end of a light novel. now we can all rest at ease.
abolishing the sakoku decree has a myriad of implications. it would be folly to say that it will be all positive, and there will be no negative repercussions.
after all these years, i never thought i'd set eyes on this guitar again. *sigh* guess we're stuck with each other
mm, looks like one of those memory bubbles. it's not worth that much attention. you'll find many more in the other zones.
so the event's sponsor is here too? is today some sort of special occasion or something?
one day, i will hunt them down. every last one.
you can forget about escaping.
precisely. according to the rules i designed for her, matters of this nature are to be delegated to the tri-commission.
i came here to listen to your explanation. but i never imagined that, besides being good at preaching, you'd also have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge
however the homayani family has treated me with nothing but generosity and kindness.
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future
i'll ask mingxi for some more ideas later. let's go back to yancui's place.
over here, clara! wanna learn some cool poses?
let's ask verr goldet where the conqueror of demons may be.
until then, let's continue our game. it's my turn again.
a while indeed. as you can see, lisa and i are on duty.
there might be spare stove parts in the ruin. lemme see
alright, kameras will start rolling as soon as the set is ready! let's make a film that'll make some serious waves in fontaine!
no matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
going for the big reveal right at the beginning would have been an anti-climax of the most literal kind. i wanted to see how you'd react in a situation like this, and you did not disappoint
i agree. you possess many qualities similar to those of adepti, despite having none of their blood.
in other words, you still have some reservations towards me.
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them
mingxi, please ready your questions.
i can't shirk my responsibilities. i'll do it.
get up in a crowded market like this, the only person who should be trying to hide is me.
uh no, no, that's er, i'll pass.
be it my duties as her heir, or a silvermane guard, i must face my problems head-on. even if
in this story, everyone is a marechaussee hunter. to reflect this, the club has prepared a small badge for everyone.
*sigh* you never asked what the sky-faring commission does. i suppose not all commissions are created equal
anyway, thank you both. i'll remember your words of encouragement, and do my best.
gepard! way to make it obvious.
and it's not just me aeur" i think everyone else here feels the same way. if we're unhappy, we should speak up and let our voices be heard.
thank you. the cozy furnishings and peaceful atmosphere on the express put me at ease.
very well, i believe it's my turn to speak.
he probably is hopefully, we don't bump into him, but if we do, we'll just have to try and talk to him
i came up with the design, but i was never able to build it -- some of the raw materials were either too expensive or too hard to get a hold of. she helped me turn the concept into reality.
ah, chiori! you sure have changed a lot. this is the first time we've seen you since you left inazuma.
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
looks like the lord of the night has accepted this name and acknowledged you as its bearer no surprise there, considering we only got this far because of her.
way over there, see that house on the hill? that's natasha's old orphanage.
good! that's smart of you. but you needn't worry, cocolia and i aren't even on speaking terms. it was her that ejected me from the architects -- i refuse to stand with her.
the five kasen plaza is significantly less crowded now, but it's still too early to relax. this is a serious matter, and we must remain vigilant. is that clear?
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
alright, cloud retainer it is.
if we wanted to kill the prey in one strike, we would need a powerful implement. however, that also goes for prey that must be captured and safely contained.
i never thought slacking off could convince me of anything the sign of a true scholar! a diviner of the divination commission after all!
the right to punish inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. not yours, signora.
oh, by the way, which way did the doctor go when he left pardis dhyai?
don't look at me. he's the one who came up with this idea. it's up to you to accept it or not, svarog.
but i'm here to protect you all, so please don't worry. come what may, i will face it head-on.
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream
there must be some robot shells lying around the machine graveyard. everyone calls it a graveyard, but there are actually lots of useful parts buried there.
we've got one final stop. let's go.
my goodness! well, it sounds like they made quite a big catch.
candace and i came to caravan ribat on business. we ran into cyno as he was asking about some elderly gentleman's whereabouts.
this ring is a piece of evidence, right?
it's something like a tradition of ours. whenever we wrap an important performance, we'll get together and unwind.
borisin infiltrated the prison in disguise and released the prisoners, spreading chaos.
what you're seeing here is one of my puppets. i'm using her to talk to you.
it's finally time to get back to bed. goodbye, everyone.
welcome, astral expressers. looks like you caught me.
so this tablet was created not so that the hunters would be remembered by the people, but so that they would be remembered by each other.
the moon is simply magnificent tonight. we mustn't squander it. come, join me for a moonlight stroll aeur" i won't take no for an answer.
she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
i'd like you to be shikanoin's temporary supervisor. it'll be your duty to ensure that he handles his case properly and that he doesn't disappear and neglect his work again.
all we need to do is bring those disillusioned fans back to their senses to quell the rogue waves of fiendlings.
you wanna know what happens to people who vandalize exhibits? i call the silvermane guards and they carry you away!
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
i've got something to tell ya. my lady knows you're looking for ways to meet lesser lord kusanali, and she's been trying to come up with a way to help you. well, i have an idea that might help.
hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
did that all get a little heavy for you? i think you prefer me when i'm just teasing you, don't you? hehe
ah! so that's how it is, no wonder i haven't heard from bronya is she alright?
outworlder girl in a strange new land, came to perform and make her stand~
as my trusted assistants, they are always standing guard nearby. they also perform various assignments as required.
be good kids and stay out of trouble, alright? stay in the city for now, and i'll come play with you after the fireworks start.
even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
does it feel like the skysplitter has slowed down? could it be
just pointing out the facts. mister yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than i do.
i'm grateful for your assistance. now, i will leave you here in peace to proceed with your work. i still have a few items from today's schedule that need addressing.
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
well, i do know about the box and the cursed sword.
all that you have experienced during your travels is sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
i'll get in touch with wildfire and the silvermane guards right away and have them investigate the matter thoroughly. but for now let's take the parts we have back to the museum, or we'll be here all night.
there's no stopping you once you've made up your mind. fine, we'll do it your way.
as a servant, loyalty to the shogun is my duty. and as a warrior, i dedicate my life to following the way of the shogun.
my brother said the restricted zone energy lines were malfunctioning -- told me it was urgent. he doesn't trust those contracted maintenance workers so he got me in for free.
alas, our work is never this simple. putting aside all that onerous legwork, a single glance from droidhead could vaporize the entire space station if we're ill-prepared.
i hope you have a good time in pier point as well.
with everyone's help, you successfully excavate the wooden chest from the ground.
rare blessings like these we mustn't let them go to waste.
oh, come on, don't listen to his empty talk.
is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? how does it taste? and how do you cook it?
becoming a swordmaster in a mere fifteen days is quite challenging.
mister callas' last wish was for me to ensure your safety, and i will not betray his trust. he would do the same, were he alive today.
to manifest eternity per the almighty shogun's will aeur" that is what i aspire to.
there's nothing wrong with wanting to win other people's respect. but when has uncle tian ever looked down on you?
ahh, i see! silent but deadly told me something about meeting up with a friend. you must be them?
greetings to you both. this is one place i didn't expect to run into you two.
he informs you of the various locations where monsters have appeared. he looks in that general direction with a pained gaze, as if a thin, invisible thread is pulling on his wound.
kyle, can i ask you a favor? i would like you to visit the residence of minister noel and ask around regarding the whereabouts of mister norbert.
he was your tail for so many years, i'm sure he'd come back to say hi or bye.
ah, i remember now. the minister of transportation, noel, has a nephew named norbert -- i believe he's currently working in the municipal department as a transportation coordinator.
hey! you're being too loud if the culprit is nearby, he'll just run away!
you go ahead, no need to worry about us.
you must be tired after the walk back to shore. perhaps i should let you go first?
interesting. i was going to pull a little trick, but now even i'm looking forward to this.
i did tell you to let me handle it. i don't have eyes in the back of my head -- what if i accidentally hit you?
but when the kids asked me about it, i didn't wanna break it to them. i just told them that it looks cute, likes to play pranks, and doesn't hurt people.
perhaps this does not result in what you might call a fair price. but what it does do is identify the person who values the item the most.
i'm afraid that's impossible -- the artisanship commission's hall of jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process.
traveler, paimon, do you have anything planned after this?
i'm sure this is what captivated director aurelie as well.
i've actually heard all about you from beidou and kazuha. i hadn't expected to find you'd joined the resistance, though.
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, allow me to welcome you to starskiff haven.
either way, if this part of the story is true, then the rescuer has to have been an adeptus.
sure, i'd be happy to. what do you want to chat about?
sampo who is sampo?
this lot won't be able to slow down the astral express crew.
you won't even stand up for your own apprentice? what kind of master are you?
i'm the garden of recollection's memokeeper.
well done. i admit i underestimated you, but what difference would it make?
it is pointless to discuss "what-ifs." you have won. your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.
i want to do something a little self-indulgent. is that okay by you?
those brilliant purple flowers became her dazzling stage. all the gods clamored, "oh, if only time could stop at this very moment."
stephen is a kind-hearted boy, always making one feel compelled to look out for him.
yep, the same paper slips as the ones i gave to the kids earlier. whenever a customer orders fireworks for a commemorative event, we always include a little paper slip with the goods.
and when we were in dreamflux reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the crew had ever talked with clockie.
the workers here are very skilled, so i like to come to them when i need something custom-made.
ahem, it's called covert protection! keeping an ear out for what's going on around my employer is part of the job.
goodness. are people in liyue really so complex these days?
just like how the cloud knights can eliminate the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but are unable to calm the hearts and minds of the people within the alchemy commission.
(think about it long and hard)
i have something else for you also: an aether expansion chip. integrating its data into an aether spirit will grant them new, innate abilities.
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
what's the matter? are you unwilling to assist?
outlanders, if the current situation changed dramatically, could you eventually point your blades at okhema and its citizens?
one thing though aeur" we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
but now, it seems like this attitude is changing. people are starting to believe that engaging with the arts can help them balance their moods, and through that, improve their research efficiency at work.
yeah, that makes sense general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
why did you not tell your companions about my true identity?
it looks like that's where they've arranged to meet. sensible choice, i'll give them that.
why not come around today and help me with my research? you'll be the subject, by the way.
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
traveler, i know what that look means. what's on your mind?
but you'll have to promise me one thing: you'll never steal other people's things again. promise?
then the ipc would've been more brutal, and the situation would've been much harder for us thankfully, xiaohan turned out to be upright and reasonable.
it's nothing more than an empty threat, much like before aeur" a reflection of their inner fears.
for certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. but i managed to bring her a garment.
playing the violin and firing a gun both require flexible fingers, but bullets are more obedient.
that's what i've been puzzled about too. i never actually saw how phantylia managed to disguise herself as me.
shouldn't you end with some words of encouragement? you know, to fire us up now?
that i do not deny. however, final victory was always going to be ours, even had things been a little more arduous.
it's too bad he was held back by his belief in king deshret, but now that that's changed, i guess we have a few more people on our side.
huh? but i thought she wore the funeral parlor uniform with the harmony hexagram hat?
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise
do you actually believe in the stellaron hunters' prophecy?
which causes your sword's song to become somewhat mumbled at the end.
she is captivated by something that has deeply mesmerized me.
so, as long as the treacherous terrain here makes it harder for them to escape, the ten-lords commission doesn't have any complaints.
that doesn't mean i won't be making any changes to my life, though. as an example, i'm now thinking about taking on some small, odd jobs.
my alchemists detected some complex ingredients in his remains, which might explain how these borisin were able to disguise themselves as foxians.
i think we should lead with a bang, dip into a slippedy-slide, then whoosh into a woop-woop! boom.
as for that aventurine welt, i'd like to hear your thoughts.
yes this robot model probably doesn't have any kind of metal weapon.
so, what did she seem like to you?
i've never been able to really get into modern music, but i find opera enchanting. time passes like a river whenever i listen to the strings and voices in an opera performance.
hmmm honest kid. i know where you are, miss sparkle.
pretty clear, although you seem to have changed the order in the jarilo case.
just in case, i want someone who will be on my side -- in other words, you.
we'll mostly be filming typical people and scenery from the streets today to improve the sense of environmental ambiance in some parts of the film.
if he had just become a regular doctor, there would have been no issue. after all, the wangsheng funeral parlor wasn't unlike a regular doctor's clinic in the early days.
we would find the stellaron in a non-physical way?
even trouble makers hogging the photo board. all minor incidents, but it all adds up to create of lot of work for a lot of people.
hehe before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
dealing with an institution that controls all of sumeru is already hard enough if the doctor were to crash the party, it would be next to impossible for us to achieve our goals.
also, i--it's not like i'm never coming back. and if i really miss him i can just pester the heck outta him over the phone, right?
worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.
your excellency i've yet to finish the defense arrangements for the irodori festival. please excuse me.
impressive. this courtyard is every bit as striking as the headquarters of the tenryou commission.
you can go and have a look around?
that's part of it, but more importantly, i've been wondering why people link meteor showers and wishes in the first place.
don't worry about me. staying focused under pressure for as long as it takes is my specialty.
the memokeeper on the express
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
i could make a tidy sum selling some of this
hmm why don't you take a guess?
wouldn't i be taking up your time, though? i doubt this was in your schedule
understood. this time i won't fall asleep.
remember you are still on the luofu. try not to go too wild!
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
the prophecy gave him a new mission, granting him a new life as a chrysos heir. but which is more important to him: his new mission or his desire for revenge?
it's alright, i'll just read it out. if he went to the trouble of writing a letter, there must have been some important things that he wanted to say or at least, record down.
that's why i told them we were here for urgent maintenance! the front line equipment needs servicing just as much as the rest.
but if the prophecy will come true, i'll also die anyway, right? so if i've already met you as my magical meeting in this world
i thought that the story between you and the fungi would follow a master-servant paradigm, but you offered something even better: companionship, based on mutual understanding.
speaking of living in the shadows, there's probably not much difference between us. it's only polite to reveal your true self, at least when speaking to others...
oh? now that's interesting.
"what's that dolt gepard up to now? luka, you'd better fight like your life is on the line! if you lose, i'll make sure you wish you were really dead!"
what's wrong? why are you both gawking at me like that?
oh? well hello, what brings you to see me today?
i'm not the type that's easily swayed, rahman. you of all people should know that.
it must be difficult for asta. being the lead researcher isn't easy.
verification complete! congratulations on being this round's first winner, cyno!
as long as it doesn't break their employment contracts, they'll turn a blind eye.
that chess piece i told you about aeur" we can start work now. i have the traveler's measurements here.
shortly after it was found, the stone was lost in transit, and it hasn't been seen since. this stone here has all the same features, so i suspect it could be the one that went missing all those years ago.
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
the ones from before weren't defeated either?
ah, one more thing please, if you have a heart, don't make it spicy.
you could say that! but the main reason i'm here is to take part in the championship!
it's all right. there's no cure for such a symptom.
grandpa always treats me like a child. but come to think of it, at his age, who isn't a child to him?
arlan... i'm sorry. i never knew i was giving you so much pressure...
there were so many paths here, and they're all twisty-turny and up and down it's hard navigating through them all.
as for what has triggered this change, i believe it must be the loss of his vision. for to be stripped of one's vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
i'm sleepy little gui, what kind of magical elixir did you take to make you so energetic?
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea.
is that so? well, before you leave, i recommend listening to mister xiyan's legend of the high-cloud quintet.
wait, aren't we supposed to be operating in secret?
an environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
(aw, good thing i made all those preparations. seems the all-nighter i pulled last night is really paying off!)
everyone, keep your eyes and ears peeled from here on out. we don't know what lies ahead, so we have to be ready for anything.
trap? hardly. think of it as a ritual that allows us to communicate.
maybe you're right, or not. right now i just need more time to think.
is that really necessary?
mingbo's plan is more thorough and more measured. you can tell he's meticulous in his work, very detail-oriented.
leave it to me. stick close guys, and don't get spotted.
still, now's a good time to make our next move. now that rahman's joined us, we'll be an even stronger team.
hehe, don't worry. if he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
if what oleg says is true, then svarog is an architect creation leftover from the old era.
come on, now, just take it. no need to make such a fuss.
that oleg he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
i suppose a few games with you won't affect my work.
now, they're much further ahead in their studies and far more mature than their peers. this has given them confidence in themselves.
mhm, although i do have a small regret.
everyone, we meet again.
there are people within the alliance who also believe that the suspect is now on the yuque.
work is always exhausting. i've run out of chit-chat for today. come back tomorrow to talk about collaboration.
hmm that's strange
she wasn't looking for flowers and applause aeur" all she wanted was to see her audience smile.
i have a question for you, miss chevreuse. would you be willing to play the role of a musketeer?
focus on my voice, qiqi. you are not feeling sleepy. you are the most awake person in the whole world. even if everyone else falls asleep, you are going to stay wide awake.
in any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
it is. i have greatly enjoyed experiencing the adventurer lifestyle with you.
even though i initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you
since you're here i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
there it is -- it's hazy, but it's ifrit's voice. the other one is probably his progeny.
positions, everyone! we'll move on to the next scene after we try a few more kamera angles.
okay, here we go
well, i'll have an honest conversation with grandpa tomorrow, and i won't take any action against guyun until he gives me his reasons.
in an impressive display of courage, the four of you successfully defeat the uninvited guest.
only a very few people in belobog know of the existence of the stellaron. those that do would never associate it with the fragmentum or eternal freeze.
if yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
mister gallagher seems to be getting at something.
now that i've benefited from your experience, i'll try to follow your instructions the next time i'm attempting optimizations on the shogun.
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living fulfilled lives.
madam ruan mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so i asked the researchers to keep things simple.
your flying sword? oh, so that's why i found a dagger in my bag. turns out it's yours.
are ya serious, chief? all the akademiya students are in sumeru city, you know why should they pretend to be students in port ormos?
there are more merchant caravans than usual traveling the route between dornman port and mondstadt city during the festival. extra traffic means extra security is required.
moreover, how do you intend to reach the islands? without a safe and reliable plan drawn up, i'm afraid i cannot give you my approval.
alright, fine i am a person of reason, after all. you're not to blame for this.
good morning. i'm going for coffee shortly, would you like to join me? i brought coffee cups aeur" you can borrow one if you need.
there are so many silvermane guards on patrol. is it usually like this?
how about this: you tell me where those two people are, and i'll take the comb back to them for you. sound good?
i don't believe they have mondstadt's best interests at heart.
that place is full of untold dangers and mysteries. over the centuries, the finest adventurers have tried to prove themselves by venturing in sadly, most ended up perishing there.
i don't want you to feel burdened by this choice... you don't need to worry about my feelings, just go with what your heart tells you.
while i was sedated, i could still barely hear two people talking next to me. they were discussing everything from the leaves to the water and even the teacups themselves
either. both are confidential.
if you're asking from the perspective of comfort i like it very much.
no harm done. what brings you to the tenryou commission headquarters all of a sudden? is there trouble afoot?
i wouldn't say it's a perfect representation of history, but there are definitely some similarities. would you like to hear more about it?
things are really heating up now! you can feel the contestants' passion too, can't you, alhaitham?
traveler, it seems liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. do you miss it here?
it's okay, don't worry. we'll help you find her.
so be it. well then, you who would defy eternity time for you to enlighten me.
readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. if we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
i understand in that case, please go ahead with your plans first, mister boothill and miss march seventh.
you are a very lucky person, you know. you get to sit in on this lunch for free.
as i have told you, you are a suspect. before your allegations of theft and illegal entry as a stowaway are cleared, you are to remain silent. don't make me say it again.
but you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
among the piles of texts on governmental affairs and diplomacy, there were a few books on the art of war. they were like gems to me.
well, the thing is, pain is your body's way of warning you something is wrong. if you ignore it and push through you might end up with some serious injuries without even realizing it.
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
either way, in accordance with established military convention, those who demonstrate outstanding capabilities ought to be rewarded.
that tinge of regret i sense ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories i cherish.
the underworld has been struggling, but i never tried to help. i didn't even know that it was my own home that had fallen into such a dire state
i can go and find adrian taylor, or the red-nosed old man from epsilon, or even the intelligentsia guild -- at least they won't quit halfway!
he has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
i never thought i'd hear that word again after being expelled by the architects come on, i'll tell you everything.
i see. maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
actually, i was just talking to myself i don't think this question can be answered.
oh? my, you've been busier than i thought.
"outlander brigade: when the wind of death blew towards the blond samurai"? what a long name must be a new one, i've never heard of it.
master capote's life wiki version twelve point zero!
plus, the easier we can make it to enjoy, the more people will want to participate!
oh, no. he's completely captivated by the power of that cursed sword.
yanqing mentioned you before. he said that you're not to be underestimated and that your weapon has a unique shape.
his eyes are sincere, and his words ring true. you can tell that every word he spoke just now came from the bottom of his heart.
groundless accusations? mister dongsheng, you seem very sure of yourself.
but since we've decided on a debate, i'll do my best to prepare for it. i'll gather everyone's thoughts and let them be known to all during the debate.
long the permanence, idrila the beauty, ena the order, tayzzyronth the propagation akivili the trailblaze.
it appears to have a malfunction, but i think i can understand it
some remembered the names of the heroes who saved their kingdom, but others simply continued their lives none the wiser.
we're up against the akademiya. everyone knows that they're very powerful. being skeptical might actually be the more normal response.
so you're looking after your brother on your own? that must be hard.
but if you like, i could give you all a small private show any time.
my existence, hmm
i think we just made him surrender
not really. if i ever get stressed, i just go hunting.
what you mean to say is that you were targeting someone else, then. well, who was it?
this building, this playground equipment i've seen it all before.
another day, another drained social battery
the sacred sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously i get to prune it exactly how i like it.
this is the only advice i have for you, from someone burdened with a blood debt.
maybe i should take a moment to meet with march before the tournament starts?
be that as it may, i don't remember anything. there's nothing to help me make a choice.
now, time for a change of pace. where should we go?
did i sleep for long?
even inayah wants to stay with us, and she's starting to look forward to a new future.
well, you should probably write down the recipe now, no?
master left many things to me when she disappeared. there was the sword, an old key, and a good amount of junk she probably just didn't want to take with her.
true, but the story doesn't end there. that samurai's name was yanagibashi takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the souran isshin art.
ugh, i definitely didn't expect him to go that far. thankfully, the wound wasn't too deep, and he just passed out from the pain.
but i'd like to keep a closer eye on it for a while. compatibility tests should take a few days. hopefully, it will be all back to normal by then.
countless cloud knights lost their lives or became mara-struck during the crisis. the hall of karma couldn't take them all in, and so they passed away.
hey, how about i gather a few mercs to escort you two whaddya say?
and for good reason, no? a bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
right on time -- let's start the patrol.
you you just won't stop haunting me.
just our luck none of them are here today.
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that
but northland bank is a special case. i rather suspect i would not be welcome there.
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
oh thanks, but no thanks. i can't stand moving at someone else's pace.
the "replica personality module" is off. that can't be. this parameter is set to be enabled by default.
however, such a phrase may only be used during the morning hours. also, the party with whom you're speaking must be of approximately the same status as you.
we're just having a walk. neither of us could sleep. you can rescind your baseless accusations.
we should be close to completing the ceremony for this actuator.
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
with the monsters gone, the small protrusion now awaits your discovery, poking out of the ground like a shy flower bud.
my time with you has been a great help to the luofu, and a great help to me. i want to say thank you, both publicly and privately.
your name didn't even come up. so you've nothing to worry about.
i know that your only wish right now is to rest in peace. but you are the only one with answers to my deepest doubts so, forgive me for disturbing you.
but i can't just stand by and watch mister gopher wood become an enemy of the harmony. i won't use my voice to support an evil cause
hehe, it's fine, i'm indebted to you. this really is the best solution at the moment.
lyney did not need to take part in the dissolution of the young woman at all. indeed, he did leave the scene via the vent.
we can stop here. i think i know where the doctor went.
ah, so you probably got there after us
according to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain path or aeon's power.
i asked her to guide me to a place beyond the family's reach and to contact a few trustworthy individuals, namely all of you.
sounds like an unusual condition you've got there. you should stay a while in penacony!
you're pretty sharp. divination commission staff call this the "loafing gate."
now that you've had your fun, it'd be wise to leave before it's too late. the music of the harmony doesn't tolerate discord.
still stable, i suppose. do you still remember the medic who saved me in battle?
um, if you don't mind i still have important things to do. i'll go back now.
don't worry, sakujirou. so far, at least, everything is going according to plan.
perhaps the fact that the aroma of freshly cooked hot food is a welcome change from cold, pre-prepared rations.
bronya? are you okay?
of course, being a spectator is the easiest. lil gui's up there in the stands right now, watching us duke it out from her vantage point. she's such a baddie.
that's right, be confident in your work. that's exactly how a light novelist should be.
gray hair, don't be so nervous.
look at these ashes. someone was burning documents not long before we arrived.
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something and that'd just be too sad.
don't tell me you thought even i had been blindsided by the oratrice's result?
if you want a contest, i'll be the referee. the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
that is a possibility.
if you would excuse me, i should return to my work now. good luck.
i gave you the sword back then because i didn't want our friendship to end.
you can come, present or not. the gift exchange is just to make the celebration more entertaining.
the omamori from the grand narukami shrine are very potent indeed. i thought i'd put one aside for you.
watch your words, no need to be aggressive here
my name is ganyu. this is shenhe, and this is yaoyao.
i see. perhaps the narration isn't engaging enough for you that's why you find it difficult to remember the key events.
"i bestow poison in the guise of sweet dew. come the toil of spring and yield of fall, i patiently wait for the branches to be heavy with withered fruits."
hehe, now we're talking like a serious acting troupe!
march. your master has dropped out of the contest. this is a great opportunity for you to stick your neck out!
you've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
where is mavuika right now? did she tell you what she's planning?
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
*sigh* we still don't have anywhere near enough.
hey, i'm seele. i'm a member of wildfire down here in the underworld. wanna help me forge a future for the people?
it really isn't worth going into.
if you encounter any difficulties on your travels, feel free to tell me all about them.
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
so if you don't mind, i'll go and take a look at the other patients?
you heard it right. the ones responsible for the corruption in the alchemy commission are not just the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but even the divine foresight himself.
if my memory serves me right, the parts this little fella stole were originally designed for that kind of pet upgrade.
hmph, i may not be as well-read as you, but my mom taught me a thing or two!
see? my takes on fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
you're right. even though i'm not a fan, i'll help you figure something out.
you're telling me off again. fine, whatever bro. you better be going, come listen to pela and my next rehearsal.
his life became a light for so many, yet to others, it wasn't even worth remembering.
you really want to hear it that bad, huh?
but i can't abandon my brother and the other guards -- i'm a landau! it's up to you now, i believe in you. you've given me new hope!
all you need to do, dear spectator, is to witness my performance until the curtains fall.
but doesn't that mean everyone will die? i'm a fontainian just like them aeur" will i dissolve too?
don't you guys have anything better to do!? what did we do this time?
from now on, let's fight together.
(calm down, nilou first, carefully analyze what he said.)
the luofu's plaguemark is a tree, while the yaoqing's is a moon. ha, i think we got the better one.
i have a feeling that with you, i can pick up the lost threads and dispel my uncertainties.
i would never do such a thing. there was an important matter that required my attention.
oh? well this'll be fun. let's see if a forest ranger can outperform an outrider.
exactly, a rule of the silvermane guards. don't apply your rules to us.
this memory zone is overly twisted. i have to use inelegant methods, so you two please give me a little time
things will be getting messy at the fortress soon. don't run around unnecessarily.
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
as well as being willing, they would need to be an early riser and also tall enough to beat the crowds to the top-shelf items
let's start with pascal. we found him first, after all. also, like mister svarog warned, if he's not supervised, he might cause trouble
let's go. we need to get to the wardance ring!
some may find her personality unbearable -- i can understand the sentiment, but i simply don't care. of course, herta knows this too, so i accepted her invitation.
hey, you're pretty quiet. what's your name? i've got forms to fill out -- can't put your name down as blank.
i guess that's what it means literally.
according to oleg, he's a robot that took part in the war of defense over seven hundred years ago. he possesses a near-human intelligence, and rules over all the machinery in the underground
the emotionless, soulless, and merciless evil ninja osaru.
i think it should be your choice, and yours alone.
all farewells in this world are sorrowful, lord gnaeus.
legend has it the wind was unusually strong on that day, too
hee-hee, so it's just a random thought
uh she's not trying to be diplomatic about it, is she?
okay, i'm done. i also left her a note so that she knows where to find us. we won't miss her again.
just focus on taking care of yourselves, i'll figure out the rest.
when i was still one of the architects working in the scientific research division, i was researching the stellaron.
memokeeper do you think you can just leave?
of course heh, you didn't see the look on joshua's face. he could barely hold back his tears.
i remember when old mettle and i first met, we weren't very accepting of each other he said i had a bad temper, and i thought he was ugly.
do all you can to suppress them and fence them in!
especially those who came in pairs. nine times out of ten, they were here seeking to know their future fate, hoping that it would be a lifetime together.
also i am the only one out of all of us who could know what it would look like. to me, that confirms that this place really is reading our minds.
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
lyney's still talking to the gardes. it seems he'll have a lot of explaining to do
march seventh just showed me some dolls that were made to look like the members of the express crew. they're adorable.
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
are you still continuing down this path? this is a rare opportunity. leaving here will also mean leaving the truth.
other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. a little bit of this, little bit of that
i'm simply bringing up the doubts about general jing yuan that exist within the alliance. since i'm representing them, perhaps you can just imagine me as one of those old geezers?
is that really so hard? you've already written most of it. surely you can write an ending where the hunters win and justice prevails? i'll be there to help you, too.
i also enjoyed aeval's introductions to fontaine along the way. everything you described was so clear and detailed that we can't help but want to hear more.
it's a little bit like porridge? but the resemblance is only superficial
it appears that the millelith managed to get the captured treasure hoarder to talk.
just bring kusayla to me! there's no use hiding him anymore!
that marked-up map is a map of prisoners' escape routes. vidyadhara craftsmen once made blueprints for the prison's construction, so i imagine, mister taoran, you have a similar map in your possession. this pill --
i followed you. it seemed to me that danger has followed you more closely as of late.
why does it feel like he's using his praise for me as an excuse to brag about himself?
lots of children grow up learning to use a sword on the luofu, but for a child to be walking around with one
naturally, we shouldn't let our guard down. if you discover anything out of the ordinary, please report it to me at once.
prior to the competition, the judges reviewed both contestants, and we can comfortably confirm that neither side is participating in a way that contravenes the competition rules.
speak quickly, unless you want to earn yourself a one-way ticket to coupon-town.
you probably still can! want to give it a try?
mister xiao, why not try working with us? mingxi is pushing for reforms within the guild. we're nothing like the president.
thanks to her, the antimatter legion outside is not much of a threat anymore. the space station's repairs and reconstruction can also begin smoothly, but internally...
as always, to follow in the footsteps of akivili.
with the technique my cousin explained, i managed to connect several of these rattan figures to the gate array. that way, the fetor blast will be shared evenly by everyone in the array.
looks like they're not going to show up here. i'll just head straight to the artisanship commission.
many vagrants are staying here temporarily. their homes were overrun by monsters.
normally, using devices like the shifting screen is strictly forbidden, as they could help prisoners escape.
a businessman from beyond the sky? and he's not on the whistling flames' records weird, why can't i remember him?
these crates have been sitting here for many years, right? even if they have materials in them, are you sure they are still usable?
that's right. but let's discuss it once director hu's done with you.
that's why i'm here, but i wouldn't call that my wish. i don't think that alone will call the stars down for us, right?
i think i know what it will concern. even if oleg wasn't looking for me, i would've looked for him.
anyway, someone must be looking after this place. but who?
personally, i consider this project to be of greater importance than the jade chamber rebuild. that's why i'm here to supervise.
but that's still just a speculation. i don't think the master would stoop so low to make mora.
it's nothing urgent, really, just some trivial matters. but i wish to get it done as soon as possible
saika loves tricolor dango, but the adults in her family always scold her for eating too many and spoiling her appetite.
it actually doesn't matter what i do. what matters are the people i work with. when i'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. talking to you never gets old, after all.
hehe, it's kinda embarassing but i was caught up in the moment -- i guess i never thought it through
come on, let's go back and see the children.
hey! did either of you hear a word i just said!?
so it can only mean that you are happy to see me again. you have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
then you'd better ask him about it. it's got nothing to do with me.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
as a traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of inazuma. what is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
come, take a seat. we can discuss my uncle's gift while we eat.
i've been waiting a long time for this, hoolay!
i don't think i asked you what you thought of it at the time, though. what do you think? be honest.
that's why the shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. it's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
oh any idea when she'll be back?
who would be boarding the ship at this time? where are they? i'll go check it out.
the general mahamatra always comes and goes without a trace. normally, no one knows his whereabouts.
wanmin restaurant's business has been booming recently, so with chef mao being swamped with customers, and xiangling still often out in search of new recipes, i introduced shenhe to staff the restaurant.
oh, you're here already? sorry to keep you waiting. madam yukong is expecting you.
"the nature of this memory is special. don't ruin the dreamscape experience for anyone else by spoiling the ending."
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
oh, but could i rent a room to use as a command post? i need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.
she obviously doesn't understand what that word means
the retrieval of my lifeforms isn't complete yet. there's more than just one, and some are stored in a sealed zone.
managing a successful business is not as simple as you might think. capital, connections, sensitivity to the trends, an instinct for what is a good opportunity all of these traits are crucial.
i don't understand. you appear to be trying to save me, benefactor, but why are you telling me all this?
if you think the current budget will not suffice, then we'll simply have to apply for more funding from the ministry of civil affairs and wait for their approval.
we wouldn't have crossed paths.
since you weren't around, she thought you had also been grounded, and that it would be a long time before you could come out.
the next time we gather here, we must have a solid plan.
regardless of why it's designed like the conductor aboard the astral express, this doll -- is it connected to the case?
you aren't hiding anything, are you?
my ninja arts will only send the fiendlings out of this place. but fret not, i can freely use my ninja fist!
the food was specially prepared for you by everyone in the grand bazaar, and we have gifts that were sent by the residents of sumeru city when they heard we were holding a feast.
hahaha, no merc can afford to slack off on gathering intelligence! every mora i've spent in the tavern has been a valuable investment.
we have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. well, i say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
it's the same old place. everywhere you look, there are robots that have lost the ability to function
yes, but the rule of the game is no fishing rods allowed. we're going fishing by hand.
haha, i knew i could count on you!
it'll give you a chance to figure out her moves in advance and come up with a counter strategy. that should be a big help, don't you think?
she no longer needs the power of the gnosis, and in any case, she tells me she has severed ties with celestia.
hey, where've you been? i've missed you two!
it is not my intention to interfere with the merchant guild's affairs, but as an old friend i would like to remind you that aurum alley only exists in the present, not in the past.
i didn't steal the sword.
considering you two, i think you should have no problem making it to the end.
she's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
hmm i'm not sure if anyone sells this kind of thing, however
it's a tad embarrassing, but i managed to prick my finger while embroidering just now.
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
this is a big town. where should we start?
it's called professionalism, alright?
look, miss sparkle has given us a puzzle where every single answer is correct.
i know what you're thinking, but alas that girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
hmm, so you mean you don't like handling disputes over petty matters?
you can talk to me if you've something on your mind. in this world, there's no one who heals the heart better than a memokeeper.
if you would just think for a moment, it should be pretty obvious why we are here. yet now you're intentionally trying to provoke me?
she ought to meet your "one we can properly speak with" requirement, right?
in penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes that includes me. i can't deny this, nor do i seek forgiveness.
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
you frightened me for a second aeur" i thought my illusion had been undone by a bunch of monsters how did you find this place?
they're not lying, i promise you.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
it's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. this will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
now, get some rest and prepare yourselves for the operation ahead. i look forward to seeing you in action~
uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy
wait, i have an idea! how about we use a little reverse psychology? instead of chasing lady bailu, we get her to come to us!
it really seems like something that was thrown together rather quickly. its creator most likely didn't consider whether the system would function properly or not
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword"
the water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.
oh, you're here again! so, what's your decision?
i believe that this "greedy spirit" is most likely an ocean-dwelling fish. if the crystals do attract it to us, then we're a step closer to obtaining our fish scales.
treating you to some food is but a small token of our appreciation.
you learned the legends of amphoreus from those bath sprites a while ago, but that was a sanitized version that spared you from the harsh and bitter realities of our history.
never mind. i know i can't talk you out of a mindset that's been built up over a lifetime.
but i see through it all. and unlike them, i could never be hostile towards anyone who's never done anything wrong.
"go forth and establish a city of freedom without rule." we have not forgotten barbatos' wish for mondstadt.
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide this kind of work was made for him.
haven't i already made myself clear? i won't act or perform in any role ever again. no exceptions.
in principle, i should remain an outside observer. but you are far too much fun for that. i can't help but tease you from time to time.
no, we'll still need to tail him. but first, we need to do some groundwork.
liyue harbor is very inclusive. as long as you respect the rules here, you will not be turned away.
no, not at all. don't be so nervous, i'm just here to look around.
after all, this is the only place i'm able to lose the helm master uniform and relax a little.
something that mom isn't supposed to know?
that's the reason i asked for you to come here. i need your advice.
sharing senses allows communication to occur between the consciousness of different people. naturally, memories are also involved in that process.
and you likely wouldn't be willing to buy them, either.
nice story. but what's it got to do with chasing lady bailu?
sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? all these hallways really look the same to me...
no matter what stance we take when dealing with them, the outcome is always the same our efforts only result in adding more fuel to the flames.
let me put it bluntly -- aurum alley merchant guild has no chance of succeeding today.
have you talked to oleg about going to see svarog?
i clearly remember that on my first day as priestess, i had well over one hundred people come pay their respects to me.
nobody knows why svarog did any of this he usually doesn't leave the furnace core and interfere unless some kind of disorder breaks out in the underworld.
looking carefully, that indeed appears to be the case.
in her, i see the fireflies of the forest, dazzling and bewitching, yet shining only for a brief moment.
okay! i'll go ask for you right now.
but i'll redeem myself this time! i'll make sure to protect her-- uh, and also keep an eye on her
as for all the belongings left by the kaedehara clan, i will deal with them promptly.
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
who are those two little guys?
but that's the magic of a smile. if you don't believe me, try it. look at it a few times every day, and you'll understand.
but without my uncle as their puppet, there'd be no use in them attacking the city.
many challenges still lie ahead for inazuma, but i am prepared for them.
i have no doubt. but since we're alone here, may i ask you one more thing?
every journey into the unknown is a mystery waiting to be solved. but often, it is encounters with the unexpected that make the journey all the more interesting.
hmph, parasite of the remembrance. do you truly think your atrocious disguise can outwit the keen sight of a genius like myself?
knights of favonius, time is against us.
whatever's motivating them to speed up must be psychological. for instance reaching the home stretch.
alright, here's the situation. recently, a nameless domain has appeared in the araumi region. monsters with incredible strength have been pouring into the area.
you're up next, little one. come on, sit yourself down here.
we're here now, so no point dwelling on that. even though this extravaganza isn't a holiday or anything, it's still a big deal here in sumeru.
my home's located some way outside of the city, in a very quiet and peaceful area.
so it's a place that even lisa doesn't know?
strange, i never would have guessed that such a gifted chef worked here. this inn isn't particularly known for its food.
oh! what's this gadget? this monitor, and this keyboard is it an automaton remote control terminal?
sometimes i record my daily experiences in a book that way when i see my sister, i can tell her about them.
ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? sure, i'll take one.
but he and qianwei are otherwise polar opposites. mingbo is not very articulate and comes across as very timid in conversation.
it is my first day at the alchemy commission -- a brawl is definitely not how i imagined celebrating it.
of course, i have armed myself to do far more than smash your alibi. confidence cannot go unfounded, and my foundations are rock-solid.
again i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
but sampo after all this time, what made you suddenly want to take back your mask? this doesn't seem like the sampo i know
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. time for anti-raiden shogun training phase two.
nope this terminal is offline, we can't control it from here.
calm down. the war you speak of is over.
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again and such a tragedy must never recur.
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
haha, maybe it does, but i knew what i was getting into from the moment i agreed to help him.
greetings, guests from the astral express.
but i should remind you that i've never viewed you as a subordinate.
nope. i've been here a while, and she still hasn't shown up.
miss hanya, tell me straight does the ten-lords commission actually have a solution?
if you could let me know what i delivered, it would mean a lot to me!
you're the first ten-lords commission judge i've met. what do you guys do, exactly?
i bet, you were mumbling something about "stellarons" and "wishes" i couldn't make sense of it.
for someone like you, this knowledge is going to come in handy sooner or later.
but you cannot put mora above all else. you cannot go exploiting children for profit. do you have any idea just how much damage that will cause?
our objective is to deal with three of the four temples.
come on, you're too modest for your own good.
are you serious? does that little dragon girl look like she's gonna come running over to us?
you guys can hang around here, but don't run off too far -- there'll be cloud knights coming to escort you back soon. bye for now!
however, everyone in the cosmos knows of the stellaron hunters' reputation. so, why did you place so much trust in them? could it be that some of you have a connection with them?
stellaron hunter: sam.
let's go! it's time to pay a visit to pardis dhyai.
i know, right? i did a lot of research before i decided to film here
we are not completely out of options.
bumping into you like this will become a rarity. ah, i'm starting to feel sad just thinking about it.
i just feel a bit empty now that we've lost the stellaron -- i spent a long time pursuing it, after all
you were right when you said that as master diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
that sounds like her, all right. i bet she forgot which of the two she'd used by the time she got back each night.
you know what, i think her music rocks. too noisy by traditional standards, for sure, but i don't care. good music is good music. and good music should reach the widest possible audience.
but you're quite right: trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
it appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
thank you, honorary knight. i am very satisfied.
sometimes, you need an excuse to do things you otherwise couldn't, and a harbinger is more valuable than you might imagine.
welcome back. did everything go well?
yes, we're all here for you.
indeed. no longer will i ignore their passions and dreams.
the future is like a labyrinth: every divergence is merely an inducement. there is only one real path.
yes, you see things the way they are, however they may appear on the surface.
i guess it shouldn't be a problem. after all, he did get nerfed after turning into a good guy.
hey everyone! i'm not disturbing you, am i?
so that's still on your mind, huh? maybe you're the ones who can't let things go.
then, please help us pass on my request. i've never participated in a debate, and truth be told, i'm still not really confident in myself.
so i promise you that should you one day require financial assistance, you may seek employment here. i will pay you at the highest rate of remuneration.
um it's a little bitter and a little sour
it's a pity that we haven't had the chance to talk much, and now the express is about to leave. do you have any questions?
see? even march is getting bored of your rambling.
i just did what i had to do. you are special, after all so special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
it's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. but in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
or to put it another way, they were all people who have had a taste of something that was mine and convinced themselves that i am someone to be taken advantage of.
no one will disturb us now. here, how about i show you a little magic trick?
hello there! judging by your clothing, you two must be healers from the alchemy commission. my name is sushang -- i'm a cloud knight soldier. are you looking for the dragon lady who suddenly disappeared?
a compliment!? continue
so what we're going to do is create inazuma's newest hit novel.
i've never really seen this side of him before the more you learn.
if you have a target in mind, let's go investigate.
(you didn't even take cooking as one of your skill proficiencies!)
this is what age does to you. the older you get, the less adventurous you become.
need someone to talk to, hmm? aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
ugh! what, are you reading my mind now!?
the most important thing is to have no regrets in the end.
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
until today! the sweet smell on the express has awakened my memories, so
we should proceed with caution. the kujou clan descendant may well be in trouble.
still, that doesn't help us much. the ship is huge, with changing conditions across various delves. i'm sure there were showers across many of them at the time.
you're miss seele from wildfire? i came here to
well then, that's that. i've still got some other business to attend to, so shall we say goodbye for now?
ah so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
(he's started talking about procedural stuff, so i need to focus on)
that's why it's so important to develop close connections with your teammates.
yes. plus, she'll definitely want to hear how the end of the show went
mm-hmm! so, you are gonna let us in now? we need to talk to mister norbert about some important business-related matters.
if shorter wavelengths could be observed, it'd make for a good thesis... but that's not the focus of today.
generals, i am finished with my questioning.
i wish it were made up unfortunately it's all true.
ah, that's not necessary. no need to be so serious. it was nothing, really.
i warned them that their business model wouldn't work on the xianzhou without adjustments but the merchant guild's overly traditional mindset is a different obstacle.
i prefer snacks to entrees. i always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as i go. by the way, are you any good at making snacks? i'll trade the dango i made with you. here, have the big ones!
she must think the outcome of her death is worth it.
what, is he famous on the luofu or something? not even the cloud knights on the zhuming, who all know my glorious name, might recognize my face.
how deep a fully loaded vessel will sit in the water varies from ship to ship. but it's something you can tell from experience, at least for the kinds of vessels you see regularly.
i wouldn't dare "let go" and "relax." however, i am more than grateful for being able to rest here for a while.
truthfully, i've never heard of this stellaron.
yanfei, see that thing on the ground?
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath
maybe you'll find something that catches your eye.
but how about you? would you be interested in visiting inazuma?
iaeur"i assume you two traveled here together?
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
sure, do what you need to. come back when you're ready.
hehe judging by the look on your face, i'm guessing you've fallen for the rumors about me being very wealthy and having high demands for my standards of living?
i know, i understand. but please, let the ten-lords commission deal with this. we'll find a way to extract this heliobus from huohuo.
everything is turbulent and disordered if you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
yes. leave, before i let my judgment get the better of me.
i was simply being overly cautious. it is a habit of mine. apologies.
for the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices it is the right choice.
no task can be done without preparation. i just happened to notice a couple suspicious-looking people while you were out investigating.
knowing that it has your seal of approval makes me feel much more self-confident.
it seems there are three of them. looks like they can only be unlocked one at a time.
according to the ministry of civil affairs, the number of guards on patrol has to be doubled and rotated continuously during lantern rite.
no, nothing like that. the assessment itself is complete. but let me give you a word of advice: things are not always as they appear.
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
we're standing on the ceiling right now.
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
take them. i have no need.
yeah, i was gonna ask what was all that supposed to be?
otherwise, you won't even catch me in a starskiff.
that's why i was sent here -- to reassure them.
oh wow i can't imagine that. i'm sorry, the xianzhou yaoqing doesn't have much artificial snow.
of course. behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
it's a nice feeling just like the one i had before.
it's just like idrisi said i also want to catch up to my father, and become a character in his play.
if our shows are too difficult to understand or too removed from everyday life, nobody would watch them anymore
if you are willing to return what is mine, i will refund all the money you spent in the auction today.
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter
uh kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
ahh, i'm so sorry to trouble you like this i meant to invite you to our celebration, but now, you're helping me instead
wait, this part on the last page sounds strangely familiar
it's a grassroots organization. think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
the item that's supposed to be in this exhibit is a modern sculpture called gears and wisdom.
is chevreuse still not joining us today?
oh, right! if you're gonna go find lynxy, you gotta know what she looks like!
turns out that idyia has a cooking stove and oven. seriously, why didn't she mention it earlier
a stellaron? that's impossible.
traveler, paimon, please accept my sincerest apologies for delaying your meal.
the knights of favonius plan to use this as an opportunity to do some fundraising for needy children and elderly people in the city.
huh? wait, so that round bird is named tubby?
it is said that he is difficult to get along with due to his temperamental disposition, but if we approach him calmly, then things should go off without a hitch.
we foxians don't live as long as the xianzhou locals, but i still want to enjoy the hundred-odd years i've got left. you'd do the same in my shoes, wouldn't you?
bighead fiendling, educators impart knowledge, cultivate skills, and clarify doubts, but they must never deny any ninja initiate of their way of the ninja!
no one likes regrets, myself included.
be sure to arrive on time. you won't wanna miss the show.
then your help is greatly appreciated. the abyss order's sudden offensive is very strange, they have surrounded wolvendom. i am preparing to send out some knights to fight back.
i figured that i needed to venture farther than usual to really broaden my horizons.
mm that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
this has nothing to do with them. besides, the more people involved, the more problems there will be.
is it even awake in there? maybe it's broken down.
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they
march said something like that at first, too.
i'll try to think of something. we can't just let everyone suffer in a perpetual state of fear and uncertainty.
i'll keep working for a little while longer. my mind's at peak efficiency at this hour, so it's the perfect time to go through the clues and piece everything together
at this point, i'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
that was to be expected, of course. the guilty can never produce proof of their innocence.
okay aeur" confess, and we'll go easy on you. my patience is running low, so why don't you do us both a favor, hmm?
perfect! i chose it carefully -- it's perfect for beautiful young swordswomen like you and me!
because other than me, there's only one person left.
same as you guys -- on terminals.
if you're ever free to visit the space station, please come check in on us. we all miss you.
i will be hosting this hearing on behalf of the sky-faring commission. mingxi, are your people all present?
but as you can see, sir, no innocent bystanders were affected in this incident.
hello. may i ask what happened here?
little misha and old mikhail's homeland having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
experience is always the best teacher -- so go ahead and try for yourselves with these two lamps!
stay alert. this is clearly no ordinary space.
you don't recognize me? i've told you who i am already aeur" human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
then we'll build a no, we'll build a whole lot of them -- trains that look just like the astral express.
but general, the situation inside is still chaotic and perilous. your presence would be
i'm afraid that sooner or later, they are going to find you here. time is starting to run out.
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
is there any place you'd like to go? i can accompany you, i've got time.
you want to save the people of inazuma from the vision hunt decree. so do i. the only difference is that i'd rather like to save this nation and save ei while we're at it.
just some suggestions at the memory level. if something happens in everybody's memory then that something becomes a fact.
remember, let out all your frustrations before bedtime for a better night's rest. if you want, i'm more than happy to be your audience.
oh, so you're familiar with heliobi? that makes this much easier to explain.
it's a strong opening aeur" an easy way to grab the readers' attention. never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
just what crime did you commit exactly? they recalled a bunch of guards from the front line to track you down -- it's unprecedented. now they're patrolling the whole city and everyone's in a panic.
according to micah, they died long ago.
after all, it is a grand event held by the family. the guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.
personally, i think all these rumors are meaningless drivel. across the sea of stars, the divine foresight knows better than anyone else what happened on the luofu and the meaning behind it
i smelled the scent of anxiety on you, so i used the zhuming's sleeping powder and flame ambergris, mixed with sunset cinders, to make an incense called "forget all worries." let me share some with you.
hmm? was there something else you wanted to talk about?
no. when there are no other options left, it is my responsibility to alter our course of action.
several strange guards suddenly call out to you. they run forward to meet you and proceed to politely pay their respects.
there. that's the audience system's terminal. come, walk with me. we'll check what's wrong with it.
simple. it wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? so we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
if you ask me, after she lost tail, i think her urge to resign became even more apparent.
to be more precise, i was trying to look for him in the world of souls. after all, i also have no idea what he might look like
he was like a teacher and a father to you, but you chose to repay that by poisoning him whatever positive goal you may have started out with, you threw it away in that moment.
hehe. come, let's pay a visit to the venue in ritou together. i promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
don't worry about that. tribbie and i will do our best to protect the people of our holy city.
training fungi and then domesticating them?
well, i'd better carry on here, why not have a better look around? my workshop will always be open to you and your wallets, of course.
case closed! i never knew catching heliobi would require so much work
i'll be waiting off to the side. just let me know when you're done.
mm, dreams can be both good and bad because the outcome is uncertain, dreams still cannot heal everything
matsuda, uchimura aeur" i understand that you're concerned for the safety of watatsumi island.
still, i suppose i should keep on helping everyone, i am the epitome of "joy, kindness, and goodness," after all.
while i'm idling time on admiring the scenery, the spectacled snake-bedecked doc's doing surgery
after residing here for a while, i've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.
i had surmised as much. i knew you wouldn't have avoided mentioning the bird for no reason.
well, i try to keep my professional and private life separate. that includes my behavior.
but that dream with the masks, each more vivid than the last when i think about it, isn't that an allegory of my life?
once again, thank you for being kind to me. i wish you a great time in the dream, and i shall not interrupt your... date?
as for how much my insight is worth in terms of mora, everyone has their own idea. there is no standardized way to measure something like this.
that's why i'm here looking for you. sure, it's an order from my employer, but my conscience was also telling me it's the right thing to do.
dislike? we were like sisters once -- inseparable. of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian
for example, if you "fail" a check, that means you cannot use the target skill in that scenario. a "critical failure" may even result in further negative consequences.
i would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
remember when we entered the hotel in the dreamscape for the first time, and i procured a few trinkets from your companions? their functions are similar.
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
thirty years ago, my mentor served as alchemy commission's cauldron master. she recognized the emerging undercurrents and sought to cleanse the source of the disturbance.
i'll have someone remove the explosives. then, there's someone i have to go and see.
i thought you wanted to get some sleep? so maybe you should stay here and rest.
a jade seal used by the shipwrights. it opens various passages.
hah, you call yourself a member of the infamous deshret's relics, and you still can't even tell who's made it all the way to your headquarters?
we must be close i wonder who she is?
indeed. this means that these borisin have a steady supply of the medicine within the luofu.
totally used to it~ pela and i have already struck fear into the hearts of more than a few newbies.
ying'er is every bit as proficient as any of the top tailors in the land. i've availed myself of her services many times before.
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
yes. you've reached one of the better endings.
here, these rewards are for you. i hope they come in handy on the journey ahead.
as it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. but the vagrants have their own custom: see it, share it.
don't worry about it! it's just nice to go clothes shopping together.
true. but in the eyes of the denizens of abundance
the rules still stand. these little ones won the tournament and passed the ultimate trial, which means they'll be taking elchingen and kautilya's place.
you may not know me, traveler and paimon, but i've certainly heard about you.
i should draft a report about this experience.
done spacing out, ororon? did you finish your homework?
that's why we hope that your time at zubayr theater will become a fond memory of your journey. you two are welcome back anytime!
hmm, what sauce should i pick for my macaroni tonight?
if my understanding is correct honorary knight, i suggest that you place the crystals in the sea.
once you draw your sword you must strike down your adversary in one blow without turning back.
an aesthetic you share, miss acheron.
we both still have our own paths to walk. so let's forge ahead. hopefully, if we meet again... it'll be beneath clear skies.
if it involves helping people in need, count me in too.
we're friends of his. he's been telling us how impressed he is with the quality considering how affordable it was, so we just had to come and take a look for ourselves.
here, this medicine is named "yabruh." a tiny dose can numb the body's senses and alleviate any sensation of pain.
hmm that would be quite strange, yet such a scenario can't be ruled out.
if you're so keen to stay fine. i'm okay with it. go speak to asta. she's the lead researcher. she's in charge.
hey, way to boost morale over there!
bernard claims to have received a letter last night from pierre. in the letter, pierre stated that he had gone into hiding. is there something wrong with the letter?
so mister boothill, i'm familiar with the galaxy rangers and their exploits, as well as with the entities they pursue.
you're too modest. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall was worth much more than that.
you mean the "academic fraud" mister reca mentioned? i can't believe that sort of thing happens in paperfold university, too.
oh, look! the door opened! you guys really aced that first puzzle!
i have no clue what you two are talking about, but it's still dangerous here, soaeur"
yes, i grew up here, listening to the sound of waves while researching prescriptions with my mentors and peers at the alchemy commission.
i will protect you. once i gather more information from him, i'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
i thought so too. it's most likely some rule of penacony's, or the family's.
in the art of healing, i certainly could not compare to the luofu's high elder. but in these games of politics, i still take pride in being able to protect her.
i won't comment on anything else, but the script was good.
no no no, you must be prudent with your words. calling someone a "good friend" could easily offend them.
so, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
unsurprisingly, the communications zone is where a bridge for communication will be formed between droidhead and the space station.
alright, i won't tease the two of you any further.
we can't trust everything kafka says. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
your first priority is to prove yourself innocent, after all. i'm sure there is little that needs to be kept secret now unless your "script" already has holes in it.
in the time it took you to get here, i already did five laps around the place, downed seven drinks, and even did some clothes shopping.
to me, that says that whoever's behind this has moved them somewhere else to throw our investigation off course.
stay here, warrior do not leave your goddess of death. the enticing scent of blood here is meant for you, and only you
i know they're wary of me, but this is still an overreaction, surely
r--really? we don't need to ask miss natasha first?
it is my honor to work alongside you all. praise be for the anemo archon's guidance
oh, yes, but i thought we'd meet at the jade chamber. why have you come here?
what can i say sounds like a lynxy expedition alright.
while there aren't any people in this mansion... they've set up quite a few memetic guards to patrol this place.
but i've always regarded it as nothing more than the source of my loneliness.
i want to re-live that time from my life, feel some of that drive again. take a trip down memory lane.
i'll stay outside and provide what stability i can. i'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
thank you for inviting me onto the express! if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the zhuming!
why are you so interested in it?
even if we'd done nothing at all, shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
people join wildfire for themselves, for the newborn next door without a mother, for the elderly with no home to return to.
but their leader seems like a reasonable individual. oleg and i have our differences in understanding, but we respect each other's opinion.
your name is a special case. there were quite a few headaches along the way, which slowed the progress.
i actually thought you had cooked it all yourself
garvipidam, perhaps you should see what your friend sent you in the package.
alright, so you want to do this the hard way.
oh, really? "only" sixteen system hours? well, let me lend you a hand.
oh you brave and fearless trailblazers, you benevolent nameless, can you really remain indifferent to that?
when i returned to inazuma, i was shocked to find that a great sakura tree had appeared on mt. yougou. the tree that you know as the sacred sakura.
her son, sohrin, has already passed his theater exam, and he'll soon be our newest member.
doushin shikanoin, i see you've finally returned. please, enlighten us, what have you been doing recently?
what's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? seems pretty normal to me.
indeed. then perhaps you could tell us everything that happened during that one minute.
don't worry, i've got enough money with me.
*sigh* i was hoping to avoid a conflict with the cloud knights. how about this
sure, and then you can forget about any nice words from us.
we protect businesses, the ipc sacrifices them for their own gain.
fine, i'm just spitballing here. don't take it so seriously
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
plus, you don't have to keep an eye out for monsters popping out of the ground or vultures swooping down from the sky.
i can't believe you ended up back here on the skysplitter after running around all over the place. but, you're too late to enter the tournament now.
since we can't determine if your shipment is safe for the environment, i guess we'll have to wait for its biological activity to expire. let me check the previous cases
since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? i'll need your help with the ritual.
wrong. none of it would have been possible without winning the hearts of local businesses.
oh, really? i think that towering tree looks pretty impressive.
did mister svarog consider that for me? maybe i shouldn't disappoint him
given the situation on the luofu, those on the yaoqing are concerned about hoolay's imprisonment. i'm afraid that the routine visit every century is no longer sufficient to ease their concerns.
ah i also have a few new things to teach you. alright, follow me.
but later on, she would actually smile down at me and say, "just the opposite, in fact."
so you guys aren't that close after all? i thought you were sworn friends.
then i'll look forward to seeing your performance.
he's in serious condition, be sure he gets immediate medical attention.
i'm going too. we can't let these thugs get away with whatever they like!
as for rahman, your guess is as good as mine. i only remember he said that he had something to discuss with cyno you can ask cyno when you meet him.
please keep everything i'm about to say to yourselves. no one else can know. otherwise
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
outlanders, why did you lend your aid to okhema?
oh, it's you. it seems your investigation went well.
gradually, it developed into a lucrative business.
once you are ready, please assemble here, and we'll head over on the boat together.
bingo. i think you got it. seems like you're learning.
oh, yeah. he's a student at the akademiya. we met during the last interdarshan championship. he was representing the vahumana darshan.
and yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. a testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
and besides, you've never attended a celebration event before, so this will be a great opportunity. everyone will love you!
the more time you have the more friends you lose.
about your childhood? no, nothing at all.
if you choose "easy mode" instead, every check will be successful by default, and you won't have to worry about luck playing a factor.
there's something wrong with this one
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
i'm sorry, you probably just wanted a relaxing stroll, and here i am dumping all this heavy stuff on you.
one thing will never change, though. we'll always have the memories we made together during this time.
the qixing have approved ganyu's proposal. over the next few days, i will be working with mister dvorak on behalf of the qixing to facilitate the organization of this concert.
the stage is already set, so there's no reason to disappoint the audience. let's see this trial through to the very end!
not exactly aeur" it's not so much that one's more powerful than the other ugh, but never mind, that's not important. it would take too much time to explain.
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
you're leaving? actually, i suddenly have a craving for some good food let's go, i'll treat you. don't worry, i have some pocket money from grandpa.
got it. but it sounds like mister assistant detective has his own misgivings would you like to go over it again?
i do believe he was prepared for that outcome. i could see it in his eyes.
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
please leave pascal to me. it was my decision to keep him in the first place, so i must take full responsibility.
some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside bracelets and jewelry. we put the bigger ones into instruments of calculation so we can simulate the future and learn from the past.
don't rush, we still have time. think about it first and ask when you're ready.
oh, that~ it's a botanical specimen -- little lynxy sent it during one of her research trips.
of course i do. it was never my intention to place control of inazuma into anybody else's hands.
that's probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly
this isn't something the healers at the alchemy commission can handle. i'll take huohuo back to the ten-lords commission -- perhaps they'll have an answer.
thank you, everyone. i feel a lot less nervous with your support!
i'm so sorry, arlan. until i spoke with dan heng, i never realized how much pressure was on your shoulders.
you even have enough time for leisure? it seems you three are a suitable replacement for me after all.
if my stage were anything like that i'd be thrilled if i had just two real padisarahs on the stage.
i believe i now understand the situation.
i have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. i'm sure she was as happy as can be.
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
so i told him about the express, and eventually he stopped crying and started asking so many questions.
sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. he didn't say why. still, i'll wager it had something to do with him -- he's always tinkering with his devices.
in other words, fireworks symbolize the past.
not much, but i didn't bring my coin purse.
fulfill this pact between us, and you can expect your journey on amphoreus to be free of troubles.
why don't you return to mondstadt and tell your parents what you just told us?
um not quite my taste. "high speed" doesn't quite do the express justice.
just like everyone in this story, hurtling onwards along the path of destiny with passion and courage, for the things that breathe meaning into their lives.
if there's any other way i can help you, i'll do my best! but this
huh, you do seem to travel light. but don't you at least need some pajamas!?
a shattered emptiness draped in the guise of desire... his existence is strikingly powerful, yet the self beneath is extraordinarily faint.
next, i'll be introducing the history of the museum. everyone, listen carefully, okay?
seeing isn't always believing, and if you can't trust your eyes, you certainly can't trust rumors.
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of
i hope the jade chamber will always float in the skies above liyue harbor, bearing witness to the prosperity and peace of the human world
hmm out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine point five!
great, i'll take you up on that offer.
just leave it to me aeur" i'm a professional.
in that case, let me try again aeur" this time using both leyla's body and the shard as mediums.
throwing all of sumeru into chaos is the only way to change the way of life here in the desert. anyway, that's my guess why they've chosen to become radicals.
hmm, something tells me you just want to finish the free desserts before we break for the day
ugh the syrup has turned clumpy i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
but before you do, i would make a request of you.
yes, but why?
but i'm sure if you keep going as you are, getting yourselves involved in other people's business all the time, you're sure to get caught up in another misadventure before too long.
here, take this, little guest. this gift has been specially prepared for you by the family.
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
the lighting on the express is perfect for observations. great views at the windows too.
mm here you are. i hope the medicine is of help to you
my eyes might not be as pretty as yours, but there's no problem with my vision
that's it! the thing shaped like a giant iron ball.
i meant my lifetime.
i'd like to hear their explanations.
alright, alright, let's save the awards speech for later, and hopefully also get some rehearsals in before the real thing.
though these immortal mountains have lost an adeptus, the harbor of mortals has gained a wise elder.
you have to be more specific, captain beidou.
for now, i'll leave this domain in your hands. please keep a careful watch.
in the grand fabric of life, both parents are equal, and thus my name combines the surnames of each of my parents.
until we're back in the overworld, i propose a temporary truce and cooperation. your true intentions are of interest to me
how did the conversation get so heavy again!? no good -- let's talk about something interesting.
the depth he goes into in each and every area means it can only be a product of painstaking work. plus, he is modest and good at dealing with people.
gepard? not a chance he's a decent guy, but also famously uncompromising.
careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
we know the essence of your trial of the heart, and we also know that you asked dan heng to help you complete the trial of the mirror.
uhhh, no thanks. this is actually sounding pretty weird.
you witnessed human memories leaking from the ley lines, didn't you? well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
all right, everyone. let's make a decision.
distinguished guests, since you have spared no effort in aiding the holy city, i will naturally take care of you as well.
by imprisoning hoolay in the xianzhou luofu, the marshal both suppressed the dangerous intentions of the yaoqing foxians and warned the xianzhou luofu to refrain from repeating its mistake.
by sending out coupons and gifts, we attracted twice as many customers as we normally would. this shows that food is still a big reason why people visit the alley.
whether it's a dragon lady like you or an ordinary person like me, i feel like many people's lives follow a similar trajectory.
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you
yes. i never observed it directly, but i used lab simulations and outbound surveys to establish a rough location.
also, i'm fairly certain that hilichurls can't write stories. so does this author claim to be documenting hilichurl life from an outside perspective, perhaps?
if you want to move the audience with your music, you must fully commit and immerse yourself in your role, pouring all your emotion into your performance.
if you're interested, i can give you a referral. that should give you a forty% discount on membership fees.
oh, how should i know! it's up to you, you have so many options to choose from. maybe jump out a hatch, or hop into the fragmentum and see if any monsters start worshiping you?
let's not touch it for now. we still don't know enough about our environment.
a witness ah, yes. i've heard that you came to teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? in other words, you never belonged here
isn't it just like cooking food over an open flame? if the house is a pot, then the heater is the stove it rests on.
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
come, let's take a look around the contestant hall.
i'd like to hold this ceremony as a way of distancing the memory of tingyun from the lord ravager who tarnished her identity.
so i'll let you hire me, my lady. this way, everyone wins. as for the pay let's say half of what your father pays me. we can settle the bill when we return to the estate.
(it'll probably still take some time, though. so, bear with me for now.)
though they are unable to return to mondstadt and spend the festival with us, the weinlesefest will nonetheless be a major event that all of mondstadt is looking forward to.
it's been a while, kujou sara. i believe the last time we met was on the battlefield.
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
the scissor-tailed swallow is the most classic design. it symbolizes good fortune and joyful tidings. different colors also have small variations in meaning.
kaeya, i've approved your vacation request, use this time to relax and unwind. don't worry about the report and other work, i'll take care of it.
that's right, i mean you, traveler. you'll support lyney, won't you? after all, he was the one who helped you the first time we met.
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
it's just because of the ritual. it makes it so that everyone can see them. i know they look like ghosts, but it shouldn't last long
you let that status of yours go to your head, huh? afraid to show weakness? that's why you're keeping so much bottled up inside, right?
why don't i watch the store? as it happens, i know a thing or two about perfume.
but with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, i need time to give it some thought.
oh, right, you guys call it a "camera"! anyway, did that all make sense?
indeed, we need some time to digest such a wealth of information.
hehe, so i'm right? is this lesser lord kusanali responding to our celebration of the sabzeruz festival?
according to tighnari, the doctor is leaving sumeru soon. i want to check if the doctor was actually telling the truth.
xiangling, you have an adeptal affinity. guoba follows you around because he has respect for you.
you're just a mirror. i don't need you to take on comic relief too.
no matter the method employed, our bodies will eventually return to their original states.
so is this a real musket?
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
nope, i'm not about to suffer in pain. it's much easier being a coach, hehe.
it's alright, don't worry. there just seems to be some kind of misunderstanding here. why don't you take this opportunity to clear it up? don't you think that'd be best?
yes, but his faith and determination were conveyed to the dendro archon, so she blessed him in the form of a dream.
i'm sure she knows it better than i do.
you're right but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
er just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it?
i'm sushang, and i recently joined the cloud knights. talk to me if you have any issues but i don't know the luofu very well either, hehe.
where are you where are you
are you sure? i'm not well-read, so i might really believe you!
herta uses that place to welcome visitors from across the stars, or to welcome members of the genius society. however, due to the legion's invasion, it is no longer open to the public.
these millelith are just here to guard the scene, not to arrest anyone.
hmm, don't think there's anything here how about we check out somewhere else?
there is still some preparation to do, but don't worry. everything's on track.
i understand why you're trying to make her the hero of the story, but isn't she your hero already? after everything she did for you?
rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
it was all a premeditated trap to stir up chaos on the space station!
surprised? my reasons are pretty simple.
svarog claims to be a guardian of humanity -- all the ownerless robots obey his commands. they've occupied the furnace core hub, and they're not letting anyone get close.
if there were no injured animals, that means there was no war, which means the world is at peace.
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
oh? you recognized me right away. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "death."
we have no means to wake them up now. not even your clockwork will do the trick.
if i get the chance, i'd love to bring my telescope onto the express.
but i have to say, after clearing out all those unnecessary items, i feel much more refreshed.
so everything here was built according to your designs? i did not know you possessed such abilities.
yes aeur" i've put a lot of thought into it.
once a soul becomes lost, it can never return to the night kingdom. lost souls can only wander listlessly, gradually fading from existence before disappearing entirely.
this light cone... is securely guarded. it must hold some important memories.
i'm sorry, you two. i didn't mean to bring up any sad memories
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to
say no more. there's no doubt, it's a demonic curse alright aeur" and a serious one at that.
ah, sorry to make you two come all the way out here.
i may be getting ahead of myself, but for amphoreus, i am willing to take a chance on you.
hm, you could be right.
uh not the kind of waves that drown everyone, i mean the good kind of waves
you've been on the xianzhou for this long and you've never heard of the ten-lords commission?
anyway. i'm sure tsuyuko will have told you that the watatsumi goryou matsuri is a ceremony to reverse the holy soil phenomenon on watatsumi island.
the only one that strikes me as a little unusual is the qingxu pool redevelopment plan.
every day all i hear is "remember who you are, bronya," "this is against the architects' admonishments, bronya," "ladies shouldn't use such foul language, bronya"
qiqi likes finches, right? i'm thinking of making her one out of rattan! do you know her favorite color?
i hope that when we meet again, we can continue these sit-down discussions settling our differences on the battlefield is rather taxing.
no matter how long it takes, i am committed to bringing this to fruition. this is my promise.
sewing is an art in its own right. you're more talented than you give yourself credit for, idyia.
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
i am not who you think i am, nor will my home be as fortunate as your world.
in the end, we still came full circle.
we must seal the entrance before the borisin fugitives get out.
i used to think just like that samurai that i was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
the boundless cosmos unfolded before me. i was completely mesmerized, not just by the view, but by a realization--
heh, well, i was the biggest star in all of fontaine, after all. it takes more than just a pretty face to earn a reputation like that. i know how to get serious when the situation calls for it.
gepard, can you lend your dear sister a hand? help me pack my bags~
and yes, things are going well for me too -- thanks for asking!
seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker -- she takes decisive action. she'll definitely be able to help you. not to mention you also have bronya now.
looks like you have yet to forgive me i understand.
but before leaving, i'm sure you all have plenty to say to the nameless of the past?
you two have my thanks. you have done much for me, and i will never forget it.
i'd be surprised to find someone with the exact same first and last name. shahzaman homayani is dunyarzad's father, and the head of the homayani family.
besides, you'll be at the meeting! if any problems do pop up, you'll have no problem navigating them.
we can't let that happen, though. not only would everyone involved in the theater go hungry, but then we wouldn't be able to hold the sabzeruz festival anymore.
i suggest that you act just before sunrise, while most people are tired and resting. you may find some important leads.
goodness, what's all the commotion over here? discussing something interesting behind my back?
no need to stay on our account. we just got up here, so we're going to stay around for a little longer.
ahem ah, yes, ningguang and i have different scopes of work, you see, and ganyu has to report to both of us respectively. it's indeed not easy for her.
to be brutally honest, "we took out a loan and made a speculative investment" is not a sob story.
hi, astral expressers well, you caught me.
but things are a little different with these particular informants. mora doesn't get you very far with this crowd
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy
even though you couldn't see it through to the final scene, the audience was very impressed by your performance. it's safe to say that you made your mark on this memorial show.
to the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. luckily, i'm ei's familiar, so i can sense her rough whereabouts.
wait if my suspicion is correct, are you skulking about in the filth to keep something hidden?
so this set is going to be a part of the script?
i was just teasing, but she gave it some serious thought, nodded, and really hit the ground running after that it's like my joke lit a fire under her or something.
farewell, nameless.
true. that's one reason why it's been difficult to catch on.
i'll be sure to keep your suggestion firmly in mind.
it's nothing forget i said anything.
the liyue qixing always repay their debts. and as you have heard, our eyes see far and our reach is long.
a man dressed in dark clothes, likely a minister, shields his mouth with his hands and bends down to whisper a few words to the king.
don't worry. this tuskpir is a personal pet of mine. i can lend it to you for this treatment, but you have to take good care of it for me.
these mara-struck soldiers don't appear to be escaped prisoners.
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
in sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
don't worry about it! that misunderstanding is all in the past now.
oh? seems you haven't seen his other side
imagine if all the traveler ever thought about was making you stronger, forcing you to build rock-hard muscles just to watch you send mitachurls flying would you gladly comply?
wriothesley gets really invested in that sort of thing. but he couldn't care less about what he wins in the end.
hmm quite impressive.
strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here
every side of me is the real me. people just like to define things in all sorts of arbitrary ways.
since the culprit's trying to be cautious and low-risk, i'll bet they left through an area with some vegetation for cover aeur" but not so much that it would slow them down.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
my greetings to the both of you. long time no see.
that was her first experience with the "sky."
anyway, for a mortal to be able to repair an adepti mechanism is quite the mystery, even to the qixing.
hold on, i'm coming over.
alright. then i'll mark down furina for "easy mode." all her checks will be successful by default. as usual, navia and lyney will play on "authentic mode."
the old me? i used to be a knight of beauty.
"i was suddenly seized with an urge to write a letter after finishing this bottle. i just folded it up and left it in the bottle, though. if i end up forgetting about it, it won't really matter."
yes, photographs often record very precious memories.
cirrus may not know the location of tail, but they still figured out a way to divert everyone's attention.
he expressed a desire to be on the front line, so i honored his wishes.
alright. i'll leave my cousin to you, then.
i've checked the area, nothing strikes me as out of the ordinary. looks like this chapter has come to a close.
that's right. although there were a few hiccups here and there, the sabzeruz festival turned out to be a grand success!
that's where the joy lies. even the most predictable storylines can have their pleasant surprises.
i have gathered everyone here today to make an important announcement.
your arrival is timely -- this dreamscape is fraught with danger. since our destination is the same, how about we join forces?
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
since mister luka is really popular, he'll definitely clear the popularity revival vote and return! please cheer him on!
the tag on the tie reads "only for imperial master lefton" seems like it's one of miss sparkle's personal belongings.
no, no, though i'd appreciate it if you mention to madam yukong that you got a warm reception from me when you next see her. *sigh* better to be busy than idle, i suppose.
take this man away. this does not involve him.
thanks for telling me everything. i didn't think things would get so out of hand
if you must know, it's a little complicated but simply put, i'm searching for a cousin of mine from the lawrence clan.
in my opinion, you enjoy playing the role of a joker, spouting off outrageous opinions just to seem objective and indifferent whenever you feel like it.
the traveler is right. you once investigated that underwater sinthe base, and recovered items belonging to the victims.
i'm not gonna let you off the hook that easy -- there's more to this story. you need to explain what the heck got into you today.
wow, you answered in a heartbeat!
still, it'd be nice if those kids would stop littering it's barely lunchtime and i've already picked up three half-eaten packs of snow-white popping candy.
you should thank the traveler this time, doushin shikanoin. otherwise, i don't think i would have let you off so easily.
oh, that's a letter i was gonna send to my mom. i haven't even finished writing it.
zubayr theater isn't simply a performance venue to us aeur" it means more than that. it's been our home for a long time.
xiaohan is the ipc's operation rep in exalting sanctum.
so my plan is to incite rebellion in the tenryou commission.
you'd make sure that i didn't notice anything amiss, before revealing yourself as my prosecutor once we'd arrived onto the stage
thank the dendro archon for dunyarzad! with the mora she gave us, we hired someone to patch up the tree, and we also gave the stage a much-needed makeover.
stay still, benefactors my instinct tells me something's not right here.
unfortunately, i don't know how to use the "magic" of this world. i've tried using my vision, but it doesn't seem to work here
my father probably thought that people could settle into new lives as long as they moved to a new environment.
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know
in that case as a leader, i must give you a promise of the same weight.
perhaps it's best to let go now, while my feelings for pascal aren't as strong?
if you get hit by the musou no hitotachi, that's it. it's game over. i would get training if i were you.
since i'm already wearing the costume, though, i might as well try to play the part. it's what a professional dancer would do.
yeah but since she brushed it aside when the tianquan asked her about it, i don't see how i can broach the topic. i've only known her for a few days
klee? oh, and it's the honorary knight and paimon as well.
but after the almighty shogun's loss, i'm afraid that lady guuji may also have caught wind of kokomi's strategies.
a razor, some buttons, some round iron tiles, a wooden toy puppet
centuries ago, an emanator of abundance besieged the luofu with the aim of taking the ambrosial arbor. they destroyed half our delves and killed most of the cloud knights.
of course! this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- i can't miss it.
everyone should enjoy the break while it lasts! i'll convene everyone when the fish arrives.
"monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. what started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
the charmony festival will start soon. there's one thing that... i need to confirm no matter what. a warp jump is the best way to do so.
that object was pretty important to you, right?
and we've already defeated florian, right? so, he won't try to take it from us anymore.
the sparkle murder case? wasn't the victim shamari from the ipc?
amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. take a rest if you need one. don't put too much pressure on yourself.
y'know, you're getting less silent and more deadly by the minute! sounds good, let's get it!
wait. kaeya, if you're here, who is overseeing the knights of favonius?
haha, just kidding! i love seeing that look on your face. take this key to the tavern cellar. third barrel on the left. you never saw me.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
she was there. she just made sure no one could see her.
you can't even imagine the atmosphere there -- even someone as heartless as me got the chills! i only stayed for a day before i couldn't take it anymore and slipped away.
mm-hmm. catching up with an old friend i hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.
more about me? mm i don't mind. i only worry that you may find the topic a little boring.
did you now? well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
if silver needs to be polished to shine, it only makes sense that we need to keep honing our skills to become as light and swift as a swallow.
anyway, i'll take this core back and examine it. now, let's insert pascal's core into the big fella's shell.
leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of inazumans.
but if you're going to work in the space station long-term, the stellaron may have some serious effects on the station's fragmentum. as the lead researcher, that's a risk i cannot take.
there's no way someone like him could've come up with the idea of disassembling a sculpture and hiding the pieces inside robots.
indulge my curiosity. what is the reason that i find you standing here before me once again?
i don't think we have to be too self-conscious, but it's still something to keep in mind.
your match is over too? you took your time. i'm assuming it was a close call
pengyi? what's wrong? what are you doing here?
darn, can't activate it. it seems like someone's severed the energy supply to the terminals.
so the master was not likely an innocent victim in all of this?
we came here to save lives. one arm for that many people is still a pretty good deal if you ask me. rahman, i'm holding up my end of the deal here. you'd better not let me down.
lynxy? she's more like me. ah, don't tell my brother that, he hates hearing it.
how do i put this you're no match for her at all.
what she really wanted to say was this: "how soon do you think you could open a branch in the plane of euthymia?"
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
yes, and once we're done, we will find a merchant to give us an appraisal of their value.
worth focusing on? oh, no problem. i'll leave it to you then.
rejected. you failed to inform the gm of this course of action. moreover, the guards would have conducted a thorough search before throwing you in prison.
haha, oh yeah? well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
come now, there's no need to stand on ceremony. loosen up a little.
but one by one, all the obstacles are being removed. now is the time to rally the troops.
true now that i think about it, cloud retainer would be quite capable of taking care of anything on her own there's no need to worry about her.
i must have been chosen from among the children here and then taken to the surface
of course. this is a prototype designed by yae publishing house's top artist and crafted by the most skilled lacquerware master in inazuma city
your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. something that shines in unison with fate itself.
uh-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. you'd better fill me in.
i see. well, when you put it that way looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
hey! silver wolf! look! it's screwllum, your good old opponent.
i'm glad. the answer itself doesn't matter. what matters is that you've made a decision.
once the whole dendro archon thing has settled, everything in sumeru will take a turn for the better. that makes me happy, too.
lefton's suspicion level can be downgraded.
for sure. you have a unique constitution and a lot of potential. with your strength, wielding a baseball bat is no problem at all.
now go and experience it for yourself. i will guide you in the simulated universe to make sure nothing happens to you! i'll even give you a substantial reward.
i've come to see myself clearly in this dream journey. perhaps it's what people call a blessing in disguise.
but for some reason, there's a hollowed-out space beneath the tavern where i couldn't sense anything at all
even among the fools i know, miss sparkle's sense of humor stands out from the rest.
i'm yae miko, a light novel editor aeur" purely out of personal interest, and right now, what i'm most interested in is you nice to meet you. the pleasure is all mine.
madam yukong, you were once a "survivor" in the war too, weren't you?
i see but why aren't the other people around here scared?
rather than hearing endless explanations, would you like to experience it for yourself?
as soon as herta got bored, she forgot about the whole thing, but all her research was recorded in screwllum's database. silver wolf retrieved it when she hacked into planet screwllum
i don't want herta to worry herself over these frivolous matters, even though she probably wouldn't care anyway.
the fatui are dishonest, but they wouldn't go as far as to start an open war. their opposition wouldn't just be mondstadt alone
then explain the purpose of the "evil sorcerer" in your story.
i know what i'm doing, dunn! step aside.
i forgot to introduce myself. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
oh, nothing. it's just i sensed a very powerful magical signature just now
the masters of the night-wind believe they can see human souls, and in ororon's fragmented soul, they saw a possibility for natlan
i am currently unwilling to deal with any business. i am also incapable of it.
forget that, there's no time. right now, we need to inform the whole army to cease using their delusions immediately.
i can't believe my own eyes either, but i know that sculpture inside and out.
sometimes i stand at the door of the clinic and watch her running and jumping around and my tiredness simply goes away.
no, we shouldn't do what they expect us to. they've been manipulating us from fyxestroll garden all along. we need to find out what they really want before we go any further.
huh, okay any particular reason?
 then perhaps there won't be any reason for me to go on the journey with you after all.
in the dark of shadow, our heroes seek to find, where creatures born of evil, weave their grand design.
i'm sorry, i invited you to come and watch the fireworks, but now i have to run a few errands.
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps
the stage is going to be even prettier when it's festival time! i can't wait for you to see it!
a trap comprises of the following components: bait, a trigger, and a containment device. sometimes, a lethal implement will also be necessary to deal with the prey.
return to the world? what are you saying?
you're saying that the ipc is in it for the ipc, but we just want what's best for aurum alley
oh? mister dongsheng, i'd like to hear a little more about this "dirty laundry." would you care to elaborate?
well now, don't you all look disappointed? don't tell me that your investigation came up empty-handed?
miss fu xuan? is that you?
enough about sampo! we need him for this trip, and we can still get rid of him after we reach the surface.
later, the master told me that i was one of the best mercenaries he'd ever seen, and that i should stick around to become one of his bodyguards.
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
you have keen observation skills, and a love for living things. you'd be better served directing your energies there rather than sighing and whining all the time.
youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. whatever shall we do?
i've asked the millelith on guard at qingce village to report this to the ministry of civil affairs. they will organize a search around that warehouse.
then we need to get moving. the longer they have to react, the fewer clues they'll leave behind.
if it's okay with you, would you let me borrow the shinrou casket from the domain's core?
*sigh* if i'm not careful i'll start boring you all with sob stories from the past. let's get back to you guys. if long-lost bronya told you to come here, you must have something important to tell me?
i'm really sorry about what happened back in the great mine mister svarog doesn't trust any humans besides me, especially everyone from wildfire.
who's to say there isn't an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?
i know what you've been up to. smuggling weapons to violent brigades in the desert while working for the corps? pretty bold if you ask me.
it has been brought to my attention, yes.
jeez, you sure do love to procrastinate.
you're gonna have to step it up, y'know. my record is six days no shut-eye.
i'll be at uyuu restaurant aeur" find me there when you're done. i will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
this has certainly been a memorable series of events.
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
kinda like fireworks, in a way. don't question it, just feel it
but if we were to change the siblings to two sisters of a similar age then that aspect of the story might come through more clearly.
you want to stay here? no, no, the artisanship commission isn't safe enough. how about this -- i'll escort you and mister luocha a little further.
they should have thought about whether they were capable of paying the price when seeking the power of an aeon.
...wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. your gamble... is not over yet.
back when i decided to isolate myself in the plane of euthymia, there was no yae publishing house, and certainly no stories of this kind.
oh? hello there, little ones.
there's something i need your help with -- i had to make it up to you somehow.
i grew up with these guys, and i know they're not bad people. it's just that some situations get so bad that it's difficult to tell good from evil
sure, why not. i should have some time later. i'll let you know.
the rations we brought were adapted from my signature moon pies. to come up with something even tastier i gotta hand it to you, you did a great job!
"unlikely, potential" meaning there could still be conflicts
as for screwllum he's a good-hearted noble. it's just that his area of interest doesn't quite align with my research goals.
allow me to introduce myself. i'm lingsha, cauldron master and head of the alchemy commission on the luofu.
oh, don't say that. besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
he heard that the miners and vagrants had begun to engage in a large-scale conflict he wanted to stop everyone from getting hurt fighting over the mines.
reserved? really?
haha, he's my little brother, of course i don't want to leave him alone. but i don't have any other choice.
i hate removing splinters. you have to squint so hard to see them, and i always end up hurting myself i've cut all ten of my fingers that way
rest assured, i am not prone to misjudgment.
so it's not that you wish upon shooting stars, but that wishes summon them?
would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at yae publishing house instead?
humans overestimate the infallibility of logic, and in clinging to reason can become slaves to their emotions. science is born from fanaticism -- it is a gift.
so you suggest accepting aventurine's proposal to team up?
it's my job to keep tabs on people.
yeah. even though she has already decided to stop fighting with her father, they never managed to have a real conversation with each other.
that concludes our discussion. we will inform all participants of the result when a decision has been made. thank you all for coming.
quickly, over here, miss march. this is a "reverse mentorship gift" from me to you. i hope you put it to good use.
don't waste your time worrying about me aeur" this is my job. look out for yourself. after i've wiped the floor with them, i'll go find you all.
and, who knows, maybe i'll find my own magic along the way! all i can do is try, right?
unfortunately, we didn't achieve the outcome we wanted. but moments like this... make me feel like they never even left.
when ruan mei visited the luofu earlier, she mentioned what happened to you. this coincided with when the message sent by the astral express arrived.
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
the ten-lords commission will support your decision with everything we have, general.
miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
and one of them hasn't returned to me because she ventured too far. until now.
but what about those simply struggling for survival, fighting for something better? i've witnessed their light on the front lines, in the underworld in places you have overlooked.
it's a deal then. next time you need something done in the workshop, i'll do it for free!
that's too kind of you. my job involves ferrying business delegates to and from starskiff haven, so i do this kind of introduction all the time.
leave this to me. you should go meet up with neuvillette.
"what follows in these pages is the ordinary, everyday life of a regular person. nothing more, nothing less."
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
claiming to have family ties with the enemy sounds to me like an attempt at asking for mercy hoolay, are you begging me for mercy?
his invitation to debate this matter publicly was a chance for the more difficult business owners to hear from you directly.
hey, lay off, alright! my bluff is hanging from a thread here.
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
seriously? bring the whole crew, why don't you? tsk
then i'm afraid things might get unpleasant.
relaxing after work is actually pretty nice.
so then. the day's ahead of us. any ideas on how to spend it?
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
arlan, i understood the level of stress you're dealing with as soon as i saw this photo.
there is a certain place with a freezing-cold climate where there's nothing but ice as far as the eye can see.
my friends and i used to wander those streets thinking about where to find our next meal. that is, until chief oleg got me out and took me to the orphanage.
nothing looks out of place, and everything's spaced out just right.
later on, i gradually understood that master most likely didn't know any other way to raise a child. she was a marechaussee hunter, but i never heard her bring up her own parents.
as the fragmentum spreads underground, more monsters go roaming around causing trouble for all the towns. that means more vagrants in the mines.
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
i think i'll stay here for a bit longer. the show is still not quite over in my heart.
liyue is due another paper snowstorm. this time, you will be the one to change the prevailing weather.
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur
in adventuring, as in business, you always have to seize the opportunity while it's there.
we may be able to temporarily remove it with the orb?
that's the information i managed to piece together. bladie refused to tell me the details.
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents
i'm miss dunyarzad's bodyguard, here to see that she returns home safe and sound.
the arbor's rebirth has frightened the elders who lurk behind the scenes they fear the resurgence of abominations, much like what happened thirty years ago.
i hereby swear on my name and honor as a champion duelist that mister callas never intended to leave the ring alive.
i think we've all seen enough now, and we have ample witnesses to my flawless reasoning.
...first, don't you want to know my name?
and of course you would believe everything he reported. the only thing you know about me is that i'm a mercenary, but you've never seen me in action.
it's a shame, they still wouldn't give him a permit, even though he was born and raised in inazuma.
i just wish i could have done more. so many souls, and i could barely help. i'm so sorry
see you when i see you. and happy lantern rite.
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
thank you! if it's on the way, you can always pick up your fireworks from my house. everything was made in strict accordance with what was on the paper slip, you won't find the slightest thing wrong with them.
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
the gate won't budge in this time dimension how about recovering the "miracle" from the tome?
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
after all, your memory of me will soon dissipate like smoke.
i'm sorry i made you wait earlier. it was actually because i decided to swing by ororon's place to look for clues.
after some system hours, the words will turn into a common language that everyone can understand.
merchants from all over will set up shop. there'll be tons of stuff to eat, use, and wear more than you can count!
well? did you find the answer yet?
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
rise and shine! the two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift.
so concludes the words of her eminence, the tianquan.
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
a box in a box, that's how you know the gift is sincere!
leave this round to us! i got interrupted earlier, but now i have something to take my anger out on!
calm down, how many people do you think we'll be buying for?
there's no getting around these things if you wanna survive out there.
just recently, the akademiya lost something and there's a chance the item is connected with the dendro archon. this case might just somehow help you in meeting her.
there is no need to rush. take your time organizing your things. i will wait for you all here.
yeah, i had someone deliver letters to all of our guests, but maybe everyone is still busy with other things.
anyway, you should watch and learn, because i plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that divine priestess from watatsumi island.
sorry, ms. ying'er, something's come up. please let the others know i had to leave.
exactly. liyue is now a nation ruled by humans after all. it's about time we had the power to make a kite fly, don't you think?
you know the chief? then why don't i know you
i don't think he has quite grasped the nature of this situation.
i thought so too at the time. but later when grandpa took me around the zhuming's bakeries, we didn't find the same scent anywhere.
it's eric, right? here, you can have this.
yep, i guess you can put it that way. it takes strong convictions to be as dedicated as she is and shoulder that kind of responsibility.
but if it turns out that you have been deceptive in this matter, then not only will you be arrested immediately, but you'll also be charged with one more crime. do i make myself clear?
i'll give you a clue: she's currently in charge of the shogun's army, she visits the shrine at this time every month, and she is our guest today.
but you allowed argenti to take you away?
true. in his eyes, i'm just another ordinary person from mondstadt.
yes, it does. i always thought that she must have grasped some elusive, arcane wisdom to arrive at the conclusions she did.
miss march, to the untrained ear, these noises may sound the same. but for the craftsmen of the artisanship commission, every machine has a different pitch and melody.
but it just didn't work aeur" i was grief-stricken, like a huge part of my heart was suddenly missing
the fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise they would have been purged long ago.
what a small world
unfortunately, dan shu is dead, and even her corpse has crumbled into ash. that's one less clue we can pursue.
left, to the end of the corridor. i will wait there for you.
oleg and i took vache to the overworld. he made his final request to us: to take him outside the city to the snow plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
perhaps mister yang has heard -- there is a large boat called the "eventide" anchored along the sea of dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
thank you for your assistance, miss alley. by the way is miss robin doing fine? we are looking forward to her performance.
i haven't moved. what you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. they're all over the station. i just connect to one wherever i am needed.
we won't cause a serious diplomatic crisis by getting into some small scuffle with the fatui within our borders. you need not worry.
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
you mean the "serial disappearances of young women" case?
huh? i wouldn't go that far -- i only had dad to deal with. he could be fierce, but nothing like the monsters here.
after wandering around a bit, we finally bought a few dozen boxes of the zhuming's special salty-sweet pastries and ended up munching on them for several months.
erosion is a terrible thing. this body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve eternity.
though there's always something to do, with everyone lending a hand, i always feel at ease.
alright, the ball's back to you aeur" catch! i want to hear about your experiences and the people you've met.
by the way, have you seen bodies that might be the yaoqing messengers? one of them is a foxian wearing exquisite clothes, and the other wears a dark cloak, like a fugitive.
yes, i should take the opportunity to show you around while you're here.
come this way, i'll explain it to you.
but their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. for example
our uh our exchange only represents my personal views. if you wish it so, you can file a complaint to the ministry of civil affairs.
draw him back, using what i know about the instincts of spirits. as we all know, clairvoyance is usually conducted with the goal of unraveling mysteries.
peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while
well, i heard you have some experience with archery and martial arts. the first thing we're going to do is see just how strong your fundamentals are.
this is my fault. if only i'd perceived what they were feeling earlier, it never would have come to this.
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
but you need not emphasize your role as the honorary knight. you are a traveler from a distant land, and you can approach the aristocrats in this way.
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
i know. they always think they can push through the pain.
sorry, i said we could be friends, but i guess i'm not ready.
i'm not joking around, and i'm not making up some crazy story
certainly. pain is but common to a ninja and i shall never flinch in the face of it.
but being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. we must make a decision, no matter what.
the heavier the boat, the lower the hull sits in the water. so you can tell how heavily loaded a vessel is from the height of the waterline.
correct. such are the twists of destiny.
timmy, open the gate please. i want to see mister svarog.
well, give it some thought. i'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
i heard you got caught by the family? i gave you a clear clue "befriend a mute." simple and straightforward, you know?
it might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
for example, when greeting a friend, you could say: "as the morning dew greets the coming dawn, so do i greet you, my dear friend."
ha, that's something i do know. it's an aurumaton -- they're service robots on the xianzhou.
still, he's cooperating. he didn't turn down my offer to strike a deal. i'll make sure there are plenty of guards around to keep him safe from anything the fatui might be planning.
hehe, i won't be nervous anymore once i'm more familiar with this place.
everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. the greatest wish of the local pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the gilded hour.
what is all of this complaining about? you made a promise to my grandfather and now you want to run away? get out there, now!
"the family's protection for penacony has expired. any mishaps in the dreamscape could result in permanent brain death."
a classic tale of youth and friendship. it never gets old.
what represents the boundaries of mortal knowledge? many people think it's the genius society, but i think it's myself.
however, if a not-so-reasonable person insists on approaching, that's when the weapon racks come in handy.
please, lady keqing? this is really important to me
daring to send things despite knowing that i'm the heir to the sinners of mondstadt i'll remember this insult.
judges are instructed by the ten lords to carry out their orders, but no one ever explains their meaning to us
hmm, this bronya is really different from the bronya i remember.
it's probably an isolated glitch.
thanks to both your help, everything went smoother than i expected. and it looks like we still have some time to spare.
no, i won't let that happen.
oh, no, i was just thinking about how those nobles must be so cold-hearted. it's like they don't care about their people at all!
well, i--it's just the dust has settled now. the stellaron problem has been resolved, and cocolia
just don't let me down now, okay?
why so surprised? you're still young and full of energy. i'm pretty sure you'll live a few more decades. have some confidence in yourself!
we should make some tea, too. sipping tea, chatting, and just enjoying the time off, it's a great way to recharge.
of course i do, i've understood them for a while now. but as far as i can tell, she doesn't need other people's understanding. she needs to understand her own heart.
oh wow, it's already so late. everyone's probably running low on food and water aeur" it'll only get harder from here on out.
i guess once things settle down, i can spare a moment to contemplate the stars.
your run-of-the-mill robots don't have a will of their own. their aim is merely svarog's aim.
let's go. if my hunch is correct, we just might hit the jackpot this time.
(this is one of the marechaussee hunter keys that are passed down from generation to generation it looks just like the one master passed down to me.)
i think so. but it's hard to distinguish between reality and illusion here. i can't be sure.
i, uh i can't comment on that. i was just ordered to rescue the civilians actually, i have no idea either. anyway, you two just need to come with me.
a response that is certainly full of spirit, but lacking in sincerity a step will be recorded.
i promise you, vichama aeur" i will not abandon the ley lines to their fate.
so what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
so, thank you. truly.
wait a minute, now i'm a little confused. are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
come, let's pay a visit to the palais mermonia. the rest of you, head back to the rehearsal location for now, and wait for our good news.
how many more of your comrades are here? where were you planning to meet hoolay?
but if you still have doubts about ei, i would say they are misplaced.
an abandoned orphan, a cursed little girl, the last descendant of the puppet clan... i can tailor it to the tastes of the individual~
okay thanks, linlang. seems there's a little more to buying wineware than i first thought. we'll have to mull it over.
like, "let me send over 'tarou the goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
perhaps i put too much on your plate at once
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
heh, so you would stick to mister lyney's defense even after knowing what you do now? you certainly have more professionalism than i thought.
cirrus may come across as hot-headed and impulsive, but under the surface they are actually full of guile
it's a pleasure to meet you. you may call me lingsha. i have returned to serve as the head of the luofu's alchemy commission after completing my studies on the zhuming. if you are feeling unwell, i can arrange a healer for you at any time.
the knights of favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. i'm a bit ashamed of myself for it
this old man's words always catch me off guard.
there is no need to be so hostile.
i really hope the museum can open up soon the children here need a culturally-enriching environment -- especially those from the underworld
thank you all for hearing me out. we know very well why the adepti came here today but please forgive us, we cannot yield to your wishes.
careful, these traces are fresh. our unsought guest isn't far away.
i'll be rooting for you in the stands! don't go losing on me now!
it's bad -- really bad. their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
be it simple price negotiation or a full-blown trade war, momentum and bargaining chips are but minor factors. to win, you need to be first to find out what cards your opponent is holding.
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
bronya! i didn't know you'd stick up for us like that back there -- well said!
and who is this softly spoken little lady?
if you still don't believe me, then try asking these two men. they're also against the akademiya, but neither of them are as arrogant as you are.
fortunately, i made advance arrangements for gerald to remain in a safe location and conduct some basic physical training exercises.
but she was hanging out with some other rtawahist students, so we didn't get a chance with speak with her. are you gonna go and see where she's up to?
i think about this every time i listen to diviner fu talk. we are both from xianzhou, but are we really speaking the same language?
things are much more serious this time for two days now, huge clashes have been breaking out between the miners and the vagrants. it isn't pretty.
although these three items are rare, i trust that with your connections and capabilities, procuring them will not be a question of "if," but of "when."
thank you. i must apologize for the trouble my daughter has brought you.
know myself and know the enemy let's see, who should i ask first?
at this stage, let's revisit that scene from lyney's perspective.
why hello if it isn't the triumphant traveler. and why might you be visiting the shrine? a sign of piety, perhaps?
oh! the windblume ceremony is about to begin. windblume star, have you chosen your windblume?
belobog oh! i think lil gui mentioned it before, but i can't seem to remember. what kind of place is it?
apparently, they used to be good friends well, good friends who were bad for each other. bladie forgot nearly everything, so he doesn't remember it well.
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
also, if our clapper loader could avoid shouting at the start of the scene next time
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
i heard that the adventurers' guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.
you mean, the protection magic that stops them from coming to harm? we saw it in action.
but not to worry, it's just training after all. let's try again.
but if you were to choose the more trustworthy person between myself and keqing
"o weary yet free soul, even the most verdant leaf in the forest will pray for your happiness and safe passage."
you've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the sacred sakura and makoto's consciousness. but unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
oh? i guess you're pretty clever. but before you open the pouch, you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
possibly. they always think ahead.
vilmant? the one who's playing the role of the villain?
i give her the most boring things, and then she gives them back to me and they're suddenly interesting.
ahhhh well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
there's no need to use a vision in affairs that mora can solve. as far as affairs only a vision can solve go, i know of only one
while the lux arrow from the reignbow possesses unparalleled power to sever the ambrosial arbor, it can't sever mortals' desire to prolong their existence.
the same beauty is found in all forms of art. whether it's a dance or a gemstone, you use the same pair of eyes to admire it, right?
appearances can be deceiving. as i was examining the wall just now, i noticed there was something unusual about this stone.
so this mister norbert could well be the museum thief we're looking for?
you know better than i do. who watched the little songbird that couldn't sing perish right before their eyes? you did, blondie.
lady aglaea once said that your time is extremely valuable and shouldn't be wasted on unnecessary conflict.
what's her deal? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
however, starting tonight, i would advise you to stay at the international trade association.
when you say "protect," you're referring to their sanctimonious arrogance, aren't you?
don't worry about it, mister stream. it'll all be worth it when the tavern reopens and we finally have the chance to hear your marvelous singing voice.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
and the atmosphere here is completely different from the previous two scenes.
miss hu tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
we made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the lantern rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
hold on a moment. is this satisfying salad also something that amber ordered?
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
but when there are valid grounds, i will not only judge travelers from abroad
hey, fancy seeing you here.
um i guess you could slip away and find a safe spot to hide. i'll come back and get you once i've sent her on her way.
uh this morning? yeah, that's right. he's on urban patrol duty today, right? that's why he popped round and asked the favor.
tell me the truth sampo -- what are you gonna do about the overworld girl?
no way. as long as lynxy can protect herself, i'll be supportive in all her ventures!
as her erstwhile closest friend ei handed it over to me, and i've kept it in the grand narukami shrine ever since.
besides, i'm sure you won't be on watatsumi island forever. whatever titles we may have, we're friends first and foremost.
if being a workaholic were a disease, skott would be in the icu! it's okay to enjoy your work, but causing trouble in society is another story!
right, maybe someone deceived her with news about tail -- told her "she could only go alone." sounds like a trick some nasty kidnapper would use.
i'm sorry you didn't get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around i promise i'll make it up to you all next time.
well, don't start celebrating too early now. even if i have been carrying a curse like you said, how does that prove that i am merely a human being?
let's head back, otherwise mister svarog and pascal will get worried.
it sounds like you had an eventful trip don't worry, i'm sure ganyu will fill me in on all the details shortly.
still, i take the fact that so many people are turning to us for assistance as a sign that the tenryou commission is gradually regaining the people's trust.
i don't know who the "mother" that you're referring to is, but
i i'm honored to have been able to take part in this plan! i hope you liked the dance i dedicated to you!
pom-pom looks really cute when they walk
plus, he was on guard. he knew i would try to go after him, so he made sure to keep his distance. i kept an eye out for a good opportunity, but it never came.
so you and delavar have been partners all along.
to put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. to put it more bluntly, there are things that even the seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
what about all the unresolved emotions of the parties involved? what happens to them?
me? oh, well, i bought some tea, of course. i just had to try all the varieties recommended in the steambird.
yeah, they said that i could go as long as i left the goods with them. otherwise, they'd stuff me into my delivery box and toss me into the sea to drown
well, that's because
just some colleagues. think of this as a business competition or a personal grudge
that's right. even at this price, there is no shortage of people willing to pay for a lunch opportunity with me.
and as for you try to stick around the city until we get back. you don't want us to call the folks from the corps and have them drag you back to the city.
haha, that won't be necessary -- i can't imagine march reacting well if her camera went missing. besides
forty% sixty-five% eighty-five%
come to think of it, i didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
i won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
alright. seems like the problem inside has been suppressed.
huh? sounds like maternity leave knocked the wind out of your sails! feeling rusty?
i told him that it was best not to speak too soon aeur" there's no guarantee that wriothesley will make a personal appearance.
if it were anyone else, i'd have to refuse but even the almighty shogun has recognized your abilities, traveler. i'm happy to assign this task to you.
the reason being that she lost to me. and when i say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. it was quite a humiliating defeat.
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
robots aligned against humans? i've never heard of such a thing. machines should obey humans unconditionally
in my line of work, combat skills are essential.
uh, what decision? you're gonna have to be more specific.
i'm afraid it won't be wise for us to continue our investigations together, mister boothill.
even though i am utterly unlike makoto, and can never become the person she was, i still need to do the things that she would have done.
is this binary arithmetic? could it be droidhead?
in my imagination, these lifeforms would be a new variety that are born as geniuses. i planned to name them after lambda, member #eight of the genius society
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here i believe it's about penacony's past.
where is mister shamari right now? i'd like to meet him.
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details well that's reassuring.
let's go, benefactors, time is of the essence. we must be close.
thank you for inviting me out. this trip has been quite eye-opening for me.
sky minks fly so nimbly and are so alert that even the quickest of hands will have a hard time catching them.
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
such privileges exist due to the yashiro commission's role in managing ceremonial affairs. oftentimes, it is not appropriate to discuss details in front of bystanders.
remember when i mentioned that the cloud knights blocked all relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing happened? stargazer navalia is not under lockdown.
are you going to help this um, clockie that only you can see?
she'll figure out what's best for her soon enough. oh aeur" and if you'd like to see lyney after the show you know where he'll be. the usual haunt.
i didn't find any components, but i got this i don't know if we can still eat it
the old me? i used to be a devil hunter.
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
mister zubayr, we're trying to put together a list of arguments that might be useful. any ideas?
wait, whaeur"why are you all looking at me? you're not seriously expecting me to fight, are you!?
i've tried talking to her, but you know how she is she uses her wit to talk circles around anyone
do make the most of your trip here, won't you? quite a lot has changed.
your ship can leave whenever you want, but i'm afraid i can't say the same for the cargo.
didn't you just say that you were freezing? drink it and it'll help warm you up.
i, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. so, i will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
please excuse the interruption.
surely you don't think all that was "business development"!?
i looked everywhere and i found some clues regarding the treasure hoarders. besides wagon tracks, i also came across bits and pieces of fireworks packaging scattered on the road.
however, i feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so i used the identity of the shogun.
may everyone accept you as one of our own, and may the forest of blessings be a place you can call home.
understood, miss march. i promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
i'll send an "invitation" to the preceptors.
so i won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. what matters is that i tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
people use fireworks to remember their most precious memories, and these memories sparkle and shine each time the fireworks fly.
in your opinion, was the ministry of civil affairs' appraisal of mingbo at all exaggerated?
there seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. to put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
although i've made quite a few "mutually assured destruction" buttons, it's not like i'm going to blow up everything i see
everything should be fine as long as that oni manages to avoid causing a scene.
then why didn't mister callas explain himself in court? if he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
an outstanding piece of musical work is just like a mirror. only through comparison and reflection can shortcomings be found in time.
perhaps this was another sealed location, but an undocumented one what could be in here?
i mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons
back then, i didn't even dare to dream about having someone to confide in.
you've arrived. ah, who's this?
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
she is indeed reckless, but she is also passionate and eager. don't underestimate her. youth can accomplish a lot simply by relying on such energy.
they were different from most but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in liyue.
even so, keep your spirits up and try to be happy, okay? and try to smile more every day, just like i'm doing now.
alright, i'll wait for you here. make it quick, though. i can tell you some other stories when you return.
in that case, let's chat some more! i'm not in a rush, anyway.
anyway, if you must know, the divination commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination.
give it a little push and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
i hate to say it, but if you can teach me that move, i'll maybe admit that you're just a tiny little bit stronger than me
and no guardians of liyue chess set would be complete without you, would it?
you bet i do. we go way back. he's easy to talk to. watch me persuade him.
you'll do fine. i heard you're good with bandages. you can patch up a wound, can't you?
though your power was weak, i was still able to find you. you were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
what, still something you want to talk about? alright, let's make it quick.
you have a strong sense of belonging here i guess i'm the opposite. mercs are stray dogs wherever they go.
i asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. no one asked you to criticize my dear old mettle!
we've been disconnected from the rest of the universe for far too long, but i really believe the festival could be our chance to reconnect with other worlds again. it's important as a host that i make all guests feel welcome.
but if the treasure was all you cared about, why plant all those explosives? wouldn't they just destroy the treasure, and bury you along with it?
if i do not want a secret revealed, the most foolproof way is to destroy it. the anti-truth serum will make you forget the brief period we spent together.
you're welcome. just keep it, that's all i ask.
come with me. let's find a quiet place. there's something i want to talk about with you.
who? oh, that young lady who loves to prank. i'll remember her name when she finally understands the game that adults play.
if the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. i wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking
i understand -- i'm scared too! i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
at least, that's my theory. still, that doesn't explain why pascal is being treated as a fragmentum creature
response to a question with another question indicates intense suspicion and resistance a step will be recorded.
the people of belobog hold both of you in high regard. they'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
were the contents light? no larger than the size of an envelope?
also, why is this high wall here? and can a wall really block sandstorms?
oh, i love hero stories! tell me more when you have time!
oh my, i didn't know you had dreams of stardom, dan heng.
divine punishment has never been fair. as okhema's guardian, i must do the same.
belobog has a heating system of its own. however, maintaining a steady indoor temperature has always been a challenge, no matter if it's qlipoth fort or the boulder town clinic.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
haha, that was actually a very good impression of cloud retainer, paimon.
you could give him mint plants that you plucked from the side of the road, and he wouldn't even mind.
there are lots of goods around here. let's search the area, maybe we'll be able to find something.
those unhappy experiences allowed you to really cherish your bonds with everyone, and also gave you the opportunity to become friends with us.
that's the one. actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. it's a spell to help calm the ley line memories.
well, it's part of my responsibilities as the cauldron master. so, where would you like to start, general?
then the sages would have had to reproduce every mark i left during previous training sessions.
though it is heartbreaking to lose a kindred spirit, life goes on because there are new friends waiting for you further down the road.
what a whirlwind of a story! i felt like i was holding my breath the whole time.
us mercs, on the other hand we pretty much live from one day to the next.
my bow sounds in peak condition. one shot is all i need.
after their coming of age ceremonies, a lot of them aspired to join the ipc to make it big.
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
no need to thank me. as long as you like them.
good thing it rained today aeur" it means they'll leave footprints i doubt they'd give themselves away that easily, but let's follow them and try our luck.
when people want fireworks, it's always because they have something to commemorate. and if they miss the chance, they might never get another one. so, no matter how busy i am, i'm always happy to take their orders.
if you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. there are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
alright, i'll help you out -- the first and last time the landau siblings will work together!
in accordance with my wishes, the shogun did her best to create an eternal nation. a nation that, in theory, should remain entirely unchanged over time.
however, unlike you stellaron hunters or the astral express, we band together merely to obtain what we want.
in the meantime, i'll follow up on the exhibit theft case. i wonder if any new clues were found over in svarog's domain
you've clearly heard a lot of folk tales, but that's not the kind of "cursed sword" i'm talking about.
i'll leave the reassurance of the researchers in your hands.
what's that look on your face? i thought i made good time on the way back.
furthermore, i had even predicted at the time that i may wish to modify the shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. however, such changes would not be conducive to eternity.
--seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. with you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
asta provided financial assistance to a few exceptional children -- i assume arlan was one of them.
i concur with you. ninja hiryu is a punctilious ninja indeed.
and these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
i sent over some evidence regarding the prison break in the shackling prison. i trust you've already looked it over.
simple: you just gotta stand at the byline and give your team tactical instructions.
in my recently issued post-war temporary decree, i included restrictions on the prices of essential everyday goods. these items will ultimately reach the people at a reasonable price.
but with such a large group, it's inevitable that troublemakers will find their way in. they've been stealing from the miners and picking fights. and that's not the worst of it.
i figured we would come check out the situation either way. why not let her keep some privacy.
hence, we must be prepared. when our task is to craft the armor for the deliverer, what harm is there if you and i don humble attire?
the construction of the new jade chamber is now officially complete. once the tethers are released, it will soar into the sky.
hahaha, curious we've only just met, and you've already given me three causes for vengeance. it's been a while since i've encountered anyone as interesting as you.
no, if it were only about revenge, they could just wreck the ship and destroy all the cargo, instead of allowing it to end up in the shackling prison.
can you stop conflating the show on stage with your real-life relationships in the troupe?
a loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. she is worthy to be called a hero. with an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the kujou clan is assured.
but the president wants what's best for aurum alley too, and yet we still disagree with him.
and though i can still see that hill clearly in my memories, now it's been completely submerged.
i felt like i was neglecting you guys, so i wanted to find an opportunity to catch up.
since my physical form is here in this realm, i suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.
i've instructed yanming to sort through tingyun's belongings. i hope you can pick some out to place around the starskiff.
it was a deliberate display to showcase the dangerous nature of the "cargo" in broad daylight. this way, the cargo would end up in the shackling prison, serving as a tool for the prison break.
this is herta space station. as you might tell from its name, it belongs to the distinguished madam herta herself.
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
and so, the monsters were eradicated, and the sorcerer was defeated.
i'll lead the way. you two keep an eye on our surroundings.
"life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
"at the end of your journey, all that perplexes you and troubles you will resolve."
it's a tiny robot? is it searching for something? but i don't remember mister svarog issuing an order like this recently
we mustn't fail her determination. i'm not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.
not now, lord mydei. i'll tell you everything once we return to okhema.
don't underestimate my ability to exact revenge. hah! sara won't get the upper hand this time!
i understand your concerns, but i'm sorry. i just don't have anything to tell you.
this is not something that an honorary knight can accomplish alone. i will mobilize the rest of the knights to assist.
ningguang is good to work with. but i have to be mindful of our identities when i'm out in public. when i meet a qixing as an employee of the ministry of civil affairs, they're "sir" or "lady" to me.
hee-hee, stop it hanshirou, you'll embarrass me!
if these infiltrators rely on the medicine to maintain their disguise, then following this lead in our investigation seems prudent. please follow me.
it's a secret -- and it's a good thing i got here so fast, otherwise you would have missed the fireworks i prepared.
welcome back. i trust beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
before we do anything else, let's head back to liyue harbor. i need to fetch something.
i'm convinced that what the witnesses saw was actually the fatui coercing him, or perhaps trying to extract information.
the stairs were nothing! a little while ago, we discovered that the tree above the stage had a huge chunk of bark ready to fall off. mister zubayr was worried sick!
well, life and death, jiaoqiu, it's all predetermined.
*sigh* i wanted to keep it with me but that's the problem with old things -- the less you use them, the easier they break. besides, no one's paying me to fix it, right?
leaving it up to fate? it's just how that gambler thinks.
i guess i still get fired up by that feeling of going all-out in a fight it made me realize that i'm still a mercenary through and through.
the old and broken weapons
still i will give them a little more time. after all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
besides, i genuinely like the job of an intelligence officer -- for me, using my brain is a lot more fun than traveling.
but before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
that pink-haired fox tried to say something. i'm pretty sure he sensed something fishy. since he's not familiar with this place, he just dropped us a hint, but you didn't seem to be paying attention at all.
the boar's not a bad character, actually. he's the one who raises the little oceanid, yes?
the two nameless have been honest in their answers. even though there are some tricky details, my intuition tells me there is nothing wrong.
these cloud knights aren't mara-struck what did you do to them?
ms. yun, i've already heard something about the reason for your involvement. you are looking for a venue for your new opera, aren't you?
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan
i wasn't scared by anything but on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
before he left, mister sharif looked like he had a lot on his mind.
but general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
it's not right! so, when i learned the ceremony had failed, i was ashamed by my inaction and absolutely relieved by the result.
ms. rekhar can't go on adventures anymore, but she has found a stable career and a new life at the theater.
if you don't want anyone else to know, we'll definitely keep it a secret!
this is your plane of euthymia. it's your inner world.
i've heard his name. a genius boy, and working every day at such a young age? sounds exhausting.
not yet. there's something else we need to deal with.
no problem! the rules are actually quite simple. to start with, i've made some minor tweaks to the snowshine lamps, making it possible for heat to be transferred between them
huh? is his past really that dark?
besides, this has only come about because i failed to make a timely decision. this issue started with me, and i shall be the one to finish it.
sure is, i've already started placing bets.
"if you become human you can reveal your secret to no one. you will face suffering and loneliness. is this truly what you want?"
if we really want to do this right though, it's the thought behind the gift that truly matters. the more thought goes into the gift, the better the recipient feels it.
i have a very effective way of training for this. come with me to dragonspine.
yes she is a high-ranking member of the ipc, after all. she knows how to use words to her advantage.
nice to meet you, klee. i'm yoimiya, and i run naganohara fireworks.
and to make things worse, another group of visitors just entered the depths of the shackling prison, the messengers from the xianzhou yaoqing.
the discomfort i was experiencing earlier was caused by the shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
but you cannot run from combat, dan heng. your spearmanship is identical to imbibitor lunae's.
is following girls around like a lost puppy your way of getting their attention? you've been doing this for nearly half a system hour.
the iridescence tour is relatively unknown in liyue. it's difficult to predict how a brand-new show will be received.
that's exactly why my people turned to "vessels" like ororon.
i must leave now. listen: don't worry. someone will come and find you very soon, just go with them. you won't remember a thing except me.
after that, no one came to the theater to scold me, either. we actually gained many new customers and, they were all akademiya students.
hmm, now that i think about it, her opponent in the finals will be a tough one to beat.
your question was written all over your face. now look, you've helped me rebuild the jade chamber, and i intend to repay you handsomely for it.
how's the journey been? if there's something weighing you down, let me do a little divination for you
my body feels strange
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
i see has mister svarog ever witnessed a similar incident anywhere in the network?
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
rest assured, cocolia may have changed over the years but she'd never hurt bronya. i'm certain of that.
by making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
she's actually a very reasonable old girl in private.
oh? so now that "survival" won't convince us, you want to talk about "interests"?
so be it. the sensation is not a disagreeable one.
sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the akademiya without any effort
garden of recollection is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
when the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
someone as perceptive and wise as ping will surely have come to understand and embrace this.
not that i'm doubting your skill, but i'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself in the process.
see those marks on the dummy? those are the result of several days' worth of practice.
have you talked with these disciples, benefactor? what do you make of them?
i'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale do share it with me, won't you? i couldn't bear to miss out.
tonight seems to have gone off without a hitch. i'm so glad it's all going smoothly.
the power to grant wishes but only within the confines of the bottle.
it won't be a problem. the fontaine-style dress from the novel shouldn't be too heavy, so it won't affect my abilities.
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
the murky mirror reflects the view of inazuma in a bygone age. spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
maybe there's more to it? it's not like i would know, i'm a mere amicassador.
suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
so, you seem to be under the impression that i am able to offer some sort of help? who gave you that idea?
no fluctuations detected. a step will not be recorded.
i could tell that although neither of us acknowledged it, we both knew that the road ahead would likely end in tragedy.
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
he even offered to deliver my gifts to the fortress of meropide for me once he's done with the day's work.
so, this guy is the source of it all, right? if we take him out, the fragmentum activity in this area should subside for a while
demolition notices need to be provided in writing and made available to the public. otherwise, the theater can continue to operate as long as its license is valid.
take your time. enjoy the meal and calm yourself.
try to focus on that flower
i was worried i might embarrass myself in front of you. i even rehearsed every word beforehand.
yancui has agreed to offer you free meals throughout the crossover.
march seventh and i could already tell. it's clear that every cloud knight soldier we've met on the skysplitter is an elite warrior.
luckily, it looks like choosing the tianshu's successor is suddenly not such a pressing issue after all.
you do have some skill, but now is not a good time to try to stop me.
you needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. leave them to beidou aeur" she is well versed in handling treasure hoarders. i will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
something is wrong. the guards aren't responding
dunn dunn? ha, why didn't you say so! no problem. we'll be back in a bit.
thank you again for your help this entire time.
unfortunately for them, i'm one of the best trackers in the business. they're not about to get away with their little scheme on my watch.
ah yes, i remember the invitation. i need to make sure i'm well-prepared for this.
alhaitham, do you stand by everything you just said?
the awkward silence and weird expressions left quite the impression on 'em. they were originally interested in joining us, but after that, they both told me they were too uncomfortable to stick around.
i invited you here to gain a better understanding of the express, not bore you with these trivialities.
come on, i don't need that kind of attention. xavier can accept the reward on our behalf.
besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! anyway, give it some thought.
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
it was inevitable that their business would send them all to different corners of the world, and that they'd have far less opportunity to see each other in the future.
we are putting our dearest baby sister in your hands this time. let us know immediately if anything happens.
though we're just tiny people compared to the divine, we still have to do our best to make sure that the birthday girl feels loved on her special day.
seems like not even those craftsmen know where the arsenal is at this rate, we won't find anything, and grandpa might take me away before i can do anything
mm, i'm sure.
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
it's the same with gepard. i could tell it took a lot for him to lay down his arms.
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
but your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
it's just two hundred but i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
looking at these contestants, i suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason
i have faith in you. however, before we depart, there is one more thing i must tell you.
but it's dangerous around here. we'd better travel together.
if hoolay does come to attack the skysplitter lieutenant yanqing, i need you to hold him there until i am able to arrive.
as for now, i'm temporarily suspending the activities of the ghost-hunting squad.
haha, we'll see. i just hope the tingyun in your memories won't be tainted by phantylia anymore.
the number of times that the thread trembles is the number of steps forward that the executioner will take.
the soldiers stationed here must have moved these into a roadblock.
i told you, i was only just transferred here from the yaoqing. i don't come here very often.
siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. according to some very tall tales, they're believed to be al-ahmar's blessings.
our identities are like masks. when we switch between them, we change the way the world perceives us.
but it turned out you had come to rescue me you came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
i don't know how much you're willing to believe me but ororon really is a good kid. i see no reason why he'd suddenly get involved with the fatui.
countless people exist in my memories, and i know one day, that will be my fate, too aeur" a memory living on in someone else's head.
it's unfortunate -- the six-phased ice that once enveloped her carries its own mysteries, and miss march has amnesia about her own past
but it was much earlier than that.
wait a minute, was that gepard's plan all along? use guilt to make me stay!?
seeing your serious expression, the man's brow begins to furrow.
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
that was the mission my grandfather entrusted to me. you just relax and keep guard over the ring.
in short, everyone needs a reason to stay. i hope you can find yours soon.
the moment you stepped into the memory zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. i can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
there's no better place for looking out into the stars than the express. i envy you guys.
it seems like someone has been awaiting us. ready to step into the spotlight now?
i've got a spice-trading deal from another nation i thought maybe delavar and his friends might be interested. know where i could find him?
it really does have a tracking function let's see how useful it is.
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
according to the plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if they've discovered anything.
yes initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
my family has pretty good connections with the yashiro commission. we work very closely with them. and whenever there's a national event of any sort, the other two commissions come to us, too.
it's okay. i promised you i'd help find your grandpa, so i'll do whatever it takes.
that's fine. we can try a different approach. you'll be glad to know that bath sprites have mastered the art of catering to the needs of others.
perhaps i'm just not used to such a peaceful vista. if the luofu's skies can become as calm as this, maybe i'll eventually get used to it.
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
hmm i don't know how to deal with people like that.
so i guess now, the kids' impression of the great mujina youkai is mostly influenced by me.
in addition to her secretarial duties, eris is also a student at the belobog college of art. she's very knowledgeable about the museum's exhibits and their history.
sorry, that's what the rules say
i'll arrange for someone to send you home which reminds me, you seem to have some dependable friends with close ties to you.
yes. though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the ley lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
actually, seeing as there's no one around can i ask you some things?
it seems someone from beyond the wall must have been supporting this.
tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me? with a one-on-one duel? or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
so you're also saying the guards want to work with wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
your performance tonight will almost certainly attract their attention.
qingni! have you thanked your benefactors yet?
what she said was this aeur" "make sure to get along, you two. if you really can't agree on something, just settle it with a fight. whoever loses is the real pet."
then close your eyes, and make a wish to the goddess of fate. we will help make your wish come true.
the hint for the final question was a little too obvious.
ah, i see. well, that can be fixed. i'll just have the yashiro commission order a few hundred cups and go door-to-door delivering them.
as a passing traveler here, it's not my place to comment on their disputes
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague
heh, if you think you can just take this sword from my hand, go ahead and try.
in that case, maybe you'll be able to explain everything in detail for us now?
art doesn't discriminate, and it appeals to all. everyone has the right to appreciate art.
something like that, yeah.
it's pretty much the same situation here. neither party is willing to compromise.
so. from what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
next time you try to bluff like that, at least make it convincing.
the monsters of the fragmentum don't need any materials we humans use. and if they did take anything, this place would look much messier
even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. there are countless things that humans cannot change.
haha, i have to admit, you definitely have that rock 'n' roll flair.
not only do they not smile, they are also bitter, grumpy, and weep in sorrow all the time.
a regular customer? you?
i've heard that the crew's senior members are extremely skilled. dan heng is already the express' guard, and the conductor the conductor is too cute to ask to train!
yeah, but this time the situation's different.
hmph. then i will come again once your preparation is complete. i have time.
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
by "salvage," i mean to slowly get close to those memories, and then exert my memokeeper power to retrieve them.
but that does bring me to a question i've been mulling over in my head do you think there's something else going on in her life?
so, are you both ready?
the duty of a tengu warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the kujou clan is to guard inazuma. these two are of the same ilk.
close your eyes and hold your breath. sever all other sounds and let my whispers fill your ears.
it's just i thought that silvermane guards were all cold and unfeeling -- they left the underworld to perish. but she doesn't give me that impression.
i can't bear to think how painful and lonely her final days must have been
there. now do you see what i mean, mister yang?
the night market sells grilled insects! wanna give them a try?
very well, it was indeed just as you said.
i have been gathering the funds necessary to build it from the time i began learning the merchant's craft. and since becoming the tianquan, i have spared no effort in hiring the best craftsmen to constantly extend it
i was just out on a shopping trip. i ran out of macaroni, so i went to grab a few more bags.
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. i'm natasha -- a doctor in the underground. you've already spent a day in my clinic.
lady tianquan, the gate of initiation is now ready. we are good to go.
come and have a walk with me. a stroll is the most appropriate post-dessert activity.
i make tea for everyone whenever lyney receives a guest.
but, the gate didn't move an inch
but won't you have regrets if things just come to an abrupt end? it'd be like when you were forced to stop adventuring
dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? after all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of teyvat.
my cousin has quite a collection of books about sumeru desert mythology on his shelves. i highly suspect that he, too, is looking for that domain.
not bad. the courtyard furnishings are very nice, and the scenery in the distance is really one of a kind.
but i've already told you.
your technique was all over the place, and you relied too much on speed. is this really all the cloud knights of the luofu can muster? so disappointing.
what? how is that possible? i need a moment to wrap my head around this
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
third mirror! stop that nightmarish cackle. it's giving me goosebumps.
hmm want to make some flower pots?
sorry, i can't answer that question. that ranger is shrouded in mystery. i'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
though blind, furuyama is unparalleled in his ability to appraise tea. he brews some of the very finest tea in all of inazuma.
urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
since when did the masked fools suddenly start respecting agreements?
i quickly learned that every card back with that particular design had been scooped up overnight. there's not a single one left in all of liyue.
i'm just a little curious. isn't it really tiring for miss sparkle to play so many different roles?
mm-hmm mm-hmm alright
for a human soul, to lose the boundaries of the mind is to drown in the sea of consciousness without a concept of self
thank you for enlightening me. was it for the same reason that you "traded off" my mentor to the xianzhou zhuming, only to stand idle and allow the resurgence of the disciples of sanctus medicus?
alright, you'll be safe here. my workshop has pretty good soundproofing, and barely anyone comes in.
i just want to find a happy corner in the universe and drift wherever the wind blows. if it's not fun anymore, i'll find a way to make it fun!
thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
maybe i am, maybe i'm not. but hey, if i do become tianshu, i'll look out for you guys.
we still have a chance, though. to make it happen... please, black swan, guide us to those with a strong will.
since the battle, the shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
in the past, poets from liyue used kites to symbolize a feeling of longing or evoke the peacefulness of idyllic rural scenery.
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia
i hear master xingqiu is writing a book? standard novella, or a ghost story? i think i should go tell him about all the things i run into aeur" that'd make for a really good read!
no, it's fine. let them sit for a while.
i've already informed the police station. there'll be someone to take you into the warehouse, so you may head there directly.
sure. you can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.
still remember what i taught you? feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then get close to it.
um, where did albedo and razor go?
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
i didn't mean it that way. since you've already drawn your swords, you'd be disappointed if you didn't get to test one another, right?
elio ordered sam and i to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
that there once existed a childish and foolish jerk with a heart of gold.
the path to hell is paved with heavenly treasure; devils trying to fool you, better get your head together. the hunters hide greed with a welcoming smile; don't be beguiled, it could be your last mile.
be careful when you draw your swords, and make sure you don't hurt each other.
well, right now, i'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
i'll find some time to accompany you to shop for a clock, lest you oversleep and miss something important.
you willingly took this work on, knowing that it would be tedious, and you have worked diligently. my secretaries and i are very grateful to you.
huh? what's wrong with that? everyone around here knows the way i work
my thinking was that only people who pre-order the chess set at full price will be eligible to receive the limited-edition traveler chess piece.
you are guests from afar -- there is no reason for this matter to concern you am i making myself clear?
not much. we just chatted a bit.
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though
i know, right? thanks to march seventh skipping class, we get to join in on the fun.
are you alright? you've suddenly gone quiet. it's not like you at all.
see the markings on the wall over there? all you need to do is use the jade abacus's image recorder to capture all of them, and you'll be able to reach this zone's contender
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
grandpa said to never be stingy when it comes to making friends. so, how big is your appetite?
i've been in liyue harbor for so long now that i'm just not as familiar with the adepti anymore. if there's anything we want to know about them, she's the best person to ask.
as the countdown began, he entered the tunnel.
right, the same as what mister khasani believes.
we have already considered every possible way of resolving our differences, but it seems the descendants of the aristocracy remain antagonistic towards the knights
care for a game of liyue millennial? it'll give me an opportunity to see exactly how good you are as a player.
whatever the case, i think i know what everyone is getting at. i'll do my best to improve.
my, my you look like a small injured animal. are you still willing to talk to me? of course i'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
no ifs, no buts. we've recovered the goods. as agreed, this is sufficient to establish his innocence.
i had a patient who took some before a fight, only to realize that afterwards his lower body was missing
a chat? is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
what i saw surprised me a good number of the architects in belobog believe that qlipoth is the one and only aeon it's clear that their conclusion was limited and lacking in perspective.
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
ah c'mon, no need to get all serious. just buy a round of drinks next time we're all in the city, or something.
i can't speak for everyone, but this is how i really feel.
i am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.
yeah, exactly. he's young and talented.
you should not mention this name it has been a forbidden word for a long time.
the weather is dreadful, the fog is thick, and visibility is low. just like lisa said.
yes. she is the memokeeper i mentioned.
let's begin with your manner of speech. aristocrats have a very unique way of carrying conversation, even with mundane daily topics.
hah, you guys sure have a lot to say about that broken heater.
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
still, who knows how this space is planning on revealing the answer to us.
the general is a true master of maximizing returns for minimal effort. i cannot match him on that front.
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
as the newly appointed cauldron master, there's been much to take care of within the alchemy commission. it's only now that i've had the chance to speak with you. please forgive the delay, elder.
looks like nothing can be found here.
master was a fascinating individual, if inexperienced in the ways of raising children.
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you for now.
so that's it even the villains in opera performances rarely go that far
however, the three questions i posed earlier were not just for the nameless, but for you too, general jing yuan.
if i make an exception to the rule now, i'm just leaving a backdoor for myself. which would be the same as not having a boundary in the first place.
don't let her carefree nature fool you -- she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
oh, has night fallen already? then you'd best go have a rest.
tell me this. why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? why now?
topaz shared with me the story of the stellaron's descent upon jarilo-vi -- how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
bravo, good show! you certainly live up to your reputation.
if i win, we might be able to overturn things and change their minds.
if you have any more questions, just ask uncle tian. after the recent turn of events i'd say he owes you one, wouldn't you?
hand over hoolay's remains to the xianzhou yaoqing, and i'll handle the explanations to the alliance.
don't make excuses for her.
so close and yet so far you'll have to pick up the pace.
after all, you saw makoto in there, didn't you?
as a matter of fact there is something i've been planning for a while now.
as i've said all along, there's much more to idyia than she gives herself credit for. she has a very special power though i think some of us have sensed that already.
hey march! don't forget to take a picture of the stellaron for me.
if what wallace said is right, then norbert must have been missing for several days already. there must be someone who knows where he is.
thank you. it's a lot to handle, but i'm sure you can manage.
did they really think that as long as they didn't do any of that stuff right in front of me, i would never know?
okay, we're done with chapter one. let's move on to chapter two.
i've never had such a dream before. in most dreams, i just go from one mask to another
for us to meet now is premature. nevertheless, you set foot on these islands at precisely the right moment.
next up let's interview those two over there.
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
this guitar was one of those inventions. cocolia came up with a name
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
alright, i gotta cheer up! i can't waste everyone's words of encouragement!
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
yes. glad to make your acquaintance, mister morris. we've heard about the issues you've encountered with your financial situation, and genuinely hope that things have taken a turn for the better.
and yet she didn't come to any of us for help. that's not like her.
hmm? what is this stall doing here? maybe it's for participants who need a break?
let's meet again. what an interesting bunch you are.
looks like she's done with her questions
so, there is a dish that tastes even better than onigiri? then i shall be sure to remember its name.
if i'm not mistaken, the two of you just rushed over here from the history and culture museum? i appreciate your coming here on such short notice.
i admit, seele is talented. we do work well together. but that's all there is to it.
this is a new type of firework which has been modified by the ministry of civil affairs. i've heard that you are fond of gadgets, so i've brought one for your amusement.
i believe everyone here is familiar with the general contents of the proposal. after this round of financing, the ipc is expected to hold thirty% of penacony's shares.
rules, societal dos and don'ts, all these made-up human moral codes -- i've given it my all, but i just can't seem to shirk them!
i understand. i'm counting on you!
(is he talking about how no one in the capital seems to remember the hunters and their legacy? i didn't expect the script to contain this level of social criticism)
maybe you'll make a successful intelligence agent yourself one day. i'm excited to go up against you.
looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. and he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
i am focalors. the eyes of countless fontainians are upon me. i must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
oh that i was obviously joking.
hehe. don't forget we have a lunch later. save some space, or you might miss out on some even better food.
hm it's a place too cold to bear, covered in snow and ice. the guys doing the scientific research don't have time to worry about the surroundings.
pengyi, is everything clear? please remember the tasks i've given you.
i'm just here to talk business. so, are you in business or not?
since you've got everything ready i say, let grill master dehya take it from here.
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
oh? you look fine to me. sorry, i need to prioritize the wounded. there have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days -- many people are injured.
recently, i learned something new calculation results can't always bring people happiness.
but you needn't worry, at least, not whilst we're investigating this matter. i'm sure you're familiar with the phrase: "a man of moral integrity fears no slanderous attack."
my lady, please prepare yourself for what we're going to tell you next. it concerns the master
if we walk through here, we'll be able to see the wardance's official venue.
you wanna hear a story? alright, alright. sit here, and i shall tell you the story i'm most proud of aeur" the story of the naganohara family! you'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?
remember what i said? you sigonians are better off hiding in the sewers
but after thinking it over, the only thing that could be considered equal value is the bond i have with all of you.
hey diluc, i heard that the fatui have recently proclaimed you "persona non grata."
wait, hold up, where are you going? don't leave!
haha, i wanna see the stellaron too, y'know -- it was my research topic for over a decade. you don't get that many decades in life.
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
lamentable my ninja speed isn't fast enough to outrun cause and effect.
is this order really correct? lemme see
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
every once in a while, i'll need them to get me things from other planets, and they often come to me to help them solve problems.
moving containers, picking locks seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
that's my opinion, anyway. think about it, only people who have high standards for themselves would worry about failing to meet others' expectations.
anyway, sorry to get off topic, we're in a bit of a hurry! mister jut, did you say you didn't reserve enough food?
oh, uh not to brag or anything! maybe it's hard to believe. just just pretend i never said anything.
i would like to continue walking through the forest for a while. will you accompany me?
this may be an everyday occurrence for you. but for me, this trip has been quite an occasion.
it appears our otherworldly friend requires some enlightenment. how about this -- the match is starting in an hour. i'll give you some real-life tactical pointers in the ring!
hi, we meet again what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
after who knows how long, he mastered all the knowledge he could comprehend.
in fact, despite being referred to as a city, mondstadt is a nation.
pascal could you please, uh explain why you were stealing parts?
mm, feels like a good angle.
the captain is taken aback by your sudden question. still, his shock only lends credence to your theory.
of course, if you want to get to the nitty-gritty, it's not that simple this project has encountered plenty of hiccups along the way. it wasn't all smooth sailing.
i need to borrow a ceremonial sword, and make some other preparations. it'll take me about two days.
the tenryou commission if only they weren't so overzealous, there might be a way
did he succeed?
it's my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.
but only someone from the six commissions could bring the stellaron into the xianzhou undetected, let alone plant it within the ambrosial arbor
this isn't right. please let him go.
topaz has something else to take care of, you'll be seeing her later. talks can still continue between the two of us.
the wheels are completely broken, but the connecting component should be pretty much okay. let's remove it.
huh? why don't you respond? according to the custom, i must wait until you kneel completely before i can say the next words.
don't tell me this one is broken too!?
all letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? as long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded
i understand your concern. i'll be sure to give it further consideration.
unsheathe your swords and show me what you've got, march!
precisely. now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the hydro archon, i order your arrest.
haha i was just joking. i've been waiting for you.
everyone who owns this chess set will preserve this moment in history in a vivid and compelling form.
why is this place so full of junk? are you the kind of people who never throw away the box when you buy something, 'cause you're worried you won't be able to return it without the original packaging?
i know. we should not have hesitated then. i stopped you before i even realized it myself
sounds like a very hungry criminal came up with a very poor excuse
so even though my secretaries are very capable and experienced, i still can't help worrying for them a little.
my friend once said to me that only people with a strong will and a clear purpose decide to go traveling. maybe it's to see a certain view or to fulfill a certain wish
if you're really so desperate for the ipc to take over penacony blowing up the chessboard isn't a bad idea. start from scratch! that's where the ipc excels, right?
not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. she always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
we should be able to see the stars tonight.
one, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
can you identify the people who left these footprints?
the streets aren't owned by the merchant guild or the ipc but by those who live here.
i was only out there a short time, so it wasn't too bad. but if one were to stay for any significant amount of time well, you can see how that boy is doing.
that judge from the ten-lords commission? she doesn't seem like a warrior, but that tail of hers has some fight in it.
there is nothing to feel distressed about, because nothing, i repeat, nothing, happened here in these woods today. did it?
ah, speaking of which actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
we can and we will! i think it's great!
let's leave that until we get to yuehai pavilion.
because that statement holds true for me as well. this is where the script ends.
we also defeated an ancient robot known as "svarog," and learned some truths about the stellaron.
i suppose you have a point. it would be quite impolite of me to leave the two of you now.
if you feel strongly about something, you should speak up and take action. that's the philosophy i live by.
ohaeur" hello, i'm ganyu. i work at yujing terrace. i've heard that you've returned to liyue harbor recently, so if you need anything, please feel free to come to me.
this is the other solution -- the alternative choice. i created a new solution.
i dunno i think we should be okay. let's get out of here first and talk about it when we're in the clear.
i learned something new today i never knew that the hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
you two as well. no matter how busy your adventures get, remember to come back to inazuma. we'll always welcome you, no matter when you drop by!
i suggest we move to the shrine to discuss our counter-plan. what say you?
mm i haven't kept track in a while. since i started training at flamewheel forge, the number should be three hundred and twelve.
i didn't find the information. it came to me. it was from a lady concerned with the future of the harmony.
sounds like you're speaking from experience
stellarons, huh? ask away, i'm listening.
in your eyes, am i just like the tingyun you remember?
what about chiori and charlotte? i feel like both of them would be more than up to it.
i see but that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
but don't worry, now that his spirit's returned, there just one step left. let's meet up again in two days.
no, i came here to help my cloud knight coworkers get medication for their bruises and swelling.
how predictable did you truly think you could outrun me?
sure, i guess now's not really a good time for stories don't worry -- i can sum it up in a single sentence.
also i should probably ask do you really think we'll be able to pay back everything owed on the dock?
i suppose the things that are common knowledge to us are just a garbled mess to you. if we want to straighten out the threads of this world, perhaps i should explain things to you myself.
we do? i hadn't realized. i've received rigorous military training -- coordinating with soldiers under any circumstances is easy for me
but just as arrangements for the peace talks began to fall into place, i started hearing rumors of collusion between the kujou clan and the fatui. allegedly, their goal is to completely wipe out watatsumi island.
guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
when did the antimatter legion become so weak?
just be grateful that the "little brat" showed you mercy. at least your staff aren't seriously injured.
either way, it is good to be here together with everyone. it has lifted my spirits.
she's also in the running for the legacy how is she going to sneak into the dreamscape unnoticed?
hello, traveler. i'm surprised you still remember my name.
the way i see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection
i need to use the spirit whisper on blade again, but let's play another round first. have you thought of your question? come to me when you're ready. i can wait.
ahh, i haven't been here for a while -- it's nice to be back in the old stomping ground.
don't worry, they've been through worse. everything's going to be fine!
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
this isn't the overworld. we don't do envy and etiquette down here. whatever's on your mind, you can say it.
sometimes when i'm running late, i even have to change back into my original form and climb over walls to make sure the parcel's on time.
they rely on me, accept me, and long for me to bear witness to their stories.
does it look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
very well. come with me, we'll choose some bystanders to converse with.
since that's your testimony, i have no more questions. it appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case
he's like a furnace, always lit with bottomless fire. this fire will either completely be doused in a storm, or melt down his own existence with it.
we really could use the extra help, especially from capable individuals like yourselves
all you did was chop down a few monsters. don't get carried away with yourself.
you rather sealed my fate there, with your "special thanks" at the end of the show.
if all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then clockie's counterpart is definitely the watchmaker.
take, par exemple, how this troupe pines for their late director things such as this i have never witnessed before. and so, i should like to observe, perchance to understand.
the first thought i have when things don't work out is to run away. starting from today, that's no longer the case.
make sure you live it up tonight! i'll be happy as long as you're enjoying yourselves.
is that right? then i guess mister albedo must be an artist working with the yae publishing house.
yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
hehe, i've noticed that you can't keep your eyes off this crown. would you like to try it on?
yes... yes, we will. but not yet. before the hunt, we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
if i'd asked you to tail uncle tian, you'd have ended up at a dead end, too. it's fine. so, where did you lose him?
that's because that wall records liyue's secrets. merchants have always been attracted to secrets.
is this some kind of villain entrance line?
traveler, paimon, you are just in time.
what a shame. you're only a step away from completing the mission assigned to you
if general huaiyan hadn't arrived in time, i probably wouldn't be here talking to you now.
corruption and madness are lurking behind these anomalies. i must deal with them myself to prevent further troubles.
interesting, now you want to talk. seems you've had a change of heart.
she gave the order to expel me herself and refused to see me i never understood that behavior, and i gave up trying to use logic to work it out a long time ago.
where did the morning go alright, soon as i see a good spot, i'll set up the stove and cook us some lunch.
beacon of the trailblaze
you and paimon are more than welcome to keep attending our shows.
did they scare you? these two are wenyuan and shanghua. they work for me.
i was gonna wait for the master diviner to get off work so i could show you around and teach mister yang how to play celestial jade.
judging by where it's docked, it must be heading for central starskiff haven. nice, we'll be safe there.
plus it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.
pretending to use your dad again as an excuse if he knew about this, you'd be in big trouble.
i didn't expect him to be willing to go through so much pain just to deny us some intel.
let's keep moving. watch out for monsters.
i've been watching her closely for a while now, and the first "invitation" was in the banquet hall of the hotel.
hey, don't worry. i'll help you.
i apologize for my tardiness, once again.
this hivemind could make breakthroughs in problems that even the smartest geniuses can't crack.
if the shogun rather than i were to discover them yes, perhaps she would have left the situation alone.
oh? you're earlier than i expected
for example wenyuan. shanghua.
still, it doesn't look like they're rolling out the red carpet we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
the next stop, to pave the way for the future that is written.
times change. suddenly, the lantern rite of today is a wholly different affair from the past.
since you agreed, i'll take you at your word!
but anything related to the abyss makes me feel like there is some unknown danger lurking beneath the surface
traveler, please feel free to explore. i'll be at the ready if there is any sign of danger.
by following the medicinal fumes, we should be able to retrace the steps of the disguised borisin.
in the past, i used to have many believers coming to see me at the shrine every day, and most of them came for the same reason.
alright, if that's what you want to call me, go right ahead.
a gift from belobog's number one rock star -- you're not allowed to dislike it! or at least don't tell me if that's the case
now it is time for the final battle.
i'm merely performing the duty required of a master.
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
my "origin," huh i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
oh, really? but i never guess wrong.
before i met xiaohan, i always imagined everyone at the ipc would be like skott -- overbearing and dodgy.
then it's in your hands. elio didn't say anything about what happens next.
something this important is beyond their jurisdiction. only the lord of the night can decide whether we can grant an ancient name to one who does not hail from our lands.
i see. please extend my regards to the ten lords
because i blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
oops, well, looks like i lost. here, the mastery mark is yours.
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
i see. and what does my boss say?
seeing as i have nothing better to do, i'll comply.
ah, i'm fine, don't worry about me. let's discuss the matter at hand.
great! then let me give you a demonstration first.
exactly what it means: down.
well then, it's time you felt the power of "mechanical fever!" pela, let's show them what we're made of!
the battle is now upon us. let the devorator once again tremble under the blade of the marechaussee hunters.
it all comes down to knowing the rules.
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
and perhaps the grownups among us could refrain from acting like children?
which means that the content of this book must have been approved by her in fact, no. it may even have been her idea in the first place.
that's just it -- there is no deal
unlike me, makoto was no martial artist. whenever similar crises had arisen in the past, i was always the one to face them in her stead.
the lord of the night is an ancient entity that rules over the entire night kingdom, constantly borrowing the power of the sacred flame to combat corrosion from the abyss.
no need to play the hero, i'm going with you!
well, since we're already caught in the rain, we might as well enjoy it! saves us the energy of running for shelter, at least.
well hello there, young ones. what brings you to the shrine? it just so happens that i have a wonderful novel here. i highly recommend it.
but this is not its most intrinsic function.
why? because i also want the wardance to go smoothly.
time to get to work. let's prepare ourselves and meet that esteemed "supporting actor."
little gui's methods can be a little unorthodox, but that's just because she has a vivid imagination when it comes to getting things done, she's actually pretty reliable.
uh i might not be a scholar, but i don't think calling someone a "hawk" is a compliment.
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
perfect timing. wenyuan just sent word that the fatui ambassador, yusupov, just left the embassy alone. he's heading in the direction of qingxu pool.
recently, however, supplies stored there have started to go missing for no obvious reason.
"sparkle has disguised herself as another character" wouldn't that be you, mister sampo?
nevertheless, when it comes to things like ghosts and ghouls, spirits and souls, the one thing everyone knows is you never know what to expect
since you are here, do you two want to try feeding the dromases?
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
keep moving. just walk forward at normal pace and don't do anything to give away that we suspect anything.
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
don't imitate the memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! well
seems like the smoke is getting thinner
mister khasani found a new way to look at art. he decided to stay at the theater to watch us grow.
why would i dare leave through the main entrance after smashing the aurumatons?
it's almost as if you joining the crew has given everyone an extra boost of energy...
i followed my phlogiston trail earlier to a stronghold guarded by soldiers. i have a feeling that ororon is probably being held inside.
this dream is becoming more and more separated from reality.
if you provide some help for us, then we might just put in a good word later to reduce the terms of your punishment.
besides, if i can get the hang of this teapot trick, i'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever i go
there are people born impoverished who don't know what hope is. there are also people born broken who do not know what it's like to be whole
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
this guy is really into these puppets.
huh? wait, you're seriously inviting me?
unfortunately, that is something i can neither confirm nor deny.
now then, i'll entrust the preparation efforts to all of you.
she had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
since neither of us is eager to engage in combat, let us respectfully part ways.
...and stopped responding to messages in the same time window!
the sound of rain masks the enemy's footsteps. stay alert.
what? so is every person in teyvat who doesn't want money gathered here to shoot this film? don't tell me chiori isn't being paid either
he seemed to think those stories were the best things ever, though. he was so into 'em that he'd call the whole brigade over and make them perform the whole thing as a play.
but with you by my side, we will emerge victorious. let's go!
i'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound looked like its winged blade. we've all witnessed it in action before.
well, it's getting late. why don't we call it a day for now.
miss topaz, you mentioned accountability
relax, i'm just joking. baishi probably made arrangements yesterday to add a few extra dishes to the breakfast menu.
it's a very long story, so let's deal with the problem at hand first.
huohuo has been browsing ghostly grove for hours. every time she finds a suspicious incident, she says: "do you think tail did this?"
these poor little things stumbling about
heroes, your attention please.
just one box. the rest were given to me. i really don't know how it came to this much
but i don't want to alarm the public. can i trust you, honorable guard?
i knew you'd pick the right flowers. mom and dad will be so happy.
it's your turn to ask a question. come see me when you're ready.
do you really believe those living in dreams can escape pain and find true happiness?
a little while ago, i took some time to survey every inch of this place.
ah, i have a feeling that our adaption will be even better than the original story!
"one of the healers from the alchemy commission had lady bailu cornered, but then she disappeared into thin air"
first, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
you have a last-minute job for me? okay, uh sorry, please don't try and explain it all verbally write it down, leave a note here. i'll get to it as soon as possible.
they may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. i need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
aventurine? is he still alive? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
did there use to be a temple here?
if i'm not mistaken, the containers in the trove of verdure can be moved around using a control panel.
that's wonderful! you two absolutely mustn't miss the sabzeruz festival!
the homayanis also still post jobs from time to time. their pay is always generous, so me and the other mercs never pass them up.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
i see fine, i respect your choice. let's return to reality.
the hacker was skillful and even taunted us with her seal. her name is silver wolf, a member of the stellaron hunters
that's not usually like him. i wonder what's going on?
ever since i was a little kid, i've always wanted to be an epic hero i never get tired of hearing about the quintet -- i'm sure you'll love it.
when lisa is around, i always have peace of mind.
oh, really? well, that's okay. you're still invited to the sabzeruz festival!
hmm? have you finished exploring the festival?
later on, i realized that it's actually like what mister afshin said aeur" by taking the freebies, i was helping everyone out and saving them money.
"the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen"...
miss seele, did this medicine belong to miss natasha? then can you give me some? the vagrants' injuries are quite serious.
if you want me to appoint a new clan, then naturally, there must first be a new duel.
i had to scare them a little, though. otherwise i hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
and given the looks of you two, i presume that you are here to celebrate the lantern rite?
tell everyone about mother's true motives about a lie perpetrated for seven hundred years
in the golden era you described, the old aurum alley had a trading volume similar to today.
according to the survey results, the stellaron is likely to the north of belobog somewhere in the vast snow plains.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
i must return to the tenshukaku and report on what happened at the exhibition match to the almighty shogun. everyone, please excuse me.
i promised her that i would help her rebuild the connection between the overworld and the underworld, that's all.
respect must be given to the will of every creature. each fish in the ocean swims in its own direction.
aww, poor thing.
you couldn't have advertised your guilty conscience more clearly if you'd tried.
don't worry, you can leave such "boring" events to the grown-ups. i will attend the conference with welt. as for the three of you
hmph, you still don't get it, do you? even now.
good, i look forward to your instruction.
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
if you encounter any troubles along your journey, you need only let us know, no matter the distance between us.
so whenever i feel overwhelmed, i come here to just lose myself in a book and relax for a while
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved"
i was talking to mister yang about my career as a mechanic and my time in the silvermane guards. somehow, we got onto that so-called engine of creation
i caught a glimpse of the mechs in those crates, and they bear a striking resemblance to borisin. i wonder what they're planning this time?
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken right?
if we can't find a way out, we may be stuck underground for some time.
so the truth is clear now, right?
i later saw you walking into the same room, so i began to connect the dots. the situation got a bit tense... i hope you don't mind that i pulled this stunt.
yes, it is an interest of mine.
hmm, so in the end, we still have to start by talking to neuvillette
the amount of fireworks they've amassed there is astonishing. not only did they steal the ones in qingce village but also from other locations, too. they've gathered all the stolen goods there.
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
i don't understand not a single word about the resistance, sangonomiya, or the situation on the front line
all of you here are my distinguished guests. i am determined that each of you thoroughly enjoys yourself.
so long, my friends. may the preservation bless your journey.
i must give him a chance, seele, because other people can't.
without experiencing the curse of immortality, we will never truly know his agony.
hmph, jing yuan trained you alright
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
by continuing with our investigation, and reserving judgment for now.
hmm i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
this is so her style, isn't it?
the way it looks to me is that shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. would you mind telling me what that's all about?
we'll see the candidates now. let's do one at a time aeur" start with qianwei.
don't worry about that for now. you know what kind of punishment you'll face once we report you to the corps, i assume?
the truth does not lie. neither do memories.
as tribbie mentioned, the both of you spared no effort in protecting the holy city. i would like to present you with a gift in recognition of that.
tsk, trying to worm your way in again, huh? but you won't be able to establish a connection if you know nothing about slumbernana monkey~
oh, really? then i won't disturb you.
ha! look at this. after over ten years, the teeth marks are still here.
i know. if we were just a little quicker, we could have stripped away its power
fear not, unless i wipe away your memories, forgetting me is not an option~
the illusion was so impossibly blissful that i realized it was just a dream.
open this door... take a look at the mesmerizing dreamscape, while you can still remember.
hey, why are you sitting on the ground? are you okay?
thank you kindly! shall we head off, then? ogura textiles & kimonos is our first stop.
we're gonna need to get you a front page news story for this one. heck, let's get some billboards!
besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
what strong names! greetings, ninja ruri and ninja hiryu!
there is still some time. have a skim through, get a first impression of what each person's proposing.
so keep your cool. follow me, the farewell ceremony site is just up ahead.
lessig, both you and i never had anything to do with the glory of the lawrence clan. that is all in the past, we are just ordinary people.
sure am. things have been in constant turmoil since i transferred to the luofu. now that i've got a little free time, i'm here to listen to some storytelling.
what makes you so different from her? how would you feel if you worked so hard to create something, only to have your boss wreck it and overwhelm you with unreasonable demands?
excuse me, is the deputy sheriff still around?
i also know quite a lot about the various folk traditions related to kites.
actually, the reason we climbed this mountain in the first place was also because we heard the sound of shouting.
oh wow, the train carriages are so cool. can we put a little stage there?
that girl doesn't talk much, but i know she doesn't see us as her enemy.
we have already investigated the situation at eipekkusu. the sales records are correct, but in the cash box, there are two bags in which most of the cash has been replaced with stones.
maybe this all sounds immature to you, but i feel just the same way. i want to live life not as kamisato ayaka, but as an ordinary woman.
they are simply ordinary items. and there was no coercion or enticement during the auction aeur" every bid was voluntary.
all students from huitzilin's school of shamanism must pass an extremely difficult trial before graduation aeur" defeating me in battle.
well, i'm not a member of the club at all. clorinde simply woke me up first thing this morning, said there was a good script worth experiencing, and asked if i wanted in.
as far as i'm concerned, though your showing in the duel was enough to prove your honor.
perkins is protecting me. i'll be alright. i'm going to leave after i gather up these painkillers.
i have added the memory from earlier into this. if ninja gama does not lie, this will become the blade to slay those fiendlings.
oh, okay, i see. so ei's decided to palm inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date
of course not~ i'm just amazed at this fancy technique of yours, as usual.
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya
still there is one other thing on this topic that i suspect you may be curious to know.
my strategies and my deck are at the ready. let us begin.
remember, to get to port ormos, just follow the river south from sumeru city's port.
this is qingxu pool. full of ruins, crawling with monsters anyone with any sense steers well clear of this place.
i have a bad feeling about this luka always does things on the spur of the moment.
i plead not guilty. how can i be guilty?
each of us has our own past and destined ends. and on this journey, we have been invited by diamond to join him.
the blizzards here are brutal. if we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, belobog would long since have become a dead city -- both above and below the surface.
castorice, please give our guests a merciful farewell.
if things play out as i expect, dragon fiendling will let slip her true nature in this class.
stop deluding yourself. these new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
that's because the great mujina youkai is extra powerful! and that's exactly why i need your help, isn't it?
but you saw nothing of the countless others who will remember the war quite differently. most people suffered terribly through each day.
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
now, if i'm not mistaken, looks like you've got some new ideas.
stargazer navalia is governed by the artisanship commission -- it took me a while to sort out our paperwork. i got a sense of the situation on my way back.
i sent him to look into zhiyi's regular contacts. since zhiyi likes fishing, wupei thought he might know some of the fishermen and sailors, so he took a boat out to sea to ask around.
heaven and earth, rain and wind, the endless sky and the boundless land. forest boars and ocean shrimp, lavender melons and matsutake 'shrooms!
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
tch, what's wrong with her? why would she let it go extinct?
yes. that's where the main force of the silvermane guards is stationed. they've consolidated their position there in order to resist the encroaching fragmentum.
that won't do! you've exposed your shortcomings.
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
i can't let myself see only the things i want to see. how would that make me any different from before?
ever since you encountered those borisin spies, you've been so busy that you've hardly eaten anything. you can't defeat hoolay on an empty stomach.
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
hey, no need to lie, nat wouldn't be upset about what we did.
ahhhh. there's nothing like dessert for improving one's mood. much more enjoyable than meditating alone all the time.
xiao is not here, but
the odds of that are very slim. it's practically impossible. i've checked aeur" all the paper's been burned. there's only ash left now.
to tell you the truth, mister dvorak, i am somewhat related to the adepti myself. i am part-human and part-qilin. the qilin is an illuminated beast.
hehe, who knows, next time, you might see inayah on the stage.
hmm, that's actually not a bad idea. let's go and ask him.
today's training ends here. the qualifiers should be over now. we should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
have you noticed? the balladeer is not happy with the doctor's actions. he thinks the doctor has no right to consider himself as his equal.
really? but, won't research people make fun of me or something if i ask them about a legend?
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences and can come to represent what we seek the most.
oh, i see, my apologies, i appear to have interrupted your conversation with mister zhongli.
every day i see silvermane guards sacrifice their lives in the fragmentum, but i've never had the resolve to change mother's mind.
they must be annoyed that things didn't turn out as planned for them.
the last time i saw her, she was preparing to meet someone on the snow plains. she even asked for a stove set from me
let's leave that aside for now, then. on to the military question: watatsumi island's forces will need to come back under the jurisdiction of the tenryou commission.
no need, i've left the mora under the plate. if you try to settle it with her in person, she won't accept payment for the salad.
especially these days. not only do i have my light novels, but i've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
it's alright, my lady. you were hurt by all of this as well. truth be told, i'm starting to feel a little guilty, watching you cry like this
anyway, i'm not here to harp on you. i just need to know one thing aeur" which way did he run?
i've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near fountain plaza. don't worry, i know my way around the administrative district.
for once, i don't need to work overtime at night huh what a strange feeling
if we hadn't happened to be passing by were you really planning to go into the fragmentum alone?
mingxi, please share with us what the guild has in mind.
come on. let's go down to the docks.
if i had to say one thing, it would be that the decorations are a little simple. it wouldn't hurt to consider adding more presentable articles of furniture.
that's right. i'm surprised you understand it so well
you know mingxi better than i do. would she deceive you with fake data?
you don't seem like you're too worried about anything, so my movement therapy won't be of much use. instead, i was thinking
they periodically throw out a lot of unclaimed or abandoned goods. we might find something that we can exchange for mora.
since you've spent the whole night thoroughly investigating this situation, i can think of no one else more suitable to gain his trust than you.
yes, welcome back, kaeya. why is the honorary knight accompanying you?
no offense, but we have no guarantee this plan of yours will succeed, or even that it's safe.
well, either we reason with them or charge straight through the blockade let's play it by ear!
not exactly i was thinking that you would be involved in the decision itself.
no, it's just a trace of her consciousness left behind after creating this space.
alright. deoteria, is it? how is your son's illness?
she's always bragging to me about it, but it's difficult for me to really imagine without seeing the place for myself. can you take me there?
he doesn't know me and he doesn't know what the lawrence name means to people in mondstadt.
oh, yes. i was going to help some of the other residents of the forest. they've been busy making preparations to reopen the tavern, so i thought i could help out.
hmm. well, confidence is an essential trait for a good chef. he must be an excellent cook.
is everyone okay?
exactly. that, and you are also a kind, well-mannered person with a genuine concern for other people not to mention trustworthy. i would not feel comfortable with anyone else in this situation.
listen: elio can foresee the future, but he can't make decisions for you.
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct
unfortunately, there's no way to know without seeing one for ourselves.
i saw some memory fragments drifting outside the window, and i intend to salvage them.
where should we start? should we go to stargazer navalia first? or the artisanship commission?
that's why there's no need to stress over the freebies. all of us repay others by helping them when they need it.
so, what do you think? i can certainly prepare more for you. it's become somewhat of a tradition to bring strawberry pastries when i visit stephen lloyd. his attendance seems quite dependent on them.
i didn't understand at the time. how can we say that we are maintaining eternity when things are constantly moving forward and evolving?
xiangling is a highly accomplished chef, and her "assistant" is more like family to her.
yep! of course, chef yancui will have the final say on what to include in these deals.
so we clearly didn't order this, yet you prepared it without authorization hmph! mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
lauwick, your character has no more scenes, correct?
fortunately, apart from the language module, pascal is still functioning properly
allow me to explain.
the coast is clear. you can come out now.
no matter how pressing the situation may become, i must remain composed. if i let the stress get to me, then what can i expect from others around me?
by that, you mean your life working as the akademiya's scribe?
as long as everyone enjoys the festival activities, all our efforts are worthwhile.
i would say you've already suffered more than enough.
what huge elixir crucibles. there's still smoke coming out of them.
i'm alright, don't worry! everything worked out eventually. let's wait for the rest of them to get back
that's pretty clever. gettin' right into their heads.
got it. so from now on, i'll be in charge of this operation.
oh? i just received another message -- lemme see what kind of fun is inside this time!
thank you. alright here it is aeur" i've always thought it would be fun to recapture what life was like before i joined the liyue qixing.
hmm actually, all of the knights of favonius' masters throughout the ages have inherited the title of "dandelion knight" or "lionfang knight."
my parents are both famous on the yaoqing! i wouldn't be here otherwise. they've been training me ever since i was born!
thank you, all of you. now i know that this place serves refreshments for both the body and the mind. is that why you and kaeya like the tavern so much?
he's a long-life species, apparently he was sword champion of the xianzhou at some point.
picture a sliver made up of beautiful dust, gases, and tiny specks, twirling around your finger like a captivating plum-colored mist.
mister svarog, can i delete some of them?
so much energy seriously, what's her secret?
jackpot. uncle tian here asked me to assess three candidates for him.
let me guess: a catastrophe is coming to jarilo-vi, am i right?
that's right, it would be impossible for a human
parts of the surveillance system were destroyed when the legion invaded -- it still hasn't been fully repaired. maybe he took advantage of a blind spot.
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
they were tales of desert warriors defeating dragons in the forest, or stories of mercenaries rescuing princesses from rebel armies.
though it may be said that it is in a child's nature to play, the things klee plays with are far from toys. i can never take my eye off her.
look down there. see the mess that remains of those old stalls? that's rivet town's market. the supplies natasha wants are probably there.
i can only conclude that some powerful or wealthy party must have obtained them via illegal means, deploying them as a private force of sorts.
thank you for everything you've done for the sky-faring commission and the luofu. this small seal is the foundation of the xianzhou's prosperity.
gently push the peaches away there. and that's how you chase the jitterbugs away.
so i ask you again. your high bidding price aeur" was it motivated by trust? or was it greed?
i have put out the order to seize all delusions.
from the exam results, it looks like there's nothing wrong with your brain. mister luka, have you been eating anything unusual lately?
it's okay, mister svarog and i can come up with a solution.
forget it. i'm sure you can find a better theme than that, miss charlotte.
well all i did was say my wishes for her out loud. maybe the magic is in the words, themselves, just like the book said!
hehe i wish you both a fun-filled time on narukami island.
hehe. before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
after weighing things up in my head, it made the most sense for only me to stay put.
then, i'll head back for now. i think i need some time to fully digest everything that just happened.
how about it, this journey of beautiful dreams was it to your liking?
photo? this feels like one of my fan meet-ups, haha. anyway, for you guys, i'd do autographs for free.
i've already thought it through, seele. i am madam cocolia's daughter. that will never change.
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
i was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. it seems she was quite frightened, too.
no, i believe that our archon never rejected the arts. even the goddess of flowers dedicated a dance to her
it seems like the intel we got from svarog caused her a significant shock but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful
idyia, the situation is now critical. our window of opportunity to fix this is rapidly closing.
oh, don't mind me aeur" i'm just a disgruntled old hag, right? come on, relax. i'm sure my bark's worse than my bite.
publicly insulting the supreme guardian only elevates the seriousness of your crimes. throw down your arms and surrender!
i kindly request an immediate warp jump out of the asdana star system.
since you came all the way to watatsumi island, you might as well rest for a moment before you return.
oh, it's you. you came with me after all.
it turns out that there is still another piece to the story of kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
it's futile trying to escape. anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. after all you did summon it together.
oh, you mean the special patrol's musketeers?
the vast majority are showing some loss of vitality, but nothing serious.
strange, is that really the lessig that i know?
i couldn't have backed down, could i? besides, we got him good.
th--that's very reasonable, your honor! thank you. i promise we'll leave after asking our questions.
hello, we're from the society for fish price research. we'd just like to ask a few questions.
we bear responsibility for this issue.
already thinking about taking time off? any excuse for a party, huh
fortunately, we don't seem to lack supplies, and even our motley crew has people who can keep their cool when the stakes are high.
"in other words, any place where people can effortlessly begin a dance will for sure be filled with the blessings of everyone's happiness."
it's been thirty years since we last saw each other, right, yukong?
i'm afraid i'd be no match for you.
have i not made myself clear? you're barking up the wrong tree. i don't want this job, nor do i know of anyone else who would.
is it so unthinkable? there are many stories about fallen aeons.
by the way, i'm curious. if my pay is so low, then what about our two lead actors? didn't they travel here all the way from inazuma?
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know
in short, spices supreme will release a series of crossover meal deals. customers get aurum alley shopping coupons when they place an order.
i think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. you're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
well, thank you both! i'll have to treat you to a meal after all this ends. i really, really appreciate all of your help.
hold on, traveler. there's something else we need to discuss.
we don't have time to talk about this right now let's set off. hopefully, this little one will help us recreate the memories of castrum kremnos.
i took the liberty of writing them all down. this way, you will be able to adapt with speed, no matter how the events play out.
but i do have one more question for you, monsieur.
actually, now that you mention it, i'm suddenly a little hungry. huh. amidst the thrill of the chase, i didn't even notice.
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
back in this office again the last time i was here was the last time i was here.
do you still remember when we first arrived in penacony? who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
huh, their pace has increased normally, people carrying a heavy load slow down as their journey goes on and they start to tire.
i won't have any of this nonsense in front of the knights of favonius.
good. leave nothing of value behind.
at first, she didn't really want to say anything to me at all aeur" she just gave me yes and no answers.
so many stars who are they shining for?
it's true. i always wanted to become like her. someone powerful, independent, and with a strong sense of conviction but
did you understand a single word i just said? or do i need to bash your skull in some more?
but i thought all of you akademiya big-shots were great speakers?
waeur"wait, it's not going to suddenly start moving, right?
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the grand narukami shrine?
fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
it's someone you know. wanna take a guess?
today's work is finished! please make sure to get some rest!
i wonder who the next person to find a disruptor will be
system space all clear today! great weather for flying!
some people are born with unparalleled foresight and exceptional intelligence but make the most ill-advised choices at destiny's crossroads.
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
the secret of penacony... may be closely related to the trailblaze.
i have high hopes, though. this seems like miko's style, so i'm sure the stories are very entertaining.
sure do! y'know, i was racking my brains before i boarded the express, but now i've got more ideas than i know what to do with. inspiration is a fickle mistress.
"ultimately auspicious" wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
i'm just an eccentric old hag to them. that story's been passed down so long, it might as well be true.
you may not have the courage to challenge me, but i trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
qianwei is a wealthy entrepreneur, mingbo works at the liyue ministry of civil affairs, and zhiyi is focused on study and travel.
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
she might be tougher than flesh and blood, but not being able to feel pain? i don't think that's a good thing.
heh heh, storytelling time is over!
uh, let me ask you one more question do you know the person in the coffin?
but i'm also aware that not all emotions in this world are positive if there are too many negative emotions that go unchecked, then someone needs to step in and stop them.
water continues to drip from the ceiling. in this lightless dungeon, you lack a reliable way to tell how much time has passed.
and all the while, people would be getting sick, losing their homes, and fighting just like in the mine.
that's normal! i can't remember mine sometimes either.
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
i'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
afterwards, we also found he had an antidote on him. had the fatui official grown suspicious, zhiyi would have drunk the poisoned wine himself, and then found an opportunity to take the antidote shortly afterwards.
ooh, great idea! we even have a professional photographer with us. charlotte, would you do us the honor?
upon starting my military career, i made a pledge that the rest of my life would be dedicated to being the xianzhou's spearhead, hunting down the abominations of abundance till the end of my days.
well, this is a complex and evolving situation, so we should be ready for any eventuality. for security reasons, we changed back into more combat-ready attire.
you're the best. the other guests haven't even replied yet
so much commotion. this must be an important meeting.
and, the pyro archon's fate is pointing toward "death."
thank you. you must have put a lot of love and effort into this dish, just like i put so much of me into my dance practice.
if you don't take the payment now, i'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the arataki gang.
yes, and it's all thanks to you.
hm, very perceptive for a mirror.
how'd you like that story? i even came up with a scary version -- wanna hear it?
take a deep breath, as if you're about to blow up a huge balloon. exhale all your sleepiness into it, and then, poof aeur" it's now flying away!
i am not in the habit of resting at noon. but if you wish to do so, i will wait for you.
mm this is why i am so happy whenever i see you making progress.
after all, how can i know which answer is which?
that would suggest that zhongshan is not the murderer.
farewell, bartholos. be sure to get my message to cipher.
and trial two will be complete.
mm high winds. an incendiary attack would be particularly effective.
dear audience, the performance is experiencing a technical difficulty, but worry not! the guards shall resolve it soon enough!
you know the way to the great mine, right? let's catch up with gepard when you're ready!
it was as if i'd lost the thing that was most important to me.
if there were scales, with all the people of fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
i wouldn't say you're entirely on your own, hehe when you're ready, let's get going~
anyway, no point in standing around here worrying. i'm heading back to the alley. talk to you soon!
well, all the pictures will be shot in the alley. so there you go.
because of the crossover meal deals, the alley has seen an uptick in customers.
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
the coffee is strong and rich with just a nice hint of bitterness to it.
let's go -- can't keep a girl waiting, can we?
you don't look so tough yourself. well, let's find her. svarog's not going anywhere.
the effects of the anti-truth serum will also wear off. if others mention me to you in the future, you can answer however you like, or even pretend you never knew me.
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
i'll take this direction, and leave the other one to you. let's meet up again later.
in which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. the god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
we can put that aside for now. besides, if it's the acting grand master's assignment, and amber's the one who recommended me, i should comply.
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
if i wasn't, then why would i care about you being cold? if you turned into a paimon popsicle, that would ruin my plans for vengeance now, wouldn't it
and those mechanisms protruding from the ground should we attempt to activate them?
from there, you can glimpse the stars that lie at the very edge of the horizon.
he informs you of the locations of the monsters, and a glimmer of hope returns to his eyes.
that will do. i will have the okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
and aren't human emotions aeur" love, hate, regret, and hope aeur" just the most mesmerizing things in this world?
all that talk about making up for my losses was really just to console myself.
like those fish that shimmer like a sword blade whoosh! oh, and those big fish that call when they see people "woooo"!
the reason is simple: in this grandiose and ostentatious dream of the family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
but at least i can say that i no longer desire to play any new roles.
very well. i should also return to the knights of favonius headquarters
well, well, looks like someone's finally seeing sense.
those sages really have some nerve. five hundred years ago, lesser lord kusanali used all her power for the people of sumeru, and what did they do in return?
huh? oh, uh no need. actually i was just being polite, i don't see why not.
just play a round with her -- i doubt she'll let go of this chance to boast about it.
i'm not investigating them due to any bitter feelings i still have towards my father. i just want to protect those that are close to me.
with your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
but do you have any books on the topic?
so tell me. what, specifically, makes this matter so specific?
i'm sorry to make you run errands with me during our big festival. i promise to make this quick, and i'll be sure to get you back in time to enjoy the fireworks show.
and messing with my precious audience system is just a ruse to lure me here so i can lead you to them
really, paimon. it's not like you don't know me. do i look like i know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
mister sharif believes that interpersonal relationships are a byproduct of working towards a goal. once that goal is achieved or abandoned, those relationships would have no more reason to continue.
all in all, he was only here for half a day. i'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation
even if the sky was gonna collapse on the divination commission, the master diviner would be there to hold it up. what she lacks in height, she more than makes up for in stamina.
(the king does not appear entirely aware of his surroundings. the man by his side, though we should keep a close eye on him.)
so go forward aeur" to the end of your journey, and to the ends of this world!
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
am i just a wandering spirit now?
i'd like to invite all of you, as witnesses to this war, to a soul-soothing ceremony hosted by the sky-faring commission. will you consider?
excuse me, sir, but are you the legendary conqueror of demons?
uh? he didn't send you all here?
alright, no need to look so sullen i'm just kidding. come on, let's eat. the food is getting cold.
and yet, despite this, i thought it could do no harm to ask the question, on the off chance that you are interested.
not only have they targeted merchant caravans and ordinary citizens, but other mercenary brigades as well.
suit yourself. worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is ei, so what's the big deal?
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
so it's true? the wangsheng funeral parlor really does have a secret art?
to validate his theories. no wonder his manifesto contains so many insights aeur" it's all the result of his firsthand experimentation.
look, i'm sorry, okay!? i'm sorry i drew a line in the sand without thinking about every possible grain on the other side!
fine, let's see whose desire is stronger, your desire to take it away, or my desire to hunt down all cursed swords!
march, calm down.
while i'm gone, dad's in charge of making fireworks. you've seen how skilled he is, so there's nothing to worry about.
i caught some very familiar memories just now -- she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. there was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger
yes, just stand there and the computer will read your brainwaves, then automatically generate an immersive simulated experience
we won't reveal the names of any victims. we'll just post some pics and videos of the squad engaging in fierce battles with the supernatural! and then come up with some dramatic titles
miss march seventh! have you taken the time to consider my suggestion?
i'll divide the reports into two piles. you take one, i'll take the other. when we're finished, we'll put our heads together.
hmm the geomarrow fuel activation component probably stopped working. do you have a spare one?
i just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
thank you, everyone. this really means so much to me.
hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. i'm really glad i decided to come to qiaoying village.
but no matter what their main priorities are, there should always be someone left at the mansion, right?
that's how outsiders refer to my peers in the zhuming cloud knights and the artisanship commission.
alright, alright, i get it. you won over the big bad director with your superstar aura. you don't have to show off.
i summed up my culinary requirements in four words. is that insufficiently simple for you?
i said relax, there's no need to go treading on eggshells. do you really think the eternity i pursue is something that can be shaken by dango and milk?
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
sure. coincidentally, i have something to do here as well. seems chance has brought us all together.
i guess we should return this little fella and the parts. i think i can i'll repair it.
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
that's right! an empty ink bottle, to be exact. still remember the taste of the "magic tonic" you took a sip of, paimon?
this purple ninja secret brew seems like it would replenish my ninja power. shatter it and replenish some ninja power.
no need to explain! this is professor capote's autograph alright, but you can't hide your handwriting. the way you join your letters is no different to your childhood diary entries.
i've been meaning to come see you for some time now, but work kept getting in the way, and i simply couldn't find the time regardless, i just knew i had to come thank you in person.
do you remember what i told you before? hunting is about thinking in the same way as your prey, not just mindlessly chasing after them.
i'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
the almighty shogun? it would be improper of me to comment, given that i am one of her subjects. all i will say is that i think that her excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.
oh? you have a good memory. let's go see what's wrong in that zone.
hmph. so you do recognize me, then.
i feel like going back to reality and resting too come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
calm down, no need to panic. that's not why we're here.
well, for ningguang she would talk anything and everything out if she could. but i doubt we can do that here.
great. this is going well.
only a deep commitment to his ambition to become the best made it possible for him to rise above the pain of these encounters aeur" to focus on the way ahead.
hey, you shouldn't be saying things like that.
what a pity i thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. but alas. the time has come prematurely.
hmm, yes. this is a change in the person himself.
you asked if i view general jing yuan as my enemy no, my real enemy has always been myself.
sorry, but could you give me a few more minutes?
and i, in turn, will tell you how i really think.
but this girl once had an aranara as her best friend, and they haven't met in a very long time.
see? even the oratrice has decided to show me its favor. are you sure you want to commit to a charge that will never be upheld?
you hear a few strange noises. suddenly, all the torches in the ruin go out at once.
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
take your time, pick some good ones. i'll be right here.
"the simulated universe is bound to make errors." you said that yourself, and that's exactly what we're experiencing. why is it a problem all of a sudden?
toodle-oo to you too. i'm going home to take a rest now.
no no no, that's too much of a stretch. i cut all my ties with my father a long time ago. he has no control over my life anymore.
it's been lit for so long now that the incense is running out. i'll leave refilling and lighting the incense to the most distinguished guest among us all.
all i know is that deshret's relics must be destroyed.
it's alright. miss sigewinne really put in a lot of effort.
of course, you don't have to accept my help. after all, "aristocrats are naturally superior and need no help from others."
you already asked that when we first got here.
uh you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you
the names you recited all belonged to the bravest hunters. countless monsters fell to their blades. that's likely why the devorator visibly reacted when you said them out loud.
of course, i know everyone here. on penacony, anyone could be lying but the remembrance does not lie.
a few days ago, the spiritfarers received reports about an ipc transport ship that was attacked by borisin. then, a bunch of those abominations were dumped into this place.
that was a little unexpected. don't worry. there's a lot more feed over there. just go get another piece.
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
zhiyi was born into a poor family. paying people to get his stories out there is within the rules of the game, as far as i'm concerned.
i'm not sure, but i suspect pascal's tormented sense of self stems from him being constantly attacked by his fellow robots.
i feel bad about this
uh-huh! i let's just leave it here for a while and it'll be alright, right?
draw your sword. don't you know it's rude to keep an elder waiting?
and thus i became the daughter of madam cocolia. my only identity is that of guardian successor, but i'm not good enough
elio ordered sam and me to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
many people have been lining up since well before dawn to acquire one. i'm afraid if you're only showing up now, you're probably too late.
trianne will open the gate that will lead you to castrum kremnos. may the golden thread guide you on your journey and bring you safely home.
anyway, it's just a legend. i see this view every day on my way to work -- i'm kinda bored of it.
even though they look all bright and colorful, they're still stones, right? aren't you all looking for these kinds of stones?
unfortunately, they picked the wrong fight this time. once we return to the yaoqing, i'll personally lead the verdant knights into battle.
its original owner was an ancestor of the landau family -- rhonda landau. she was one of our great heroes who participated in the defense of belobog seven hundred years ago.
power? now there's a key performance indicator i haven't needed in a long time.
oh? is that so? well, since you are testifying for him, i suppose i won't ask any more questions
the forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
good. now, there are two key points that aristocrats attach great importance to aeur" your manner of speech, and your bearing.
we've heard about this young man called zhiyi who's supposed to be a fantastic fisherman. just wondering if you happened to have heard of him?
i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
ah! yes, yes, -- snowman's palm! ugh, my memory is the worst.
send this report to the ministry of civil affairs and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
ahem anyway, xilonen, i heard that you require my help in crafting an ancient name?
master diviner, do i have to come
oh, it's not for me. i lost a bet with wriothesley, and now i have to buy him something.
you want to go against me? fine, challenge accepted.
that's okay, mister wheel. we're trying to get to the city as fast as possible. we just need you to get us across the sea. in your capable hands, i'm sure we'll get there in no time!
it's not a big deal, dunn. y'know, if you get a chance, would you wanna get on stage with us again?
no, that's not it. you can often find me talking with other girls.
it's alright, i've got gepard with me -- we'll be safe. see you in a bit!
sword practice requires precise movements. this outfit is tailored to fit perfectly and allows for smooth movements. i even added some small accessories. i put a lot of thought into it.
do you know what's become of us down here while you live the easy life? did you even consider the fate of the underworlders?
i see that's a pity. have you considered starting one?
how are things going lately? work is not going well, as usual. i envy the nameless of the express, as they can come and go as they please.
consider this aeur" no one will lose their life on account of having their vision taken away
of course. i--i'm sure there's a story behind it, but that's between you and mother -- i won't pry.
this is no laughing matter. it's an interrogation.
which would mean you'd caused me even more trouble my vengeance would be swifter still!
together, they did something bad -- something terrible. it led to horrific consequences.
but mark my words, droidhead: i will be back for you
it's sanhaj kompore
now, kamisato ayato and the yashiro commission are neutral parties, so i have no right to give orders to the shuumatsuban.
long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
okay i need some time to emotionally prepare myself anyway.
pengyi, please redraft our plans, make a summary report, and send it to the ministry of civil affairs.
during the festival, most of the yae publishing house's editors will be staying near the outlander affairs agency. if you run into any problems, you may find them there.
ah yeah, delavar the "scar-riddled bandit," engur the "wide-eyed butcher," and jabari the "ducktail-bearded crook." the whole lot of 'em are known around these parts.
interesting, she's a member of the genius society alright.
maybe the fading disorder occurs when the ink within the body dries up that would explain why the beings here are forgetting their own stories
hehe, thanks, you two! i can't tell you how great it is to have you by my side. almost makes me feel like i've been blessed by the goddess of fate, too!
nah, it's more he's just honoring a bet. whether it's apologizing or squealing like a pig, i doubt he'd do it willingly.
first, the disciples of sanctus medicus grew uninterrupted on the luofu, yet the six charioteers were not aware of it. that was a dereliction of duty.
let's go to the docks first. lots of people passing through there, you can find out all kinds of things.
he called the dragon something earlier. it sounded like he said
hey, ms. linlang, sorry to bother you aeur" zhiyi ordered a wineware set from you not long ago, right?
uh, hello there i hope we aren't interrupting your rehearsal.
why do i feel that dragonspine has become more dangerous than it used to be i hope it's just my imagination
ororon probably did everything he could to get away because he knew i'd get the truth out of him sooner or later. that brat, i swear
no problem. just think of it as my greeting gift for little klee.
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
i'm not sure why, but i'm getting nervous again.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
my question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
magic words? but, how am i supposed to know what the goddess said to bring them to life?
i can't say that i know her very well, but i think she just has a lot on her mind, and is trying to come to terms with her feelings.
i am jean, acting grand master of the knights of favonius. this is lisa, our resident librarian.
you have one chance, and i'm warning you: don't make me ask twice
hmm, only problem is the view here isn't great. are you sure we'll be able to watch the aurora?
even though it has suffered fragmentum corrosion, this is still part of belobog. it was our home. the guards know this place like the back of their hand.
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
then next time i'm back in belobog i'll tell them i boarded the express, and i'm sure they'll give me a hundred different explanations of how it happened
all of you have been busy with various preparations for the competition. today marks a perfect ending to this warrior's spirit event. your efforts have been recognized by the almighty shogun.
before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto, once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
yeah, thanks to you. i'm really grateful. alright, time to hit the "stage"!
what's up here? some kind of toy?
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
and, the tuskpir loves "strong" memoria: the more depressed you are, the more happy it'll be. isn't that right, little fella?
these uninvited guests keep talking about "asset evaluation," whatever that means. all i know is they're seriously disrupting the lives of the underworlders!
oh. so you're not a mondstadt youkai?
recite the incantation in your heart, little one. also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head aeur" a wish, for example.
hee-hee, i like your sense of humor, benefactors. of course i'm happy to see you! when things settle down, i might even get promoted for catching a stellaron hunter.
in truth, i know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
it's a present. of course it's gotta look the part.
klee, you always say that. i hope you will abide by your words this time.
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
alright, i'm done here, time for me to go. i'm heading off again in a few days, and i still have to prepare.
a chance combination. hmm, interesting. may i try this drink?
the staff said that spectators would be less inclined to come if the contestants and commentators were all from the akademiya.
though i gotta say, uncle tian, you say you're into behind-the-scenes planning? my work's of the covert variety, too don't you think i might make a good tianshu?
seele has been like this since she was little -- impulsive and eager to be the best. for people who don't know her, they might find her difficult
take it easy and relax. deep breath, in and out. once you've taken a long exhale, calmly tell everyone what you want to say.
it's alright, you're safe now. we'll bring you back.
i don't think you'll need my guidance for what comes next.
but don't be mistaken, i'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart like collei. my job is purely to monitor and ensure that lessig doesn't cause any more trouble here.
patience, my friend. i will reveal the answer to you but that time is not now.
then keep that fire burning and learn with all your heart.
next up is the skill sheet. you have a limited amount of skill points that you can use to learn a number of skills. the more points you invest in a particular skill, the easier it will be to pass associated checks.
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
he needs you. it's essential if we want to reclaim penacony. recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, i opted to join forces with him.
i'd rather focus on resting first i need to wait for my heart rate to recover before i go chasing another heliobus.
and we're done. i hope that you like it.
i don't blame her. i got excited when i heard people arguing at the dock and the rest is history.
may your spring of wondrous magic never run dry, and may all who call you their home lead happy, fulfilling lives
when we were at mingxing jewelry, i admitted that my decision to sacrifice the jade chamber was a calculated one. i had already considered what i stood to lose and to gain.
looks like you've forgotten -- there is a memokeeper girl in front of the express' shattered mirror.
but the memory zone up ahead appears to be severely twisted. be careful, everyone.
and the "utterly absurd module" has also been disabled? something's definitely wrong here. i checked a couple days ago to make sure every puppet has it switched on
thanks, franz. i'll put in a good word for you with my brother and get him to promote you!
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans)
whoever is secretly helping zhiyi must be seeking to benefit from his actions after his appointment. so we should be able to find some hints in zhiyi's manifesto on who we're dealing with.
wanna explore fyxestroll garden with me? i know we're gonna get to the truth this time.
ah, how wonderful. everyone's keeping their promises today.
everything alright? you feeling okay?
are there any other clues around?
if running the store gets a bit too much, take some time off and wait for me to return.
in your eyes, our shows can't meet the akademiya's expectations.
barbara and lisa have both spoken to me, and there is something that i have realized. regardless if i approve it or not, klee will go where she wants to anyway. this is how it has always been.
i will lay this issue aside for now. but we shall revisit it as soon as the tenryou commission has resolved our internal issues.
okay, now answer me honestly were you the one who helped the captain escape after his battle with the pyro archon?
we're still preparing the starskiff for the ceremony. please, everyone, come back to me when your work is complete.
not really, no. she was a military history major -- very different from what i was doing.
"the goddess of fate used ink to compose her stories on paper, and the goddess of creation used her power to bring those tales to life."
should be. i don't think they have enough manpower left to post guards and defend their perimeters.
the word "borisin" was only used to refer to those wolf masters. i'm a foxian who was born in one of the "fallen territories"
thanks to the "favor" of the lord ravager, i've become a player in this game.
unfortunately, the workings of the prophecy still remain a mystery to us all.
i would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
it was only after i grew up that i realized the wall of samiel isn't just there to keep out the sandstorms. it serves a more important purpose aeur" keeping out people like us.
fine by me. then i'll take my time. but you'll be begging to tell me everything by the time i'm through.
wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. everything we do is for the citizens of the underworld. that passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
when my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
no need to thank me, just a cloud knight doing her job!
well, no not yet, at least. i promised my lady that i'd stick around until next week.
that's not the only one. look at them. #seven thousand, six hundred thirty-one and #ten thousand, one hundred thirty-six are affected too.
hehe, they symbolize the goddess of flowers after all. it's just a shame that all the real padisarahs went extinct after her death.
do you think i know nothing about the history of penacony? don't drag me into your banal office politics.
you should be thanking me because if it weren't for me cleaning up this mess penacony would still be in shambles. don't you think?
unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. the clamor is not fitting for desserts. by the way
i admire the work put into the set. still, it's obvious the script writer has never paid a visit to the fortress of meropide.
the arbiter-generals concluded that phantylia did not intend for you to survive. if utilized strategically, this could give the alliance an element of surprise.
chartonus come to think of it, i remember hearing about them making a holy vessel for kremnos.
so, how long am i going to have to play this role?
well, don't blame me if i find it first and melt it down.
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
it appears they may be the thief's accomplices. they were probably hiding here to wait for the stolen goods.
i'm a doctor, not an informant! very well, what's the question?
hey, you two! cat got your tongue or something? if you knew what was best for you, you'd get out of my way!
also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. one piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
it's a bit of a mouthful, but i liked it at the time it was a rock 'n' roll name.
minlin now that was a smooth operation. thinking back on it puts me in a good mood.
they could have just as easily bought goods such as food and medicine directly from caravan ribat or port ormos.
first, look at those two sky-faring commission staff members. they've been observing us in secret since we arrived here.
he'd say, "you'll be fine as long as you remember to stick with dad," but even then, he left most of the parenting to the brigade. the one thing i do remember is that he used to tell me stories.
the only other way to affect the anemo god's power is to take the holy lyre.
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
so, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the watchmaker?
perhaps, but we must investigate the buoys regardless.
my lady, if you went to port ormos in your current state, we'd both be in for a lifetime of trouble.
in places where sunlight struggles to reach, you generously share your wealth with the children, the elderly, and the poor in urgent need of help.
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
you have quite the sense of humor, benefactors i've encountered more trouble with you than i have with the merchant fleet in ten years.
you mean that someone else got here and took everything before us?
the more i think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
huh? ah i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
unbelievable, right? the food is so good.
by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
no need to stay here if you have a pressing matter. we all know you can't leave palais mermonia for long.
didn't expect those pooches to actually recycle them all
in their eyes, we're mere consumables, cannon fodder used to slow down xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
wishful thinking is only going to lead to disappointment, idyia. let's stick to the plan, we'll get there.
i'm afraid it's not that simple. the stolen goods will have to be kept as evidence at the police station for some time. they will not be available for purchase in the immediate future.
how impressive! that's quite a fancy way of saying "i haven't learned anything so far."
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
oh, what a pity. i was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
listen, you've never been labeled as a social pariah, have you?
the starskiff is ready for the ceremony now. everyone, please place your objects aboard the starskiff.
i hope you'll grow up happily in this forest.
well, when i think about my time here, i've spent most of it behind a desk, filing documents.
he will be fine. cloud knights, search for the target!
ugh, there'll be no need for that. i've seen them already. there's no need to go back over scenes i've witnessed in person before!
a world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the garden of recollection
that's enough chatter. get to work!
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want.
catching ghosts is a night job -- it only makes sense to sleep during the day.
wildfire can provide that while svarog is recovering.
okay, the stage is yours~
there's also the saying: "from misfortune comes bliss."
and also my mind was consumed entirely with the plight of inazuma and the fate of those closest to me.
it's not my fault that i'm super popular! what was that saying again? my popularity hasaeur"
alright, i won't disturb you two any longer. bye-bye, now.
honestly, i didn't expect our ragtag bunch to do this well. we just came together last minute to save the archon, you know?
maintain my weapons, check my next job, sneak in a quick nap.
i guess that's why everyone wants me to get more rest and relaxation apologies.
that thought has filled me with sorrow, as if a piece of my life had been stolen away, and i had no part in it.
all familiar names. dakan al-ahmar has been trading for a hefty supply of food, weapons, and medicine. it seems that in the past, they used to receive some canned knowledge as well.
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing
she is your sister, after all.
(i lied aeur" hearing each other's thoughts actually depends on the strength of the connection between our memories.)
though the strike from the general was timely, its destruction was also immense. when "emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
when the swarm disaster began to take hold, tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple aeons.
huh? you start work this early?
locking the door was necessary. i don't think we could have saved two.
the situation has changed completely. without the assistance of a judge, continuing would place all of you in grave danger -- defeating the purpose of the squad.
but it was the dandelion knight that represented her hopes for the future aeur" a future belonging to the newly formed knights of favonius
wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?
that's exactly what i had in mind! nobody knows who's gonna come out on top! it could be me, could be someone else it'll probably be me, but whatever happens it won't be him!
three thousand, seven hundred years according to our records, the adepti signed a contract with rex lapis to protect liyue three thousand, seven hundred years ago.
uh something doesn't feel right. it's obviously an abandoned shopping street, but it also feels like people were here not too long ago
it would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
sometimes, you can convey more with dance than words. if you don't know what to say, then just dance.
such a pity though as your friend, i respect your choice.
but our enemy has long lain hidden within the harbor. if we do not act against them now, they will surely gain the upper hand.
we had a difficult start, but things got easier. look, that's the barge i was talking about.
oh, that? that's a hologram. what? i can't possibly summon the real droidhead here, can i?
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
even though the protagonist refuses to acknowledge his innate talents, he has a rare dedication to justice.
this crate looks promising. maybe there are spare stove components inside
i am fortunate to have had lady guuji's help this time. i likely would have struggled to find a candidate on my own.
it's the main commercial street in the exalting sanctum, although it's a lot quieter since the whole stellaron crisis thing.
well, this is a dramatic change, unique in all of the millennia of liyue's history. everyone is eager to do their part and make their mark in the age of humanity.
*sigh* i understand. well, this photo will always be close to my heart. i'll make a copy for you too, clara.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape.
she sure knows how to boss people around.
it's not polite to ask a girl her age, no matter which xianzhou ship you're on.
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
that's a tough one, alright there's plenty more besides memories held in the ley lines.
let's try something else. as long as we're in liyue harbor, this kind of misunderstanding is inevitable.
even if you were the reason that all of this happened, no one would blame you.
it's rare to hear such comforting words from you. i graciously accept them.
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
"the elite player has already bested last year's champion, and claimed this year's title. hence, this year's event will crown two champions."
i don't know how deshret's relics sees it, all i do know is that dakan al-ahmar has become more and more aggressive over the last few years.
you're awake, lazy bug. looks like you had a nice dream.
my wish has not changed to this very day. however, it is not only out of consideration for myself that i have built the jade chamber anew at this time.
centuries of pretending to be a different person changes you completely. i'm not the same person i once was.
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger.
we are done here, yes? i am free to go, am i not?
remain vigilant at all times. any suspicious movements must be suppressed as quickly as possible before the situation gets out of hand.
we have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times it's hard to tell from just a few words on the internet.
i've got a lot going on right now, but i'll try to make it next time.
it was one of the oldest and most precious items in the general hall collection -- the meteor fragment.
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, but the ninja belief in exorcising evil will never change.
the impairments of short-life species can be corrected with ingenia or surgery, but that's an impossibility for xianzhou natives.
just like today -- would it have mattered if "baique" had brought you here instead of qingque? it makes no difference at all.
no, but what is predetermined is the future that has value.
anyway, i was also woken up by the commotion. looks like all the warriors from the stadium are on the move.
ah, about that well, the homayanis really needed bodyguards, so they reached out to the blazing beasts.
there's no need to worry, though. i'm preparing for a public debate with the akademiya.
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
the master control zone where we are now is the control center of the whole space station.
one after another, people were taken by the water all those treasured lives and memories, washed out of existence in an instant.
his scent is so faint it's almost imperceptible, but it also carries a pungent smell of rust. he must have many stories to tell.
i must apologize for your long wait, honored guests.
is it your true wish to live side-by-side with the people of simulanka?
mm. i understand now.
seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
we can move on to the problem at hand, now that both of you have some understanding of amphoreus's history. come with me.
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
our xianzhou forbears knew this well, and that's why they entrusted the duty of guarding the roots of the arbor to the vidyadhara. however, the vidyadhara are still only mortal beings.
surely you jest. i would never intentionally make things difficult for my players.
this was taken by a member of the master capote fan club less than twenty-four hours ago. in other words, you went to find professor capote today...
oh, dunyarzad! it was taking you so long that i assumed you got trapped at home, but you made it in the end!
yeah... we need to find arlan quickly. i need to apologize to him in person!
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal tends to leave a deep impression.
i still hadn't really met many children my age at that time, so i didn't know how to interact with others.
everyone played their part, and thanks to everyone's efforts, the performance was a great success.
did you organize this entire breakfast?
watanabe will be stationed in the area. be sure to alert him if anything unexpected happens.
did destiny's slave make you do it?
that's what mister svarog said. he said pascal's emotional intelligence was like a virus that infected the entire base network at some point.
they'd run away as soon as they saw me, or they'd be shaking with nerves and unable to speak.
actually, i've sensed a familiar feeling ever since i arrived here. it's brought some old memories to mind.
we have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
reminds me of me and my brother -- sort of a love-hate relationship.
everyone on the express is a passenger.
don't you know how many sentry posts the family has built, and how hard it is to get you out of here?
for your first time, i shall personally guide you into the depths.
simply put, pascal's brain is filled with junk information of unknown origin. this junk, along with hardware that's incompatible with his core, caused him to lose his ability to communicate.
come with me. miss dunyarzad, please come along as well. i still can't guarantee that this area is safe.
looks like the tuskpir not only regenerates rationality, it also destroys it. now that'd make for an interesting research topic.
i shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, onodera. please take the opportunity to have a good rest. after all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
and yet all of you now represent a third choice -- different from both the merchant guild and the ipc.
i did consider that possibility, and i won't lie aeur" it'd be a real bummer if that were the case.
"who are you to command me? does your inhumanity know no end?"
let's get something to eat while we walk.
being on the same level as screwllum -- who's probably the best in the universe -- is nothing short of spectacular. it's beyond my abilities, computers are not my forte.
he went missing recently, and after searching his home, we found evidence that led us here. he appears to believe that somewhere in sumeru lies the key to restoring our clan to its former glory.
teacher, show him the way forward.
i dig jokes -- there's just too much sorrow and resentment in the world. sure, jokes won't make the world any better, but they don't make it any worse either.
i think i'll stay behind. that way, if something does go wrong, you'll have someone on the ground to get you some help.
where else? you think we'd leave you on svarog's turf?
by solving the puzzles, you prove yourselves worthy of inheriting the secrets of the past.
miss kiminami, how do you do?
please, mister svarog
sumeru is run by wise and mighty sages. to them, us desert-dwellers are nothing but tools that can be used and discarded at their whim.
hmm out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine!
may i have this page to record and draw?
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
i've heard that even the unofficial genius invokation tournament is enjoying a huge turnout. many serious tcg players have registered for both the official and unofficial ones.
(something feels off about all this. guess i'll just have to improvise.)
but once the bag of tricks is empty, and the curtain falls, it's time to end the show. the spotlight is no place for someone with no more cards up their sleeve.
i'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. and as a silvermane guard, i have a lot that i need to ascertain. nothing more.
this whole thing is making me pretty nervous, actually it's like i've been pushed on stage without being taught the choreography!
that's him if the legends are true, then he was a man who created an aeon.
sure, i understand. i'll be waiting for you here.
navia, the president of the spina di rosula
my name is tingyun. i'm the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. may i venture to know the illustrious names of my heroes?
i'm just going to have a polite discussion with those two grown-ups about what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.
if i wasn't ningguang, gou san'er probably wouldn't have handed all of these over to us.
in fact, we were just talking about you
anyway. more importantly right now, the fireworks show is right around the corner and the materials still haven't arrived. we need to think of an alternative
hmm i give it a nine point five!
"on this marvelous lantern rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
a handwritten copy of a storybook the paper's already yellowed, and it looks like it's about to fall apart
uh thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
i had a feeling there would be trouble during the wardance. but throwing both the pirates and the cargo in jail? that's a new one.
his piety and wisdom were acknowledged by the dendro archon, and she finally gave her blessing to him.
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
and that's not all deep down, i've always been looking forward to the day i could wear something different from what i normally do.
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe an explanation.
(huh? does that mean hu tao also knows!)
unfortunately, my cousin could not give me a definitive answer on this, despite scouring the family library.
never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? good. we are running out of time, so let's get moving! chop chop!
is that so looks like you're a bit hard to please. trusting and perceptive at the same time.
could it have something to do with that clockie that only you can see?
of course not. the memokeepers' divination techniques don't all involve memories.
thanks for the suggestion, i'll consider it.
actually, she's been quite diligent in her swordplay practice and hasn't taken many breaks lately. i think she deserves a day off.
gladly, beats standing here twiddling my thumbs.
no need to be polite, i can help any-- huh? you're just here to say hello? you don't need my help?
people show you whatever side of themselves they want you to see. i know this for a fact.
if that's the case, it's all the more reason for me not to return to the luofu and complicate things. i might as well take advantage of this situation.
so, one of my answers will be true, the other will be false. as for which is which, that's up to the asker to make the call
oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
you know i think i've come to realize that i'm lacking a certain fun side?
if you can't offer an explanation, i'm afraid these cloud knights will have to escort you out.
take a good look at your pocket. your friend has already given you the answer.
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
general, did you hear about miss tingyun?
i'm fine, seriously. really! i
when we were trying to find a way to save the theater, we heard many stories not of the theater, but of the people whose lives have been touched by it.
it seems like you've met a lot of people who don't tell you the whole story.
lord gnaeus what do you intend to do?
my brain must be filling in the blanks probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
anyway, when it's finished, let me know. i'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.
you're welcome! well then fare thee well, master dugu.
a fun-seeker investigating fun things in the universe -- i guarantee there's no way that could ever go wrong!
it's just i see people fighting for their lives and here i am thinking about how to escape i feel guilty about that.
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
perfect, thanks for that. be sure to pass my regards to everyone else in the brigade as well.
any of that sound strange to you?
ode to fool this must be the second act.
miss acheron, i have a suggestion: why not split up and look for a way out, and meet up again when we find something? that would speed things up.
"the stars exploded, and the express has to go everywhere to pick up all the pieces, and that's why it flies up in the sky."
at the intermediate stage of my journey, or chuuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. the art of the polearm aeur" slashes and backslashes.
what's wrong? are you not feeling well?
an outlander has never received an ancient name before. i wouldn't be surprised if something equally unprecedented happens when you connect to it
yikes good thing i didn't wear it for long when i was working in sumeru city. at first, i thought it was a good thing, too.
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
well then, we shall oblige.
i will see to it personally, you have nothing to worry about.
i don't quite understand it, but i'm happy that we're able to all meet again.
this is zandar. zandar one kuwabara. the first genius in history.
xilonen is working on the last part of your ancient name. it's best not to bother her when she's in the zone.
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
you carry yourself with such dignity and grace, but you still have the heart of a child. lady bailu loves these types of accessories. let's go with your suggestion.
card games these days are rather ingenious.
wait what are they up to?
norbert's position is indeed an idle one -- it's no wonder he has time to socialize with members of the limestein family.
i was just wondering who in their right mind would come out to a place like this. so, it's you two.
i couldn't tell if she was complimenting me or mocking me. either way, i'm not about to let it go.
...it seems like i'm too old to qualify for that.
i feel very fortunate to be right here, enjoying the fireworks, and enjoying the view of liyue harbor.
pops, are you alright? they didn't do anything to you, did they?
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
it's still early, so why don't we get some tea at the alchemy commission? we can discuss your suggestions for revitalizing the commission.
mm i truly hope so.
i just heard that there was a flood. but given everything that's going on, i think it likely had to do with the border as well. that would at least explain the strange weather going on at wuwang hill.
oh, seems the world's gained yet another tcg player.
gods above, you're not talking about work, are you
really? you're not kidding, are you?
amber will fall asleep in the snow if we keep going much longer come on, let's move! we shall head to albedo's camp and get some rest, take stock of our supplies, and decide how to get off this mountain.
that cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. if she detects any change in the underworld, i don't know what she might resort to
but there is some information i can give you. that place is also used to welcome non-humanoid visitors and has a shuttle that connects to outer space.
but there is a type of dream that we will never awaken from, and should never awaken from
good, then i'll also count on you with the preparation of the receptacle.
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
she just wanted somewhere uninhabited to experiment with her "life helix system." ruan mei is certainly very talented, but she hardly interacts with anyone. she lives like a hermit. pity.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me
so, hurry to the sanctuary of surasthana. assuming nothing weird happened
whenever i go for a stroll around mondstadt and see the citizens happy and free, i feel deeply inspired.
really? thank you. so where is the "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder"?
incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits."
have you still not realized your situation? from the moment you appeared, you were doomed to one fate.
there's a monster heading this way what should we do, gepard?
always distinguish between reality and imagination alright, grey?
guuji yae please tell me you are not sheltering a wanted criminal here?
i admit i'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. but this is also a safe place.
you guys figure it out for yourselves. i'm due to catch up with an old war friend i've not seen for quite a long time.
haha, i'm worried you don't trust her plan. just relax -- little gui is unbeatable in her area of expertise.
"a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. if we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
the paperwork will have to wait. i'm coming with you.
one of you seems to understand the significance of the treasure already. if the rest of you wish to follow suit, you may remain here in the meantime and explore your surroundings.
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
i think the guards must have done this intentionally.
there aren't any scary people here, right?
you all have saved belobog from danger time and time again. we don't have much, but we'd like to say thank you with this small gesture.
during the archon war, piles of corpses covered the wilderness. people were plunged into misery and suffering. disease was spreading all over the land. death devastated the world of the living.
ultimately, this little trotter is your companion, and now they're a part of your journey.
people tell me you're an extremely enthusiastic worker and are very generous with your help.
before you, the door to the treasure, sealed and undisturbed for more than a hundred years, finally swings open.
only innocent children and timid adults are scared of thunder. but you're not either of those are you?
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
i thought lisa's pouch was to be used for an emergency. i didn't expect it to contain a set of summer clothing.
living in the underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. i'd rather trek through the frigid snow plains than live in a beautiful cage.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this
it seems as if i've become a pawn in someone else's game.
i bought these shoes for you -- i remember the size and the design. this is undoubtedly your footprint.
right -- if the merchant guild pay back what they owe, the only one barking will be that ipc stooge.
stop! all of you! put down your weapons!
nothing? i thought there was an answer for every single permutation.
fine by me. i was going to be looking for my cousin there anyway.
ah, there you are. let me introduce the team:
oh, there you are. sorry, i got distracted watching the crowds.
it makes things easier for the craftsmen. it's not like outsiders can just walk in here.
"really? but i don't taste... any difference at all between them."
you may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the yaoqing's warriors.
we'll turn the entire heliobi-hunting process into regular uploads. viewers will see that there's nothing that scary about it, and there won't be any public panic!
this is a work habit of mine -- using touch to open my senses and letting the details of your biological existence flood into my brain helps me understand your construction as a living organism.
hmm, things are going a little too smoothly today
let's go. the venue for this meeting is in the kanjou commission headquarters up there. the view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
don't worry, i've got plenty. thanks to you two, i recovered more quickly than usual.
well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know i'm actually working to take care of it.
come on, let's get back to yanshang teahouse.
moze's signal is nearby, but we lost contact just a moment ago
c'mon, just trust me on this one
but i'm unwelcome in liyue harbor. as an adeptus, i
if you don't say anything, then all the hard work we've put into embroidery practice would have gone to waste.
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
according to legend, the sabzeruz festival was originally the goddess of flowers' birthday celebration for the greater lord.
don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the raiden shogun? that's all that light novels are supposed to be aeur" a bit of fun.
does this "true taste" have anything to do with that mikhail?
honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. you just gave me an excuse to bring everything forward.
i am saying nothing of the sort, just raising a doubt, that's all. please be careful, benefactors
my second question has to do with the ensuing duel. if the truth is indeed as you described
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
curious about my eyesight? well, i'm not blind. on the contrary, i can see much more than the typical person.
now can you tell us what really happened to aurum alley?
i'm really worried about the future of penacony
whatever case you're working on in the chasm, i'm sure liyue's top legal consultant can handle it without my input.
you were attacked by a lord ravager. by all rights, you should not have survived.
the spirit water shall show you amphoreus' distant and recent past.
precisely. i've been without sight since the day i was born.
well, cyno doesn't seem to be much of a talker, either. i guess that leaves it to my "employer."
still, talking to people i don't know is really draining
the complex locality of this world has been affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
once i was sure that they were going to be okay, i'd slip away without a sound
i overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
who i am, where i'm from, my name it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
right, and that changes everything it could mean a powerful faction is trying to gain influence over the liyue qixing.
then i've something private to take care of regarding that galaxy ranger. let's leave things there, shall we?
moving on. don't try, but you wouldn't even begin to imagine how difficult it is to send a message to nous. and i went all out for it
then let us snap them all out of their disillusionment!
stop wasting our time. every one of us here is perfectly aware of what he had done.
indeed, it has been a while, huixin. i'm flattered, but aren't you exaggerating a little?
there's still one more store. are you alright holding onto that much stuff?
really? don't tell me you're not craving a little vengeance.
just remember not to say too much. be discreet.
last time you entered the plane of euthymia, it was in front of the statue of the omnipresent god, correct?
i'm glad that you found a new life here in penacony, it's just
because of the difficult situation we were in, we formed a temporary alliance to help the residents of the underworld resolve a few issues of survival.
haha, you've no need to worry.
now that we have awoken from our dream, we must learn to say farewell.
don't worry, little layla. they're just apologizing to me for defeating souka. go buy yourself a nice drink, take a break, and catch your breath.
i told you, i've incorporated dance into my swordplay. if you want to learn my sword techniques, you'll need to learn to dance first.
well, i did, which is why
your present will is not the product of erosion. i shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
come with me. i've already reconned the perimeter, so we should be safe.
of course not! it's hard to find someone in mondstadt that attracts contempt as much as she does.
how perceptive. our wind, clouds, rain, and fog are all artificial. the realm-keeping commission's weather pavilion manages the environmental conditions here.
the name's serval. i'm, uh an ex-engineer from the technology division and gepard's sister. pleasure to meet you, chief!
you mean, what are they made of? it's geomarrow that's undergone a change in color. the color of geomarrow is related to the environmental temperature during its refinement.
i'm sorry for making a scene, but i have to melt down this cursed sword! i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands!
but i have with me a letter from lady ningguang. she extends a formal invitation to you in her capacity as tianquan.
hmm? i'm great.
she already went back. as you know, she has some things to settle with the supreme guardian.
did you feel the shift? so many elixir seekers arrive on the xianzhou in the hope of obtaining the formula to immortality, but none have succeeded.
nice to meet you too hehe, you're very polite.
if you're only concerned with my next answer, quit while you're ahead. every choice has consequences, and every consequence carries responsibility.
there's nothing but a jigsaw puzzle here.
all of you, stay focused. i'm right behind you.
so, listen to everything i say. let's go!
you misunderstand. if you were in my shoes right now, wouldn't you want to keep your guard up~?
heh, we couldn't do anything to 'em inside their coop, but outside the akademiya this is our hunting ground.
hehe, thank you both kindly.
i was wondering is it because they share pascal's emotions?
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
so how about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? i'm quite eager to have it back.
nice answer. alright, next question
one bowl of ramen shouldn't hurt, right?
keep a cool head, or you'll expose your weaknesses.
could you please prepare a serving of my uncle's favorite, gebratenes fleisch mit sauerkraut? we'll take it as a gift to him later.
i recognize that woman -- that's elaine from first mining team! quick, let's get up there and see if she's wounded.
i haven't seen oleg. the miners said they saw him take a group further in.
"the fox you gave me is very beautiful, miss shrine maiden, but i still love my old friend the most."
if you want to know how to make money, i will honor our agreement and give you an answer. but that is not to say that it will work for you.
see, there's a piece of paper here! it says "penya sergeyevna"
is that right? kaeya also gave you some suggestions. he is an excellent knight after all aeur" this is a fact no one can deny.
does this place ring any bells, misha?
i don't know how exactly, but huohuo manages to keep that tail of hers in check, even though she's terrified of heliobi it proves she's got some serious talent!
hardly the worst thing in the world, of course. but it has caused obstacles for me in the past.
there's no time. i'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the memory zone.
glad to hear that you're feeling better, mister stream. it's also about time for us to go to our next destination.
even though the training she subjected me to was strict, she always made sure to take me traveling when she had the time. we met many of her friends during those days that was also how i met mister callas and his family.
everything's fine. we were able to suppress the borisin attacks. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
this is what trailblazing is.
while the nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
how do you ipc cronies have the audacity to fight cloud knights? you practically assaulted law enforcement officers.
phew i still get nervous at times like this. it's just like when you step on stage, and you can tell that every single person's gaze is fixed right on you.
just talking about it is a waste of time. since we're already here, let's go and scout out the situation ourselves.
the kids at the orphanage were always getting into scraps when we played out here. if i remember it right, there ought to be some supplies for our cuts and bruises stored in that corner there.
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
thank you, esteemed bard with an enchanting voice. your ballads will endure through the ages, serving as a bulwark for okhema.
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
hmph. you are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. descendant of the takatsukasa clan, you wish to become the new tenryou commissioner. do i understand this correctly?
the dangers lurking within okhema have been eradicated. i've also cleansed the city of filth.
if it would help shed any light on the situation, then please, be my guest.
but if the tenryou commission does catch up to you, then make a run for the boat.
uh-huh. don't worry, i'll take care of any repercussions.
cyno and layla both have four points, putting them both in first place. the rest in descending order are tighnari, faruzan, kaveh, and hat guy.
perhaps it once performed some deed that merited a memorial.
according to the plan, the ceremony will begin in six hours. the skysplitter will be activated, and all visitors will board the ship to watch the contest.
neither good nor bad. there you go.
greetings, mister jut! do you still have any food that's ready-to-go?
you know, ei never said goodbye to me before she stepped into the plane of euthymia.
look, miss himeko: i brought the kid back as promised.
good morning. did you sleep well?
if the books stored in this hut are anything to go by, this seems to be the place where the goddess of creation first made the townspeople of this forest.
use of force here is strictly forbidden. before you proceed, which of you would like to face criminal charges for dishonoring the shogun, hmm?
(he had to set up so many scenes today, and now, he has to join in for this last part i really don't envy his job.)
oh, here you are. swordmasters should greet each other with their swords. old mettle, say hi!
good. i'll have someone attend to this shortly.
we should've already rescued our archon.
my original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. but then i ran into miss hu tao and mister zhongli, and well, you know the rest. i suppose it was meant to be.
meet me on the first floor when you're ready. until then have a pleasant conversation.
even if you don't believe my outsider friends, you should believe me ugh, maybe i've wasted your trust in which case, believe bronya.
well, yeah, i mean, that's why our name is on the event. it's well-known throughout inazuma.
i'm sure she was simply trying to share some of her enthusiasm, in the hopes that you may find it infectious.
now the fatui have no choice but to keep their mouths shut.
i am yunli. come, take up your sword. we'll get to know each other once we've sparred.
even if a child from the desert got the chance to obtain an akasha terminal, almost all their requests for knowledge would be denied. the akademiya believes we're undeserving.
indeed. any fears i had a moment ago seem to have been dissipated by the dango milk.
also, be sure to tell them that though the lantern rite may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
mm-hmm, pretty accurate nickname, right? that guy has a lot on his plate -- it's enough to make you worry.
is the smell of "death" so enticing, my fine fellow?
it's the first time i've ever invited so many exceptional people to one place. i was a little nervous myself.
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh
hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and ei! are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
trust is of far greater importance than profit in the relationship between me and my informants.
heh, i just wanted to fix your attitude and rub it in a little. after all, you took your sweet time getting here, and we've got important stuff to take care of.
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
that's true. i hope that becomes a reality one day.
maybe she was just in awe of the director's aura?
building a better world for future generations sound great, right? but is it any fun for the engineers and architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
alright, i understand. i'll be sure to take care of it.
this caravan is just one link in their logistics chain. once in the rainforest, the caravan will exchange the looted goods for mora, and the funds will then be passed to a specific person.
but why did little gui have to get dragged into this? this mission is too dangerous for a civilian!
even if i lose, i'll still make choices to lighten the loss -- just like the master diviner is making choices for her own agenda.
hearing urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. in return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
hmm, i see. so the thunderstorm is drawing closer
then, as a champion duelist, i hereby accept your request for a duel, and extend to you my most sincere regards.
otherwise tens of millions of mora is rather a high price for lunch, even one at liuli pavilion aeur" wouldn't you say?
i said why not?
i must say, this is most intriguing
i'm just a healer, and i'm not familiar with the past. i'd appreciate it if you could enlighten me, general.
oh, your master ahem, your father, i mean, never talked about it? it was a kind of monster that was active several centuries ago.
yep. have you been there before?
its change in size and power really is suspicious.
interesting mm, let's run an imaging test first to confirm that your brain has no organic issues. a fighter's bound to run into such problems.
wow, where did the time go
accepted. let's add that to the peace treaty. i can assure you that your vessels will be quite safe in our hands.
she's the girl playing in the games parlor, right? she must have played for years to be that good with how good her skills are, it's almost a martial art for her.
we wandered around aimlessly for a while until we ran into director hu. she'd lit some incense and was burning fetor left and right with a flaming staff.
we couldn't cajole adeptus xiao in the end. he said he'd take a peek from the peaks, but that was all he'd agree to. it's a real shame aeur" i had the perfect poem for his entrance and everything.
thanks for your invitation, but i am the silvermane guards' intelligence officer -- i can't just drop my work and go travelling
but thinking about it since we're already this far, then i'll turn a blind eye to any new grievance.
but as acting grand master i obviously cannot make such a statement publicly.
don't worry. once the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
don't think you can deceive me with some poetic speech! there is no animal alive that would destroy a world so brutally. you are the foulest poison this cosmos has ever seen.
twenty years ago, huh i still remember the gardes leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on neuvillette's desk.
i should state, i have no idea who the championship contender for this zone is, but i am pretty familiar with the mechanisms.
no one in the brigade was any kind of hero, instead, my father and his cronies were more like the bad guys that needed to be taken down.
liquor and wineware i see. let's go.
you guys didn't know? the wardance has a "popularity revival" rule. if eliminated contenders or teams garner enough popularity votes in online polls, they can participate in the repechage and re-enter the ring!
according to some of the older eremites, it does actually rain in the desert on occasion. and when it does, it's always a lot heavier than this.
i don't enjoy fish. there's too many bones, and i can't stand the smell maybe it's because i had my fill of fish as a child.
now that you know, at least we're all on the same page.
you guys are travelers, right? so, where else did you go before coming to inazuma?
i'll be sure to ask some people i know to see if they'd be willing to act as extras.
hey! are you trying to back out before you even hit the arena? hello, we are both wardance competitors.
the duty of the silvermane guards is to serve the people. so, where can we find these robots? clara, can you lead the way?
master kucha, do i count as a "ninja initiate" now?
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
come on, take it. this is the story of you and me. it's a tale that i'll never, ever forget.
the scent where did it go?
but seriously, i'm not about to cheerlead for someone attacking an inanimate object. that's just embarrassing.
oh, speaking of cloud retainer, when did you see her last?
that's strange how did paimon transform into a lavender melon?
the best option was for her to directly interact with humans. there's no need to feel sad, i believe she was content when she left us.
therefore, you could say that you are a one-of-a-kind stellaron vessel.
patrolling the streets is the tenryou commission's job. the shogun has a lot of information to process and orders to give out. she doesn't have time to deal with it herself.
wah wah wah so annoying.
well, what do you think? is inazuman cuisine to your liking?
it doesn't matter why grandpa chose that sword, i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands.
i expect the views here had me lost in thought
come on, let's see if that guard over there will let us past.
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
attempting to storm qlipoth fort by ourselves? forget it, seele. i don't care how skilled you are. i'm not sending you on a suicide mission.
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
thank you. choose whoever you like. wildfire will take care of the rest.
hmm memokeepers should probably think of a better way to show up.
sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. but try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
i am indeed. many of them, in fact.
i just hope the monster didn't get to them.
ah, looks like i'm the one who got distracted.
gotta start somewhere. oh, by the way, did you guys learn anything about the meteor shower?
oh, was she whisked away by work already? i was just about to tell her how great she did.
hmm everyone's talking about this "seawater magma" flavored snack -- it's becoming all the rage on quite a few planets. i've heard they extract seawater and combine it with magma from the mountains.
looks like we're off to a good start! moving forward, i'll definitely be trying more things like this from now on.
so, please allow me to travel with you.
cirrus the only one who may have knowledge of tail's whereabouts is cirrus whose plans were foiled due to tail's actions.
actually, inayah had prepared a special present for everyone before this celebration kicked off.
i still think there's more to this story, though. kokuchuu must have had his own motives beyond just treating leyla's condition.
knowledge is king in sumeru, and their pursuit of it leaves no room for the arts.
everyone, as the grand master mentioned in his letter, the weinlesefest is in just a few days. and how fortunate we are at this time to receive word that all is well with the expedition.
thank you! as appreciation, i'd like to give you a token gift.
just trust in me, your archon, and do as i say aeur" never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. it'll all turn out fine.
you bet! for starters, i'd love to introduce you to my other friends in the forest. even though there have been some misunderstandings in the past, i'm sure they'll welcome the new you with open arms.
they embody life's delights and pleasures, but are equally fragile and short-lived... such regret is inevitable, so let it be.
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
i've briefly traveled with your companions and know their whereabouts, dan heng. please rest assured, your nameless companions are safe, but they need our help.
now that the sparring session is over, yanqing and yunli, shouldn't you politely thank general feixiao for her guidance and bury the hatchet?
sorry if the theater really ends up getting demolished, then you, sohrin, and abhi will all
this tie is a piece of evidence, right?
hehe. oh, we have reason to put you on trial. it's obvious, isn't it?
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side maybe even the same person.
if it were up to me i'd probably agree to the ipc's conditions.
of course! it's just i'm better with brawn than brains
my take on this might surprise you.
that lively young lady told me some things about you
so. any plans for the next step?
in the end, he used that immortality to his advantage and granted the lord of the night eternal life by fusing his existence with hers.
plus, if the dendro archon were to intervene then, it wouldn't feel like our victory was earned.
ugh, how can you call me a weirdo? i mean, wouldn't you say it's more charmingly naive? or disarmingly different?
i had no idea you'd been holding onto it all this time haha, i guess it was meant to be. you're more than welcome to keep it if you like.
really? so i don't even need to write a resignation letter?
i still can't believe it. the whole report reads like a bad joke -- it's simply unimaginable.
hehe, at ease, soldier! for the time being, at least, we are in peace time.
but like i mentioned earlier, we're in a bit of a bind -- we could really use a helping hand.
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
you took your time. i was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, miss "sole of the deep."
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
yes. what is making her so nervous?
it's a pity that theofan got away. but knowing which harbingers are still looking at liyue is something. it gives me a starting point for my next mission.
i haven't seen him for a while i hope he's grown up a bit since then.
no, we don't want to cause you any trouble, of course.
could the clearing of the fog be related to this device?
ei, you're thinking about this all so conscientiously. i've only got as far as wondering whether i'll be able to sell entrance tickets to the grand narukami shrine in the future.
besides the macaroni, i should also pick up some tomato sauce
it's your home, after all, you should be the one to shape it!
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
i don't know much about the grand bazaar, but i do know that the residents here have a penchant for song and dance heh, two things that the akademiya doesn't particularly approve of.
i disagree. each new day and each new year is different from those that have come before. how long will you simply let them pass you by?
her power was already on the decline. then you dealt her that fateful strike.
what was that all about? you're one hundred% certain we're gonna find those robots for him?
i know mister svarog. he isn't affected by other people's wishes. he only follows logical judgments.
so, they hired a group of experienced guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.
heh, i'm only telling you this so you can properly understand my plan. could you possibly spare the sentimentality for the time being?
mm-hmm. the object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the gnosis and the prototype puppet is now known as "the balladeer."
that means you also have a good head on your shoulders and the ability to learn rapidly.
you can display it at home or hang it on your wheelchair. it'll cheer you up.
err, maybe the corps of thirty just didn't have anyone available? or maybe someone recommended us? i've never given it too much thought
but no disguise can mask the stench of blood. just from their suspicious looks, i bet they do dirty work like kidnapping or assassinations.
well hello there, little one. oh? i see you've brought a special guest.
in the hands of a professional businessperson, the kind of information you will be exposed to would be worth well, tens of millions of mora.
then you look towards the sky and release the kite to soar among the clouds.
wow, this market is even busier than the one in port ormos.
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
well, never mind. what about one of you, then? anyone who can defeat me, takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new tenryou commissioner.
is this "jeroney" you mentioned one of your brothers?
no matter where he is, he will transform into a soft breeze and return to his homeland.
good night. try not to stay up too late
it's okay it's not like i even know what she looked like
we didn't find anything directly related to the museum thefts, but there was one thing worth noting
okay. well, see you soon, then.
to put it into short-life terms -- a funeral. you see, for long-life species of the xianzhou, death has always been a distant, mystical concept.
himeko and mister yang still have to participate in social networking. being an adult sure is hard.
so, it seems that some borisin have returned to stargazer navalia in disguise. the answer seems quite obvious
of course, the other brigade members were just like him. their ruckus would go on night after night
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
this inazuman machine could well be something that dodo-king left here for us to find and activate.
she showed genuine concern for me when we first brought up the topic. i can't repay her kindness with doubt and suspicion.
get hurt? why would i? don't underestimate me.
no, it's still worth exploring. i'll go and take a look first.
hmm, maybe some of your neural circuitry is less intact than i thought
get hold of the stellaron before cocolia realizes what's happening!
hehe, you should prepare yourself. i certainly won't go easy on you.
"the marechaussee hunter says nothing in response to that question."
then in comes a bunch of outlanders in strange clothes who gawk and run around everywhere
easy not so much. we can't restore the ley lines without the lord of the night, and i'm not sure she has enough power to do it on her own.
let me introduce you to robin. she woke up from ena's dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
i mean, we needed an excuse for your behavior anyway surely insanity counts?
based on what you said, even if i should wake up, these wounds that caused my death will remain on my body and never heal?
yes, but what made you ask that all of a sudden?
good work, everyone! we're looking to wrap with our two main ladies today. i can already smell our success, hehe!
quick, back to the energy supply hub. anyone that tries to stop us is gonna find out a thing or two.
hah? hold up, he's back? that can't be, he was still in the city a little while ago
mister reca is so amazing. he convinced the family so easily.
he was the same way toward me and amber at first. as we gradually got to know each other, he started acting more naturally.
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way)
yes, she needs to know about this now.
my apologies, i have a lot of business to attend to at present -- i won't be joining you. good luck recovering the stolen items.
hahaha, don't worry about her. she may look tiny and helpless, but she's been through just as many battles as the traveler here.
why wouldn't i? you've gotta be self-reliant down here. watch, you might learn something.
in that case, before passing judgment, you should first become a better dancer than me.
i didn't expect her to be so open-minded and she didn't even try to persuade me to stay. she didn't summon me just to return the guitar, did she?
we predict their next move, and we take them down.
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
ah, right. i knew about that even when she was still my subordinate.
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
it has a charm that i can't quite put my finger on. i think i'm slowly beginning to understand what drives adventurers to go in search of unknown places.
it'll be fine. even if the sky collapses, we have the master diviner with us to hold it up. oh, and now we have the general here too.
so the past still weighs heavily on your heart?
until our next meeting. may my songs gift you with pleasant dreams.
i just want to take a look at the weapons and talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
you should take this opportunity to rest, lord phainon the coreflame ritual is tomorrow.
anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much aeur" it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
okay, let's see what there is.
thank you all so much! your understanding and support make me feel a lot better.
eh? that's weird i pressed the button already. i wonder what went wrong
how was it? did you dream of me?
baishi has always been very passionate about her work. i can leave any task in her capable hands and rest assured that her performance will be nothing short of exemplary.
oh, probably because it was the theater asking.
always on the hunt for more followers
unfortunately, the remembrance doesn't lie what we just saw is the "reality" that happened -- and it won't fade from our minds just because we wake up.
i admire your confidence. but what was it you said earlier about declaring a winner before swords were drawn?
so it's made up? what's the point of that? without being grounded in reality, how can the story be believable?
naturally, for anyone looking to make a profit in a complex market, the bottom line is having the requisite experience and expertise. all i can do for them is share whatever insight i may have.
if possible, please inform the general and arrange for me to meet with the marshal. maybe this body of mine can help the alliance get one step closer to the xianzhou's enemies.
what do you know about this dog, thoma? everyone knows how well-connected you are.
yes. the reconnaissance company is tasked with patrolling this route during the festive period
had it been the case, then knowing how the fatui operates, they would have left some evidence of it.
yeah ahem, i mean, not too much, actually.
by reading our minds and showing us what we want, it creates the reality that we want to be true everything it does is either to get us to lower our guard or to wear us down.
because i had just severed ties with a lifelong companion.
i would certainly feel at ease here, whether it be while reading or working.
thanks to them, inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. there is no need to state your name. just be off with you aeur" do not distract me from my performance.
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
"miss serval" clara is such a well-mannered kid! meanwhile, the architects' children are still calling me "auntie" and making me feel old
i see. but when it's so obvious, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
i'm sorry, my dear. my dream dance partner i've already got sights on someone else.
ah! i shouldn't be talking about this. pretend i never said anything.
you're right. it seems she really hasn't considered anything.
although some basic options should include meal for one, meal for two, and family meal.
he didn't lie about the weapon being one of chartonus' handiwork, though. thanks to its inscription, i now have a fairly good guess of the time period we're in.
i have to admit that these little ones born in the process sometimes move me.
hmm maybe i should implement some of our scout strategies
what i take from these stories is not so much the content itself, but what they represent in terms of the effects of time upon inazuma.
you think so? i thought i was rather accommodating. if it had been the shogun she would have decapitated kujou kamaji without a second thought.
looks like the second round is over. i wonder who was faster, kaveh or madam faruzan? huh? where's madam faruzan?
alright, that's enough small talk. i've got things to do, seriously
an interesting answer. but if you ask me, i think all emotion shall ultimately return home to the heart, and slowly settle with the passage of time.
ms. rekhar and miss najia made and assembled the centerpiece.
if i had to pick something, i guess i'd like to explore this place thoroughly.
monologues aside, there's still plenty of work to do to get the alley back on track. the dock still needs your help.
strange is this also the work of the heliobus?
this place is the rift between dream and reality. a place reserved only for those who have awakened from ena's dream.
well, i was really hoping you would say that such sacrifice could at least be used as some leverage in our negotiations.
you can't work your way out of writer's block! a short break is a good way of refreshing the mind.
that narrow device it seems to be a buoy.
during that time, all children of the appropriate age in both the overworld and the underworld will be tested. in the end, only one child deemed as "worthy" will be chosen.
that's just the work of my subconscious mind
is there a particular topic that you wish to discuss?
am i right, mister lyney?
"the express has lots of express friends, and it wants to find them and play together."
(or perhaps i'm still not fashionable enough? but that can't be, right? ugh, don't tell me they're still getting the impression that i'm super old-fashioned)
come on stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
also, consider this: you have to have the naganoharas, because so many people are emotionally invested in the existence of fireworks.
if i'd known there were so many high-tech wonders on the express, i probably would've insisted on going with you guys.
i figured you would have at least brought a few people along for appearances' sake. it appears i underestimated just how confidential the mission was.
in the end, oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the underworld.
that outsider looks weak, but is pretty brave. if he weren't on the xianzhou and hadn't met me, he'd totally get robbed just for lugging such a huge case around.
the past and present of the sky-faring commission do not have such a simple relationship. the events of the past crafted its current greatness.
don't be surprised. my job is just to help everyone make the right calls.
i look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, mister lyney and miss lynette. that's enough for now. toodle-oo~
that part is true. i'm always calculating when it comes to business, but never with people.
oh, sorry. whatever the boys were talking about must have been so boring that i spaced out.
zubayr theater is our reason for coming together. it connects us all in unique ways.
a memory zone of this level is mere child's play to a memokeeper. come on. let's head out through the front door.
you flatter me. this is a sky-faring commission affair, yet the two of you had to put yourselves in harm's way. i am ashamed.
sure you don't want my help? c'mon, it's a great deal: cook twice the amount in the same time!
clara said she was going to find components, right? let's start with nat's storage room.
but i guess you do have a point we haven't uncovered the whole truth yet. we still need to figure out his exact actions and reasoning for these last few years.
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
he entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. if that's the case he should have seen everything that happened here
sincerely, beidou, you misunderstand me. i have many simple pleasures aeur" i take a stroll through yujing terrace and one down by the harbor every single day.
this data bank is quite interesting.
if it can deepen your understanding of our trials and tribulations, it will have fulfilled its purpose.
this is something from when i was a child.
don't look at me like that. i've never had to tinker with the shogun before, and she's very complicated. it's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
anyway. i'm only telling you this to stop you worrying, so that you can focus on something i need you to do for me.
i know. if i hadn't joined in that plan with you, i wouldn't have come up with this idea.
perhaps not. but you should be.
there are quite a few curios on the express that i've only seen in the catalogs, though i'll need to see them up close before i believe them...
pascal, i'm going to change your shell. don't worry, it won't hurt
i've thought about it, and well, if i were bronya, i wouldn't sign it.
hehe i assume you're hoping to take back a few moves.
hehe, i think it sounds great. i'm counting on you guys!
we are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
in the past, overworld soldiers on the front line would lose their lives in droves, and yet the fragmentum's advance would remain unaffected.
still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
clara, we'll help you investigate what's going on with the robots.
thinking back, that trip to see the void song whales was one of the turning points which set me on the path to becoming a fighter pilot. life truly is full of wonders
then, i'm sure you know there are those who question whether it actually occurred.
gepard brother. surely now you can see the need for pragmatism?
as far as i can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
hah, then it's mere flattery you pick your moments to wisecrack, don't you? now i don't know whether to take what you said earlier seriously
well? great view, right? i love coming here by myself.
come with me, ororon. we've got to find you a place to stay for the night.
thank you for your help, mister moze. we'll do our best to ensure your friend's safety.
then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.
hey, this is my job. the homayanis pay me, not you.
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
what's the hurry? don't get too close, or he'll see you.
on the contrary, i think it is those that i have known longest to whom i should extend the greatest courtesies.
sounds good! all you need to do to get to fontaine is cross this stretch of desert and navigate some waterways. knowing you two, i'm sure it won't be anything you can't handle.
hello, are you here for a bit of exalting sanctum scenery too?
well, the healer lady couldn't do anything about my condition. she just told me to "enjoy some tasty food."
you know me aeur" role-playing's one of my biggest strengths.
the guards lock the cell door and leave without looking back.
i'm not in the habit of napping at noon, but don't let that stop you if you're feeling tired. i'll give you a wake-up call in, say, three minutes' time.
no, it seemed more sportsmanlike than that.
glowswather you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
we worshiped idrila, the aeon of beauty. we vowed to guard their beauty with the sword, but one day they suddenly disappeared.
now you know why there are no incomplete ones among the abominations
welcome to bonajade exchange, radiant feldspar branch.
allow me to introduce my assistants to you. they help me take care of business at the workshop.
to reach scrivener hall, we must take this elevator and go through the frozen prison.
what i mean is i hope you enjoy yourself here.
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
phainon steers his own fate.
as for me i don't mind trying my hand at the trending games from time to time, though i still prefer chess.
if i don't do something about them, then even my brigade or the people of aaru village could become their next target.
precisely! heh and i'm not even the hydro archon anymore, so all my power is gone anyway.
if you had no intention to trespass, then why did you return to the xianzhou ship before your exile was lifted?
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
mm-hmm, i picked the venue especially for you aeur" a humble local eatery called kiminami restaurant.
but is this nation worth existing for eternity?
it'll be fine -- we have other people in the underworld working on the investigation too. besides, we don't have any clues yet, so we may as well do something useful.
but i've never left sumeru city before, so suddenly being taken to a new place is
sorry to disappoint. the "absolutely not module" has been enabled, so not even i get to bypass its permissions. whoopsie.
i also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver beidou's message. here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
but without a doubt she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. it's like aventurine said just then. it's best to keep your distance from her.
one slogan to end them all.
yes, the little fella is alive and well again. it's just that some parts aren't completely back to normal yet.
let's see if we can find any clues here before we plan our next step.
i've been reminded of many people, too. kitsune saiguu, makoto, and all the other friends who i watched pass even further back.
i received my vision when i debuted on stage. if even the goddess was willing to watch my performance, then that must mean she had acknowledged the beauty of human-made art.
i hear she works for that's life magazine as well. she's young, popular, pretty
from now on, no matter where you may go, no matter what hardships you may encounter as long as i am alive, the luofu will always be an open harbor to you
i'm guessing that's one of the prototype synthesizers. there may be a curio code on its base.
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
you know, it was difficult for me to believe you. some of the words you use are too alien for those that have lived their entire life in belobog.
yeah, it hurt. what, something you want to experience for yourself?
could it be the sword vessel in lipos' ballad? the one that chartonus crafted himself
even a judge knows her! her reputation sure does precede her
name your price. you deserve that much.
a response that lacks embellishment. you have no misgivings about the friction or suspicion that your answer might cause. a step will not be recorded.
this is an arduous mission, and i must heed the voices of all to determine the best candidates for this campaign.
yep, but in the part you heard, he hadn't become the first sage yet. there's more to the story
at this rate, by the time the qingxu pool redevelopment plan is ready to roll, they'll be the technical backbone of the team.
haha, you make it sound so abominable. i'm just trying to get them to see the humor in it all.
come on, i need to look around a bit more before i can be sure
i didn't mean you had to be so formal about it. i need your actions, not your words, hehe.
barbara said that it's so rare for us to get a chance to come to an island, we should change into summer clothing to set the atmosphere.
oh, um, i i don't think that will be necessary
of course, i didn't want to make things too difficult, so i spun you a broad web wasn't that nice?
we meet again, distinguished guests.
human life is short. enjoy it while it lasts.
well, you see we are the ones that owe an explanation. if we keep putting off the meeting, it could easily result in the problem escalating, right?
clorinde is right, though. you really are reliable!
(now that i think about it, it's a good thing i found some helpers this time. some things are best done with the help of friends.)
to me, this work is highly sensitive and of utmost importance, though i'm sure you will find it to be mundane at best. it would not surprise me if you can't bear the tedium or can't make the time
if a space telescope were deployed at this location on the express, it would almost certainly be possible to observe shorter wavelengths...
yes, i suggested to yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. a hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
how lamentable you are! please, bear with me for now. i vow to defeat evil ninja osaru and restore your ninja forms.
they go out drinking? this area isn't exactly renowned for the nightlife. i'm guessing it's a long trip to the nearest tavern?
i declare you my chamberlain. in other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the shogunate and loyal to me.
thanks for your hard work. is there any news from trianne?
of course, if there is a day when the underworld doesn't need a doctor like me anymore and everyone lives happily ever after
thank goodness we got here in time. if we'd arrived any later
i'm already very happy that i get to visit your express like this once in a while.
now that i think about it, that whole speech about magicians making things disappear was nothing more than a provocation, a bald-faced challenge!
idrisi and the others all used to say that they would quit if there was no mora to be had. but when it came to avenging my father, there was no mora to be made anywhere.
if you are to stay in okhema, you'll need a place to rest.
i i can't believe my ears! you are truly the bravest and most passionate people of sumeru, well, that i've ever met!
don't let her appetite for chaos fool you -- i think that kid's going places.
rahman, give me a few men to help us escort the village keepers back to the village. and these two scholars aeur" they're coming too.
yes, collei and i discovered a fairgrounds in the forest.
do you see two people standing by the door? they look like spitting images of each other. are they twins?
mister svarog's warnings about the potential risks do make me nervous.
don't look down on me just because i'm a new recruit~
remember, this is a race against the clock. a rare opportunity presents itself to you do not let somebody else snatch it from your grasp.
that door over there is the only way out we'd better close it
now that i think about it, perhaps i never needed to recommend that store to you in the first place.
the towns' resources have been swallowed up by the fragmentum. to get anything now, people have to risk their lives!
i don't think searching like this is the best way
there's always a way for me to contact him if i need to, so don't worry!
yeah. it may sound harsh, but uncle tian is past his prime. he's not cut out for this anymore.
go and rest. i will stay here and keep watch.
it was a fair match, so no one's to blame. actually, we should be grateful to you -- they were so impressed by your abilities that they said they want to train harder.
sorry huohuo, i didn't think it through. you were never a burden.
i already have something in mind. let's pay sara a visit at good hunter.
alright, never mind. so how about what they said aeur" do you remember their exact words?
you do not wield your sword for yourself, but to protect those you serve. there's nothing special about a blade. it's the intentions of the wielder that matter above all else.
how high and far a kite can fly depends as much on the weather conditions as on the skill of the person holding the string.
huh? can't we just bring some desserts? like the fontinalia mousse?
she's been guarding aaru village for quite some time now. if anyone is qualified to question the offenders, it's her.
go ahead and give it a try, little layla. don't worry, the little ones and i will be here to keep you safe.
the specifics, however, will require further investigation. this will take some time
just remember to come back often. make an appointment in advance with asta or arlan so i can make time to study you.
well? you may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
the cocolia i knew would sit on the roof and listen to my songs, but not the supreme guardian.
great! i look forward to learning from your culinary expertise.
these people they send me the most extravagant gifts
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
look for another -- every platform linked to the gear bridge should have a similar terminal.
i mean it literally. i sense your burning desire to live, but unfortunately, you don't have anything of equal value to offer.
darn, how could they all be empty? now even the monsters are gathering supplies?
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
huh? you just said you didn't wanna complicate things for me, and now you're sending me on a mission
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
if you're dizzy, sit and rest for a while.
oh? so, you do know what kind of place this is
don't let him fool you. everyone in the underworld knows that this brat is a no-good thief. if i remember correctly, even the clothes you're wearing came off another kid's back?
not there. come back.
you don't talk like a cook, you sound more like a tv host or something.
from the sound of it, it seems like you're asking me to leave penacony.
am i really that important to someone? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories
those travelers who came seeking hanguang's swords all came in the name of justice and honor.
that's right. both mercenaries and warriors heavily rely on muscle memory. only knowing the theory of battle won't get you anywhere.
if he had taken the time to read the decree, it's unlikely he ever would have ended up in this predicament.
you may have been blinded by fame and fortune in the beginning, but your actions during the final battle had proven you to be a true marechaussee hunter.
shoot, they're blocking the way forward let's get rid of them.
she stares at the screens. is she looking at herself in the mirror? ...what does she mean by "try again"?
so, i believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
mister svarog helped to format pascal and integrate him into the base network, but after that
you see broken iron swords scattered all around you and downed trees riddled with terrifying claw marks.
qlipoth the preservation is known for their indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
makoto's gaze was always fixed on the people of inazuma. i always assumed it was because that was her duty.
let's start with the city's surroundings. we might be able to gather some clues by listening and observing.
plus, this is the family's turf. teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
not so long ago, i was still wondering whether i'd ever see belobog's sky again. now, i'm on a train coasting through the universe
she had their utmost trust, admiration, and love and she truly deserved it.
well, it'll take a while to tell.
would you mind giving us the photo? we're trying to piece together clues from that time.
such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
n--no need, bronya! you're a supreme guardian now. don't let a little thing like this
uh well, let's leave that for now and head back to wangsheng funeral parlor. this big g matter is very closely linked to meng.
the express? shouldn't you be asking himeko instead?
after all, we need to watch you practice for a few days before we can figure out how talented you are, right?
hmm? wait a moment, child. you're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
candace and i bumped into these two while we were strolling through the streets.
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise
then allow me! as a streamer, i've done my fair share of research. let me find my script
oh? is the chef from liyue? from liuli pavilion or xinyue kiosk, perhaps?
traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
enough. don't use that nauseatingly fawning tone on me!
but mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
even the toughest long-life species would have a hard time enduring this.
this is barbara, the deaconess of the church. she is here to retrieve the holy lyre der himmel.
even if you wish for it... i can't promise you anything.
it's okay. i find it quite interesting. i didn't realize that this was how ordinary people viewed the shogun.
unsheathe your swords and get ready, miss march! the duel starts now!
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
so think hard about what that means. and then think again about what you hope to achieve by arguing with each other.
hmm why won't it
alright, it's getting late. let's talk once we're home.
go on, take them. i'll thank the stars for you later.
up till now, the almighty shogun had my full support. but now that she's been eliminated from the tournament in truth, i don't really care.
isn't one of the joys of playing chess to continually learn and progress through a complex set of rules?
a fresh catch can go straight on the grill with minimal preparation and it tastes delicious, even with no seasoning.
what's going on? why is it getting hot in the memoria?
sakujirou and keisuke can't turn back the clock in their relationship, but that's no reason to live with remorse.
we soon became the most elite fighter pilots of the sky-faring commission. it wasn't an easy life you could even say it was a cruel one.
i need to go home to fetch my grandfather's notes. let's meet at wanmin restaurant later.
and, in my dream, someone spoke to me. they said: "you are the fairy of the forest of blessings. now go, save the forest with your magic."
it's like that party game that the people of the yaoqing love to play: they hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
(a shame? i mean, if you ever miss this whole telepathy mess, i could always share my senses with you again.)
clara had already arrived at the storage room by the time we got there. we split the painkillers with her.
um i don't think that's how it works
but if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then i hope its existence proves to be real.
the man regards you with doubt and concern. after a period of inner struggle, he lets out a long sigh, and informs you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
lady guuji. here i am, as promised. rest assured i came here alone and told no one about this trip.
as you approach, an ominous aura surrounds you. you get the sense that your enemy is close at hand.
i never knew the fateometer even determines the amount of damage you inflict if you get unlucky, isn't it just game over right then and there?
a long time ago, i also spent some time studying at paperfold university. so, i can be considered an alumnus of the school.
huh? don't move. there's something here.
alright, let's each take a road and herd those scattered guards back into one place. make sure to attract their attention. isak will be the key.
i have recorded all the clues you provided, mister limestein. thank you for putting your trust in the silvermane guards. we will keep you informed if there are any developments in the investigation.
on second thought, since you're right here, i must ask you one more question: where is cipher?
mechanics, research, and music are all things i'm pretty good at, wouldn't you say? but i guess making money's not on the list
we could come knocking on their door on the grounds of a search warrant, but if the investigation were to come up empty, i'm afraid tensions and distrust would only increase.
tsk, tsk, little pawn, must you force me to intervene directly? i'm loath to flout my philosophy of destruction.
i knew it no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
ha! i finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. oh, i must say it feels good.
i think little gui's talents would go unappreciated in a lot of settings being a street performer is her true calling!
let's focus on igniting the braziers first.
sure sounds like it. i could only dream of having a cozy job like that.
fine, fine, i suppose haste is warranted. lead the way!
no need to be humble, you took great risks for the xianzhou. i saw what you did.
you will see me appear once again as i have done today aeur" only next time, my blade will show no mercy.
take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss
the verdant knights followed the route you mentioned and discovered the wreckage of the whistling flames ship. unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo.
because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
hmph, so he told the truth after all. he is actually leaving sumeru.
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
shouldn't it be the audience who decides if a show is intellectual or enlightening? why is someone from the akademiya judging that?
you've already met junkichi and shigeru.
i'm guessing that her sudden illness made her feel like she may not be able to realize her dreams anymore. it also made it difficult for her to hold onto the happy memories and dreams she had.
put a watermelon parfait in herta's office and stephen is sure to show up. remember, the pumpkin ones will never attract him -- those are for warding him off.
yes. the truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, baal and beelzebul.
everyone seems so devoted to the troupe. i'm sure if you keep chipping away, you'll find a way through.
it's the weirdest thing. i remember i was reading a book at the grand bazaar, and then i guess i must have fallen asleep at some point, because well, then i woke up dressed like this
this notice seems like a hint for us from miss sparkle.
aaru village is not a big place. outsiders stand out here like a sore thumb. i'd bet word about you has already gotten out.
i want to do something special for you in return for all the help you've given me.
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
then on to the next order of business -- let's discuss your companion, shall we?
alright then. let me get this straight. you're telling me that my body's already gotten used to this greatsword, but my brain just doesn't remember it?
it's hard not to get a little irked thinking about it.
yesterday's experiences make me stronger today. and most of those experiences are ones that i share with you.
this really took a lot out of me, though. i don't ever wanna do this again
huh? i wonder why? when we split up, she said she was heading home.
hmm i can't see any immediate problems looking at the individual entries.
i know that wildfire wants to talk to mister svarog but no matter how many times you talk to him, mister svarog won't change his mind
but, we still don't know how to use the magic of this world. we don't even know why the tavern closed in the first place
it's fine, mister skott. if you really don't want your cargo to be inspected, it doesn't matter.
thank you for the meal. i thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
please, do i look like someone who would fall for that sort of marketing trap?
looks like everyone's here. before we begin, why don't we finish where we left off yesterday? there was an important decision to be made, yes? i'll pour everyone a cup of tea.
i'm just a doctor -- there's not much i can do to assist you. these are medicinal pellets that the alchemy commission hands out to field doctors -- you might find them useful in an emergency. take them.
i suppose it can't be helped. i'll send the wounded back to inazuma city and dispatch an elite force here. you've already been a great help, please return to the city with us.
but our mission at yae publishing house is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. it would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
don't let it get you down -- you can share your feelings with others y'know? do you think keeping it all to yourself is doing you any good?
then i'll grant you even greater rewards.
oh, interesting! i wasn't thinking about it like that. i suppose it's not so different from an acting troupe, everyone has their own role to play.
although it'd still be a behind-the-scenes role, as tianshu, i wouldn't have the chance to get involved in anything truly clandestine or face any real danger.
our situation is grim. there doesn't appear to be a way out for now. we should be prepared to stay for a while.
no thanks. i'd prefer not to open it if only something terrible awaits. if anyone's going to find a way through, it's not going to be me.
if you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. have you made up your mind?
correct. scouts use up an enormous amount of energy in a single day. each meal, they eat enough to feed, hmm fouraeur"five normal people.
but i didn't think there would be this much left over. thank you, kaeya.
that would only be forcing people to watch something they don't like.
there are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward?
this isn't the first time they've come by. they had asked us several times in the past to improve the quality of our performances by only putting on shows they consider to be sufficiently intellectual.
you open your envelopes at the same time. the message reads
haha. no, i'm only the divine priestess of watatsumi island. i just like to read light novels and books about military strategy, divination's not my field.
exactly. madam yukong would never allow malicious competition. if we hadn't taught skott a lesson, the sky-faring commission would have done so anyway.
because i don't buy it, that's why. i don't believe for one second that we're gonna find the conqueror of demons by going through that door, so i'm sure as heck not gonna be the one to get us through.
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
easy now, layla. all that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. the bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
the traveler has done a lot for liyue in the past, and yanfei is a renowned legal consultant in liyue, so i can trust their intentions. as for you two
this is one aspect of the truth that i can share only with you.
it's been a long time since you last spoke with ping. and liyue harbor is always decorated so beautifully during the festival period
i'm not sure. a complete reconciliation may also not be the best thing for them right now.
lyney asked me to wait here for you, remember?
yes. i don't know whether it was the sages or lesser lord kusanali who came up with the idea.
it's settled, then. traveler and paimon, please go get some rest. i'll go find you in qingce village when i'm done.
keen observation. they share the same fundamental logic, and are pretty much identical in that regard.
she specifically mentioned that if you wish to buy anything at the inn, be it food or otherwise, just let the innkeeper know. the commission will cover the cost.
the training's not over yet. the part prepared by cloud retainer is only the first trial.
ah traveler, paimon, you made it. did you rest well yesterday?
since you're so curious, i'll give you the whole story.
cyno forced him to release lesser lord kusanali. he has no choice but to obey.
it's clear to me that i'm not the only one holding this belief aeur" i'm sure my ancestor had similar views.
the place you are going to is called rivet town. follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
so i want to draw up a training schedule for you and march!
my lady, this isn't about mora.
i've already prepared seats for you. come, sit beside me.
screwllum will stay on the space station for a while longer. he and herta still have problems they need to solve. as for me, i'm leaving soon and won't bother with goodbyes.
is that so? i'm afraid you're just overthinking things.
it was probably sent to the inn that we're staying at.
pascal's consciousness does not appear to have returned to the level shown in the diary
there's nobody else at the scene. seems like miss sparkle used the same method to "send" dreamers back to reality let's talk to those two there then.
well, ipc staff are free to come and go, as long as they don't break any laws.
i see... you've also had a similar experience? then you should know that this me and your memory of me are not the same person.
the captain of the guards reluctantly allows you to assess his condition. right as you're trying to get a closer look at his leg, your hand slips, and collides against his wound with great force
experiments can always be repeated, but humans cannot be brought back to life.
why would you think that? i've never harbored any ill intentions well, not when you were around, anyway.
now i just need to take care of the confidentiality issues. hehe let's hope our friends from overseas can keep their mouths shut, for their own sakes.
and yet, you were able to retrieve three of the four keys if i remember correctly, each was entrusted to a respected and capable hunter how did you manage it?
the ability to look into others' memories sounds like something that could easily be misused. luckily, you're the one wielding it.
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing
i firmly believe that with the determination of everyone, our world, the world the trailblazers call "jarilo-vi," will no longer be alone among the stars.
hush now, keep quiet. this is my moment to shine, so just listen.
the new jade chamber is missing many of the contents held by its predecessor.
come on, step forward and strike with the sword in the most natural way you can think of! it's important for us to grasp your natural movements, so we can decide where to start and what you need to learn.
you can stop gathering parts for the time being. just stay here and wait for us to return and give you your next orders, alright?
it was almost like a performance. we took the stage and put on our best show.
i knew exactly what he was doing. and, yeah, if i ever did share my memories with someone, i guess that person would be a friend. but, it never got to that point.
is it just me, or has he accepted the goddess's prophecy?
what are you staring at me for? go on, go get on with your cooking.
you're on duty, soldier. stay focused!
well, i was sure worried about her after she disappeared, pela's workload doubled -- she said she barely had time to go out.
mister farhad and mister hushang visit even when there isn't a show going on, and they always tell us lots of entertaining stories.
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
all the shots had great composition, and i could really feel a connection to the characters and their lines
the destruction? i don't understand
*sigh* it's been such a long journey, but now we're finally gonna meet some cloud knights! i'll be back with my unit!
the results of insight checks aren't disclosed to the players, so i'll be the one consulting the fateometer.
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
stargazer navalia may have come to a standstill, but the alarms are operational how did she get through here?
then, your parents told me what happened between you when you were younger. once i'd heard the story, i realized that the firework meant something special to you both.
have you not sensed it yet? this apparent land of dreams it's a carefully designed dream maintained by the family through unknown means.
see? see? how can you compete with me? i'll teach march seventh the essence of zhuming swordplay, so she can win the contest with my sword skills.
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
as far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. they complemented each other, and they ruled inazuma jointly. so there was no need for the public to know the truth.
by personal request of the committee, a discussion session will be added to allow all participants to raise and answer questions.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance
it's been ten years, jemma. aren't you tired of the grieving widow act? i think it's time to put an end to it.
i'm the least accomplished in swordplay, but i came out unscathed. i really ought to thank my masters for taking all the blows on my behalf.
didn't little yanqing claim that he was going to give up being the ringmaster and go on the hunt instead? help shoulder the general's burdens?
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
actually, i have another selfish motive i want to prove to cocolia that i was right. once we've taken care of the stellaron maybe she'll go back to how she was.
we've only met once. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
whoa! you're so patient -- you really peeled off all the layers!
before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
things are getting more amusing by the second.
if someone starts getting under your skin, you just yell right back at 'em. if that doesn't put an end to it eh, then you just challenge 'em to a fight.
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
i think it's an amazing idea! who knows, if we take more pictures, they might even become the signature souvenir of the grand bazaar.
to which i replied: "don't bother. ningguang has no time for suck-ups."
i don't think that was included in the job posting. actually, i don't think there ever was a job posting.
(he changed the topic without batting an eye! good thing i'm prepared.)
the call is yours. we still have time to re-shoot an ending if that's what you'd like.
but these problems disappeared all but completely after the battle against osial.
with you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
hey thanks for your concern. you should head back to the town, and i'll do the same when oleg and i are finished.
when the abyss first began to corrode the ley lines, they took every opening they could get.
before i left inazuma, many people heard that i was looking for a meteor shower, so they told me that they wanted to make wishes.
if the difficulties are purely financial, then there must be a solution. you could put the shows on pause while you look for a sponsor, for instance.
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
sushang is very kind and comes to my shop every day to ask: "is business difficult? i'll help you!" "did anyone smash your shop? i'll help you!"
i used to be terrified of the gaze of other people, especially when they had suspicion or resentment in their eyes.
you make a good point though. i should drop by more often in the future. that way, they won't get so bored.
i prefer to let actions speak louder than words.
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
i was wondering if this troupe is so important to all of you, why does it have to disband?
hmph, you do it next time -- i'm tired of being the villain.
that's right, we're investigating something that happened recently.
so how about it? will you join me?
so, not only do you think i have a bad temper, but you also think he's ugly?
it doesn't have to be like that. i'm willing to answer all your questions, but not right now... if my cover hadn't been blown, we might have had more time, but at the moment, we don't have any other options.
mister svarog chose not to get rid of it. isn't that the most convincing proof?
the answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
may the best swordmaster win.
i've troubled you enough already. i can handle the rest of this matter myself.
hmmm i say that's a good title. what does everyone think? alrighty then, it's decided.
i think it means "beard" or something. believe me, it's a really stupid name i've found it insufferable for years.
however, i have visited those planets.
well, i mean, he's sitting in a jail cell. like yanfei says, everyone who breaks the law has to pay the price.
a... note? looks like instructions from the butler for the other servants.
well whatever they are, they're not good enough.
besides, if i'd waited until my brothers were finished trying to out-polite each other, the food would've gone cold.
oh? did you want a tour of exalting sanctum? hee-hee
i brought you guys here, and i'm standing with you till the end!
i bet the letter's at the reception desk. i'll go check later.
a space station, but that's not important.
i said, why haven't you left?
what are you afraid of? surely you don't think that aurelie's story is unworthy of the grandest stage in fontaine?
since this definitely won't be your last escapade, here's a little tip you should at least make it look like your room and things are still in order when you leave. also, you'll need someone to cover for you when you're out and about.
but i am capable of discerning right from wrong, and i deeply understand what "freedom" means to the people of mondstadt.
you have a very distinct scent. losing one sense forces the other senses to become sharper.
trying to change mister svarog's mind on my own would take forever. even if i kept trying until i was all grown up, i don't think i could do it.
i'm making early preparations for what is to come.
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off
finding balance is an essential concept in liyue culture.
barbara is a hard worker, but i feel she's too hard on herself sometimes what? you ask me how i know all of this? it's because the order also manages the church.
mercs camping in the wild rely on banners and weapon racks to protect themselves.
i know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
in the past, our people have been subjected to lengthy interrogations on arrival in watatsumi, and the same has been true for your people on arrival to narukami.
delicious. i've already memorized the recipe.
wonderful. it would be an honor to serve as adviser for our young mage.
if you like, i can give all of you a small private show any time.
*sigh* you did save my life at cloudford consider this my returning the favor.
the lawrence clan is just like this stage. it was once home to glorious performances, but those days are now long gone, and it is time for the stage to be updated.
i can't say i blame you -- we're nothing alike in personality or interests.
defeating signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
i i guess we do.
uh, not the best time?
one who seeks the way of the ninja is a ninja initiate. one who upholds the way of the ninja is a ninja. and one who lives by the way of the ninja is a ninja hero!
well, you can still sign up. the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
promise me to never tell the people of okhema about the worlds beyond the sky, no matter what may happen.
thanks for stepping in, general feixiao. otherwise, i'd have had to knock them out with my incense.
for my part, i did my utmost to fulfill the duties of a responsible adult.
don't worry, mister svarog. i'm fine.
huh? is there anything you'd like to share with us, mister bolai?
glad to be traveling with you again, miss black swan.
i don't need anything, either! so long as you continue to request my international courier services from komaniya express, we're golden!
those choices may be correct and far-sighted, but we are, after all, flesh and blood, and we cannot help but agonize over the process of making them.
what!? no! no, no, no -- can't you see i'm just short of hands here?
hold on over there, is that
well, well this is not what i was expecting
hehe, that's for sure. and you know what? the way i see it, the museum's reopening is a very significant event and worth remembering more than any other time in the past.
memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
i also have something i wish to discuss with the merchant guild, but i'll wait for you to finish.
sadly, i can't. too much work on the space station.
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
hey, have you been watching me while i'm not looking?
if you require resupplying during your journey, you can always count on us.
more curious than my appearance is the fact that she and i don't see each other anymore, wouldn't you say?
i was completely moved by what she had said, so i started taking dance lessons from her. and later on, i began to dance here in her stead.
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair
the antagonists? you mean all the people who behaved foolishly? what can i say, they're bad people and they all got what they deserved. end of story.
knight klee, your request for leave has been approved.
and the one hundredth vision bearer in question the one who will have their vision seized, i fear is thoma.
confidence goes a long way.
"your name shall be padisarah. may you bloom in this world as beautifully as the flower i love."
you mean you also want to discuss something important with me?
her parents used to be artisans in the commission, so i think she has some nostalgic connection to the place.
perhaps someone you've met or something you've experienced here. or perhaps you enjoy the atmosphere of liyue and you will become accustomed to it.
why don't i just get this one called "kumquat curls"! curly orange hair, it's perfect for taking pictures and shopping!
leave your contact details with me. when i've completed my assessment of the pharmacology, i'll get in touch with you.
oh? if there's anything i can help you with, just tell me straight away. no need to hesitate.
something strange? can you share any details?
you must understand the situation you are facing.
mm yes, i eventually realized that i was overthinking things.
c'mon, i'll lead the way. once we're done watching the meteor shower, i'll accompany you home.
still, i'm happy to see that you approve of my culinary tastes.
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
she summoned me last night to tell me that you had deceived her. your identities and purpose here are counterfeit. you seek to overthrow the rule of the architects.
what you might not realize is that all too often people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
patience, young man -- we're not far from scalegorge waterscape. the mission the general tasked you with is about to come to an end.
just like how at this present moment, the virtues possessed by the both of you have turned into a warm current that pleases my skin.
in life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
as per our rules, any free-roaming heliobus must be sealed away. i was merely following protocol. besides, it was tail who requested this
i knew you would keep your promise, after all i'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days aeur" have you managed to get any sleep at all?
i'm glad that you're satisfied with the arrangements. here, take some time and get to know your surroundings.
i will, ganyu has always been a great asset to us. her health is a priority, so i will take good care of her.
but shrewdness is easily perceived as cynicism in the eyes of others. people come to think of you as someone who cares only about money, and not people.
argh! i've never seen this stuff before!
our memories don't just symbolize our past. they can also shine a light on our future.
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
not to mention, making incense is a labor-intensive process. you won't see anybody in the desert with the patience to make or sell something that requires that kind of effort.
um so, silent but deadly, let me know when you're ready and we can set off.
but when i'm with you, i'm now able to unwind.
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
if i didn't make any money in the morning, i'd have no food for lunch. i guess that's why i came to be so obsessed with mora.
i have high hopes for this journey!
some words are not to be passed on.
i'm curious about the express' trajectory. will it pass by the place i call home?
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
tighnari was first, and as for the second it's being discussed right now.
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
it's also essential to clean it often to avoid a buildup of dust, and it's best practice to hire a craftsman to perform regular maintenance
walk with me. let's forget our problems for a while.
humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. they cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
don't worry, i've trained myself to remember everything i hear.
a patient's medicine doesn't just reveal their illness. it also offers a window into their desires and needs.
miss serval is cool, strong, and carefree
alright then. i believe myself to be relatively well-read, but with stories like these, i don't even know where to start
i have much to contemplate in the days to come. but at least i can now see the way ahead.
in any case, mister boothill, it seems you've put your travels on hold after that incident too. are you enjoying your time in penacony?
allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
on the contrary, i apologize for allowing my own personal matters to encroach on your time.
i've been keeping tail here, all along
the venue is right over there. why not go and take a walk around? oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.
lady aglaea's contributions to okhema deserve more appreciation, but people mostly see her as distant and aloof.
yes. with some exceptions, but that is more or less correct.
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
but now, with hoolay's whereabouts unknown, everything is filled with uncertainty.
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
in the meantime i'm gonna figure out how to boost my victory rating. good luck!
the information about robin, firefly... and the other victims... i don't see any commonalities among them.
exactly right. the suspect is extremely cunning. she encrypted her transmission and timed her communication -- we couldn't pinpoint her exact location.
it's not every day we get this kind of opportunity. lyney thought it might be fun to spend some time in liyue, especially since it's lantern rite season.
as a netherworld dweller, i've already died once.
you made it sound like you were talking to those kids but you were talking to me.
their flimsy disguise has been exposed. even if they try to hide, there's no way they can escape us.
on the xianzhou zhuming, the judges cast those unforgivable and nearly immortal abominations of abundance into the eternal flames of the stars, reducing them to ashes.
well then i'm sorry, but what i'm about to say may simply come across as making excuses.
i'm sure, and i'm going. you know that i don't like to pass up any opportunity to dance, and this one is especially important.
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
i'll go play with gorou, instead. it's been a while since i've seen those fuzzy ears of his.
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
are we really going to eat that?
a debate? hmm well, scholars do love to use them to solve their problems, but how would that work in this case?
i can tell you what the future holds: if you don't go to the luofu, the stellaron will eventually contaminate the entire ship, and over half of the inhabitants will perish.
let me see slender fingers, but strong. this hand belongs to a killer.
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
you're talking weird again but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
all in black, surely they're not ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. now you're trying blame it all on me?
but i see what you're doing reverse psychology, huh?
maybe igor even attended the wardance. the xianzhou people have long lives, so it wouldn't be something that happened long ago for them.
why are the bad guys always using good swords why can't the bad guys take bad swords?
so, master dugu. have you heard of one by the name of zhiyi?
i hope you really give this a good shot, you and haniyyah. the future of this highly entertaining tournament depends on the decisions you make from now on i'm excited to see what you've got in store for us.
hmm? oh, it's the traveler and paimon and xiangling.
but aren't you--?
what if the responder is polka kakamond?
exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. fortunately, i've already managed to identify the author aeur" he's a failed light novelist named tomoyuki.
while you may be a ray of hope that fell onto amphoreus, you may also be a threat to amphoreus. you leave me no choice but to shut the doors of your fates.
hehe, but no one remembers that once the celebration starts. it's not like he can't also have some fun himself.
hey, don't you understand? you're currently the prime suspect for a major case! this isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
i know that they don't really exist, but i still enjoy believing in them. if someone came up to me and starting telling me to "stop being so stupid, they don't exist, nyah nyah nyah"
i'm going back to my dessert now. you all can keep discussing that on your own.
so you can definitely understand, why we want to be prepared.
i read them all, but only found one reference to magicaeur"
don't worry about it. take a rest, we'll be back right away.
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
how's your training going, shenhe? have you made any plans for lantern rite? we could spend it together in liyue harbor, if you'd like?
oh, you poor thing but you don't actually need to eat at all, do you?
we should probably get going. mister dvorak, could you come with me to confirm the site?
of course. i just didn't appreciate how nice it was at the time.
even if the same plot of soil is covered in flowers the following year, the one you remember won't be there.
(she already agreed to this. she wants to win, no matter what. me too.)
at least the choice is in my hands.
i'd like to see us try, haha they're extremely heavy. even with all of us, we wouldn't be able to move one.
you don't need to worry about little gui. she won't be able to sit still, even in a sick ward. i'm sure she'll come find you again in no time.
this is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
so your choice is?
great idea! shame we don't have any.
i'm here on behalf of the tenryou commission, of course. is that surprising?
good. how about you, little one? i trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
don't be upset, kaveh. sighing can carry away your good luck, you know.
and since the spirit is susceptible to erosion, she placed her consciousness inside her sword, where she remains in a meditative state, free from all disturbances.
now that this place is cleaned up, let's set everything in order and move on to the next zone.
we'll leave them be svarog may have blocked off the furnace core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. an admirable deed.
morning. you look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? what mischief were you up to last night, hmm?
at some point, she started going down a path that became increasingly difficult for me to join her on.
klee, where did you hide the treasure to begin with?
weird that's what the guide says
well, in roleplaying games, the story sometimes changes based on the decisions of the players and the results of the fateometer.
anyway. it sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see ei's less formal side.
at first glance, the weapons appear absolutely ordinary, but as you observe them, you notice a faint energy emanating from within.
qingni! where are you going?
really? huh, i heard that klee's bag almost flew away on the ride. if kaeya hadn't managed to quickly catch it, countless jumpy dumpties would have been thrown into the air.
well, defeating the dragon and the monsters should be straightforward enough but how do we fix the magic?
i understand. i shall become your shadow, just as you were once makoto's shadow.
mister zubayr, i've finished tallying things up here! well, except for the guests
his heartfelt efforts? i'm sorry sir, but i'm not sure i follow.
how was it? did you enjoy your time on campus?
on the contrary, we know it well.
what a nice day! let's go have some fun!
i told him to give up whatever he's doing, but he refused. he said they're just one step away from success, so there's no way he can back out now.
now you're bringing my great-uncle into this? baizhu just what are you planning this time?
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
you want to come as well? but you look quite tired.
while words can be deceiving, your gaze, your breathing, and your scent they reveal more than your words do.
it's certainly looking that way. apparently, every soul in liyue is now living under the creeping shadow of death, but so far, we are the only ones in the know.
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
i'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
yes, you can breathe easy now, phantom weasel.
we can only hope to learn the truth from one titan.
those stellaron hunters they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
since you've made it yourself, i guess having a little taste is the least i can do, haha
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning
patience. since the news made it out a few days ago, i have already had many people contacting me to declare an interest in joining the project.
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
it is against the law for a staff member to abuse their position to forge sales records and misappropriate goods!
so the one in this photo are you sure it isn't me?
finding the source of the corruption can wait. these puppets no longer have use now that i'm here. take them all out! defective goods ought to be sent back to the repair center!
we both came from the overworld. maybe that's why we're so eager to turn back the clock -- to return to when life below ground was no harder than life on the surface.
how did he do it? getting past all the guards with a limp, and sneaking in here to start a fire
i will practice more and seize victory next time.
if we ever have the opportunity, i too would like to play a match with you.
if you don't agree, i'll have no choice but to report everything back to "father." simple as that.
you'd be more likely to see me pulling up outside wanmin restaurant and selling grilled tiger fish from a food cart.
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
and what's more, there were plenty of suspects invited. do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that "black hole" you're wielding?
gorou, thank you for all you have done.
i received some intel just earlier today. someone said they found clues related to a gang of thieves in the underworld's robot settlement. i don't know if they'll lead us to the sculpture, but it's worth a try.
in fact, the name "baal" and the title of raiden shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up untilaeur"
i've never thought about leaving your theater, mister zubayr. i truly love this place, and i want to keep dancing here.
now that is an interesting question.
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete right?
my brother is still obsessed with anything remotely related to the "forbidden zone." but knowing him, it won't be long before we get more leads.
i can probably get through everything in two days. as long as i don't sleep.
the actions and desires of the nameless are always sincere. when dealing with you, the same sincerity is the most fitting price.
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me
one folktale even claims that the ancients found the stove god's shrine, but there was no statue aeur" only a huge, smooth slab of stone.
it's simple. that stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
if only there was a way for me to preserve this moment and show it to the kids back home.
anyway, sorry about the butterfly thing. with the way you suddenly came running over like that, i thought you were hired to take us out or something.
you must be one of the three goddesses of this world are you the goddess of creation?
the the emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
i hope you realize how lucky you are. if it was anyone else, i don't think i'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
please never do that again
and wouldn't that be more fun, too? better to show you the real exalting sanctum and introduce you to a true xianzhou pastime: celestial jade. aha
haven't i made myself clear? mister dongsheng, you've already been proven guilty of tax evasion. i just came here to see if you'd confess.
that's why we should care for the weak and support them as if their suffering were our own that's what the odes of harmony have always taught us.
in that case, it's unanimous.
back so soon? any news?
smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. that is how yae miko wages war!
how about we start with your name? now, should we call you misha? or
don't be upset klee there are many complicated situations in this world which don't always have a logical explanation.
more likely a natural occurrence. our weapons have had no effect on it.
proper path? do you mean, everything that happens in the metropole has been planned out since the very beginning?
fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
yeah, you need to be stronger than an ox to take life by the horns.
it was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. with regards to the annihilation gang i can also prove that what aventurine said was the truth.
i once saw one of our prop people make something similar. it looked really cool, so i took some time during my break to learn the basics. it's not a bad way to stave off sleepiness, either!
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
hmm, although kites are one of our most time-honored cultural relics, outside of their use in certain ceremonies, i suppose they're considered "playthings" more than anything now.
gifts must have an element of surprise -- just treat it as a part of life!
what do you think it was about the jade chamber that defeated osial?
it's no use, seele. she's made up her mind. i could tell from her expression.
as promised, i've delivered the child to you. our transaction is complete.
so, you're saying even though grandpa knew it was a cursed sword, he still chose it to be a prize because he thought it wouldn't cause any trouble?
big sis! let's go! i want to play in ever-hunt plains!
i'm going to head back and make some preparations. meet me outside the yae publishing house.
yes, the mara in you is temporarily suppressed. so long as you avoid over-stimulation and familiar faces, you shouldn't have a problem.
though bailu has been worshiped as the high elder since birth and had no say in this, her title of healer lady was indeed gained from her expert practice of medicine.
that's the most important outcome of this trip. to be honest, i wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when i lent you the pass permit.
i've seen a lot and it's made me think a lot i really can't praise it highly enough. i hope i will remember it for a long time to come.
no, mother would never do that to me there's no way she would.
for example, whenever a kite blew away, people would say it was the adepti that summoned the wind to take it away as an offering. that way, you can turn an unfortunate event into an auspicious one.
i should've known don't quit your day job.
if only i had a little more free time i'd love to take you around and show you everything we did to make the city look special during the festival.
you may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. i thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
more importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
could you repeat what you just said, yanqing?
(what does she mean, "onto something"? i certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
my real name is guinevere, but a xianzhou friend came up with an authentic xianzhou name based on the pronunciation.
she mentioned the cloud knights were at the alchemy commission -- i should find a ship and regroup with my unit. what about you?
common sense says my wallet should've emptied itself a long time ago. there's no way i wouldn't have noticed that.
come on, how could i possibly lose?
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it
i always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food hmm? you'd like to see me do that? hah! i'm sure you would.
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there)
zubayr theater exists for them for every single one of us!
another never-ending dawn. how bright is the day, and how long is the night.
i'm not asking you to point your spear at me. could it be that the abominations here aren't enough to motivate you?
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
we'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. there's a bit of time left before we jump. in the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
at this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire asdana system.
i don't know how to offer words of comfort, nor do i know much about curing others' ailments.
with all due respect, you don't honor your sword, so you don't deserve it.
it requires one to take their sword firmly in both hands and cut down the hopes and dreams of others even those of one's closest companions.
as the raiden shogun they revere, i should not be the one to hold them back.
i'm looking at the reply -- see, here. miss hanya said she's on her way.
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy it must mean we're doing something right.
good evening! i have a performance at zubayr theater tonight. want some tickets?
is that a promise? good. otherwise, i'm going to have to reconsider whether i want a librarian on patrol with me.
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control f--from the bridge, i mean.
and it's suspicious how they suddenly finished their "overhaul" and walked away as soon as they laid eyes on us.
i worry about her wandering around on her own, and i want to know what's been on her mind lately.
are you saying you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and is hiding something from us?
according to the intelligence, the suspect has already started reselling the statues near the festival venue. but he is lying low, and operating very discreetly.
someone hasn't been paying attention.
you know what? mister yang got me excited about it too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
both of you are new here, so it's only natural to be confused about the prophecy, titans, and chrysos heirs that have been mentioned in passing. but i'd like you to learn about amphoreus's history before i tell you more.
in danger? what do you mean?
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
i say that our powerful magician, mister lyney, is now the prime suspect for the serial disappearances case.
i see. it's not uncommon for merchants to be blinded by greed.
it is a pity that i can't help her retrieve her lost memories.
i won't go too far, and don't worry about me getting bored. i'm an expert at finding ways to pass time!
please forgive me, arlan.
or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? who knows, maybe i'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
together with norbert's mumblings about a "shopping street" i think all these clues are pointing in one direction.
every participant in this auction was hand-picked by me, based on certain intelligence.
perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
my companion blade has been taken away by the cloud knights. i want to bring him back, resolve this stellaron crisis, and clear our names.
and that's how the clash started. now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
if you have any other questions, you are welcome to come to himeko and me.
without a doubt, you aced it.
ah, i almost forgot. the ministry of civil affairs is hosting a kite-flying contest on the night of lantern rite.
i'm sure his grace doesn't consider the fortress to be outside the law.
don't you think the poetry and songs of the xianzhou people are enchanting? one time i asked shangshang to teach me to write poetry, and she only wrote four words in three months i don't think i'll be able to learn at this rate.
so are judges all loners? you don't seem to have any backup.
in that case, the vote stands at two to one.
...but to inspire them to save themselves.
to the south of here is port ormos, which seems to be where they're headed.
i don't think killing stormterror is the right course of action.
*sigh* i'm tired of packing. let's leave it here for today. thanks for your help.
hehe, to be honest, even though i've thought about it countless times before, i still haven't found an answer.
following those clues, i was able to finally locate the missing fireworks. but there was no sign of treasure hoarders.
welcome to reality. more specifically, the reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
anyway, people seem to be behaving in a very orderly fashion. i don't see the liveliness you spoke of anywhere.
if you don't spill whatever you're scheming against liyue
if i am not mistaken, what we just saw was a samurai's memory that was buried in the land.
meh, whatever. we have to get rid of them anyway. alright, stay close and try to avoid shattering to pieces!
"when you see it you'll scream!" that's so cliche, with the arrow and everything "failed your starskiff pilot test? you're cursed!" tsk, people are always looking for excuses
hah, there's plenty of precious stuff in here! you aren't looking for treasure in the museum while pretending to volunteer, right?
let's go. we have to find another path
isn't that a bit unnecessary?
ugh, where's the pin? is there anything those vagrants won't steal?
the sages have placed spies everywhere on the other side of the wall. i'll follow you as a bodyguard.
i understand, but i'm afraid it won't be an easy task.
nope. mister zubayr's really on top of everything.
that's true. i'd certainly hate to see anyone else try to con you.
me? hmm if this was before, i could have simply asked clorinde. but it's already been some time since i last talked to her.
perhaps the subsequent data will be able to tell us why he arrived on the xianzhou. we'll contact you if there are any new findings.
all i mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: you have to combine it with another print.
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
see you around, nameless~ try to stay out of trouble, especially the next time we meet!
i never knew the grand strategist of watatsumi island was a skilled negotiator as well as a formidable commander.
but i dared not speak. i could only gaze at him in silence until the moment i awoke.
is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
alright, alright, calm down. she'll be able to look after herself.
and before you say anything, there will be a next time. i know we'll meet again.
allowing the rite of parting to take place was also meant to buy some time for us to take control of liyue's administration
yawning without covering your mouth? uncouth. i will pardon your rudeness this time. good morning to you, too.
certainly! you can also tell my friend in yanshang teahouse about what they're up to. i'm sure my friend would also like to say hi to them.
all existing fragmentums are connected, so there will be monsters that will enter the space station through its fragmentum.
periodically stirring up trouble is part of their tradition entire buildings vanishing into thin air, puppet riots -- you get the picture.
but now, the youkai memories that leak from the ley lines are weak. they are no longer able to fly.
*sigh*, i told you it'd take a while to tell the story -- let's get back to the workshop first. by the way wanna help me pack my bags?
no. i will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. memokeepers don't need a dreampool anyway.
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
today is indeed a momentous day to have brought us all together. i propose that i treat everyone to a meal to mark the occasion, if it pleases you all?
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
the spells of the masters of the night-wind are all based on dealing with spirits, and so are all our problem-solving methods. so for spirit-duffers, even our healing methods don't work on them.
i make people realize that, no matter how hard they work, they'll never become a living legend like me.
although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. to me, this says you like to take care of it.
alright, alright. lady bailu, it's getting late -- you need to go home now.
you two being there would be the best gift of all! it'll also be a good time to introduce you to the rest of the theater.
it was nothing. anyone with a good head on their shoulders knows that skill and strategy ultimately determine the winner. in any case, it was an exciting match to watch.
if we ever need to expand the kujou clan residence, i'll be sure to find you.
ahhhh. it feels like it's been a long time since i've gotten so physical.
sorry i'll be sure to make it up to you.
wow, you can endure that much? truly, a heart of ice you've got there. hey, maybe we could actually get along?
yet here you are saying you want to "put an end" to one of the four winds of mondstadt?
but the truth is right here in front of my eyes, and i can't deny it.
is everyone ready? let's not keep them waiting.
now that i see you again, i realize your sword was right. it wasn't me who took your sword. it was you who lost focus.
of course i did. i cut my palm, and bled quite a lot. but master was not concerned. she just stood there and casually lectured me about itaeur"
i do not think that they'll strike again any time soon, so i shall stop following you. good day, all.
only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water
so far, so good. a classic tale. what happened after that?
thus, the current situation is that our fatui antagonist is still at large, has the two rogue commissions wrapped around their finger, and is distributing delusions from the shadows
i only lost because i was duped by her little tricks.
let's go to mingxing jewelry first, i need to pick up something before meeting them.
is that hesitation that i detect in your voice? so let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, i actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
sounds like you're starting to get familiar with the area.
pengyi, go back to liyue harbor and get the fireworks ready, then meet me in qingce village.
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
maybe that's why the trailblaze chose such a look.
i know, i'm sorry! just give me some more time, and i promise i'll plan the best trip ever for you.
go? go where? the luofu is under lockdown -- the cloud knights' operation isn't over yet.
still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
my lady has been very energetic lately and keeps taking me on hikes, staying out even into the night. by the time we get back, the receptionist is usually off napping on the job.
of course, everyone has heard of the vanquishing general, known to all, and unbeknown to none.
and that photo wall filled with the express crew's happy memories -- it's obvious that miss march loves keeping records of her life.
in their words, one gig sets you up for half a year. just one job like this nets them enough mora to take it easy for a while.
i have no doubt about general feixiao's capabilities, general huaiyan. i'm more concerned about the wardance.
ugh why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
but in my professional opinion i think there's a lot of potential here that's not really being fully utilized.
oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
anyway, the real issue is that dakan al-ahmar is led by my father, kusayla.
before you lies the city's central square. you see a man with a slightly anxious look on his face pacing back and forth, his head hanging low.
so, are they smugglers? what exactly are they up to?
tch the showmanship's not bad, i'll give her that.
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
so you made me go through all this effort to repair junjun just so you could sell him?
but the dance of sabzeruz is one of the key parts of the sabzeruz festival. if we can't perform it
but the shogun is still running based on her old rules. i can't allow her to make any more mistakes while i am working things out.
okay, we don't have time to really look into it right now. let's strike while the iron is still hot, and wrap this thing up once and for all.
hmm i didn't really give it much thought. but traveling with you bunch does always lead to unexpected surprises.
why, of course i do. allow me to take the first shot and break this case wide open. mister lyney is clearly lying.
nope. apart from this boring festival, i have no dealings with the man.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
so, you're planning to
that's easy for my grandfather to say, but this mission doesn't seem so simple anymore.
what am i gonna do why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish
ahaha, i must be the least ambitious person who's ever set foot in pardis dhyai.
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
there's no time to talk about this. the wardance has already started! if my guess is correct, the borisin will most likely use the ceremony to begin their slaughter.
i'm on duty. let's catch up later.
as for what the commission was about i guess some outlanders who were visiting sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.
that mister reca said i'm better suited for dreamweaver academy instead of charmony academy.
there may still be other treasure hoarders in the area. we should head elsewhere, just to be safe.
very good. it's essential for the kamera operator to understand the director's vision. i'll make my decision after seeing your work.
besides, if you were really so determined to end it all, you wouldn't have given us the opportunity to share our opinions. you think you're oh-so cold and ruthless, but i'm not buying it.
don't worry, my lips are sealed~
i'll roll the dice, and the score decides who confesses.
looks like i'll have to abort this prematurely again.
you mean, the creation magic his grandfather saw outside the hut of blessings? hmm, i wonder how exactly did the goddess of creation give them life?
these soldiers are fully armed. obviously, they didn't hastily join the battle.
so, you were saying aeur" "the little oceanid"?
but in hindsight, there were still flaws with our plan.
since you're back, i take it that the ronin are now gone from watatsumi island?
and now i wish for you to attend this meeting with me.
the situation is under control for now. the damage to our security system was minor. the intruder only managed to alter a small amount of data, so it was easy to fix.
why do i wield my sword? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
nevertheless, i do have a few matters i should like to entrust to you here today.
next time, i think i should be the one trailblazing with you guys -- welt can stay on the express.
don't freak him out. i work as the head of the divination commission most of the time.
someone's not in the best of moods let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
i knew you'd want to tag along. let's go.
how did you do on the exam then?
ahh! okay, it's about time i headed back. the naganohara fireworks show is just around the corner, and there's still a lot of things to get ready.
don't try and get me to cook. i can take care of anything else, but not that.
hey, you came. that was fast.
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns?
y'know, whenever the express stops at the station platform, i make a point of getting a few visits in.
you're right. if igor could see how impressive you are on the wardance stage, he would definitely be very proud.
and that's precisely why i haven't been able to shake off this strange feeling in the days since i started traveling with you.
don't believe me? let me tell you, cocolia and i shared a similar way of thinking back in the day.
well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
what do you think? be honest. i just want to know your first impression.
let's go, and watch your step. i haven't been here in a long time. there are probably some monsters around.
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet
my people have already prepared the evidence.
haha, of course! himeko and her collection -- more than enough reason to come visit the express.
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
we also gave quite a bit of thought to the price. we didn't want it to be too much more expensive than a traditional kite.
failure doesn't mean weakness. only the strong can gather the will to resist the order and try to break free.
try not to let him see you. we want this information to be as truthful as possible.
the cryo god's fatui have always coveted the anemo god's power.
and of course, since you're putting this on your body, you need to consider the type of fabric the clothes are made from. some materials might look stunning, but they can be terribly uncomfortable to wear
alright, alright. i'll go, but robin, i suggest you seriously consider this
didn't i make myself clear at the time? the decisions of the gods are naturally difficult for humans to comprehend. there is no need to provide an explanation
are there any other ways for adventurers to make mora besides their remuneration from the guild?
in any case, i don't suppose you came all the way here just to check on how the space station is doing?
that's right, you've been all the talk at the tavern. "that little girl from sumeru is really good at the game if i can find the chance, i would love to test my skills against her."
if we catch lady bailu, will luxie really follow her into our trap? do heliobi really have a sense of loyalty to their victims?
that makes sense. with such a long life, the grand craftsman can't remember every single item he's made. is there another way?
there may have been a few heliobi that slipped through the net, but they are of no major concern.
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
here's what i've drafted so far. anything else you want to add?
yo, remember, i'll need your help. let's go.
however, if it was poisoned in the battle over mondstadt all those years ago
as you can see, we're working on a construction project.
anyway, as long as you're all right. i should return to my room too.
you intend to stop her achieving victory? i can't say i didn't expect that response from you. but i hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
so if we were to build a trap together right now, what would you choose to build it with?
i have orders to evacuate civilians. see these two behind me? i need to get them out of here quickly. it's too dangerous.
responding to egeria's call, a number of warriors followed cassiodor into battle against the monsters. this group of warriors, under cassiodor's leadership, became known as the marechaussee hunters.
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
hearing you say that, a glimmer of hope flashes in his eyes. but, it disappears almost as quickly as it came.
no, not at all. we use it for surgeries in the alchemy commission, so what kind of side effects could it possibly have? it's just
good, and please remember, safety first.
lighting the incense will signify continuous growth and prosperity in all our endeavors in the new year!
need to take stock? just say the word -- we'll head over together.
never-changing eternity is the promise i made to my people.
they're getting ready to attack! those miners are unarmed.
hmph, delicious unauthorized delicacies sara will pay for this.
you are the enemy of eternity
vihar, thank you so much for doing all of this, and even dressed up as the knight of flowers, no less.
you said that when the hydro archon first created fontainians out of oceanids, she filled their blood vessels with primordial seawater
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
but the future is still clear -- the real test lies ahead the young swordmaster of the cloud knights. he will not be an easy foe.
it's okay, i'm not here to see him. we just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
oh, dodoco? what an interesting name. i really like it.
thank you for the concern, but i'm fine~ the general commanded me to stay with you -- i dare not go against military orders.
make no haste. since i am now a ninja hero fit to contend with the evil ninja would you let me join you in your crusade?
is that where i came from?
the culprit of this crime exploited that very fear to get access to this house without having to force their way in.
i've heard people everywhere tell tales of your heroics, and i've seen it first-hand adventuring with you.
alright, i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
...as miss topaz said, i'm here to talk about this aether spirit with you.
or i can just give you the mastery mark, up to you.
all the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. i stand before it alone and unchanging.
ultimately, he knocked cowell out, and the tool meant to cover the crime up also became a murder weapon.
the knights perform our duty precisely so that the city's residents may live in peace.
if we do not stop them now, they will pose a grave danger to the future generations of amphoreus.
to that point, as you know, the prototype of the jade chamber chess piece has been in the works for a long time, but i haven't once followed up on the progress.
sure, we have to attend classes sooner or later anyway. dreamweaving class is at the stage plaza. let's go take a look.
hee-hee, i knew it! this is what people like us live for. let's go!
i can't say for sure, but they're definitely planning something for the charmony festival.
i wonder what the old place is like now. maybe some things will still look familiar.
life is fleeting. we hope you'll have the opportunity to return to us on the luofu soon.
now, the residents of simulanka won't be scared of you anymore.
i've also arranged your accommodation. simply follow the instructions in the letter when you're back in the city.
when bronya becomes the supreme guardian, do you reckon she'll let me perform at golden theater? i'll re-arrange that "supreme guardian" stage show and make it a rock 'n' roll musical!
i am no exception my identity as a marechaussee hunter is not something i need people to remember. i wish only to be recognized as a champion duelist, nothing more.
you have earned a second chance with your honesty.
right answer. now's our chance to get through to her. you, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
you are mortals, and thus under their protection. there was no way they would have regarded you as someone with the ability to assassinate a god.
relax, she's the strongest girl i've ever seen.
let's cut to the chase. before the crisis struck, the astral express was guided here by a stellaron hunter, a wanted felon, in an attempt to resolve the stellaron crisis.
i've probably got a thirty% chance, or less.
now, we also know that every aspect of the vision hunt decree's promulgation and execution has been enthusiastically spearheaded by the tenryou commission from the outset.
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
as an observer, i get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
are you trying to scare people away?
please check all your belongings, everyone, and make sure you haven't forgotten anything. once you're ready, please follow me to the designated location.
it's kinda hard to explain
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
i'll make this quick. just one question: what did he buy while he was here?
we are just friends, i don't see what sheltering has to do with it. tell your subordinates to leave, we have things to discuss.
the paper looks familiar can i open it?
so dangerous you're lucky to have lived till now.
compared to you, mercs like me are just third-rate amateurs i've got no actual fighting skills to speak of. but that also makes it a whole lot easier for me to gain the locals' trust.
if you could see through the eyes of an adeptus, you wouldn't be so surprised.
come on, let's take the microfilm back to the museum.
afterwards, wildfire began to grow. to be honest, i never thought a day like this would come.
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
you can call me the memokeeper, black swan.
might i remind you that this is the fatui? have you completely forgotten what they did to us?
this design is a step down from the adepti's original guizhong ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
not a problem, i was thinking the same thing! but i'm afraid telling you might not be enough.
although, calling herself the "protector of order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law
but just now it all became clear to me. i still don't have the right to come to terms with fate on behalf of everyone else
me? there's not much to talk about
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
at the same time, the blessing of remembrance will fall upon everyone. please look forward to this surprise.
i take it this monster is whom i had the pleasure of meeting last time.
that's right -- you were just a victim of the heliobus's trickery, diviner fu -- no need to blame yourself.
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals at least, it was at the time of recording.
are you all right? watch out for sandstorms.
of course, if you have any genuine grievances about the auction, the lots, or the process, please enlighten me as to where exactly i went wrong.
where's the records room? answer me.
straight to the point. i like it.
you remember that norbert guy we captured? the silvermane guards have acquired new intel from him -- i thought you might find it interesting.
i'm hu tao, the current director of the wangsheng funeral parlor, responsible for well, trifling matters having to do with mortality.
if we were to use clockwork toys as an analogy, could it be that the tracks have eroded, or the gears have slid out of place?
yanqing, the wolf you are hunting is standing above us in the wardance ring at this very moment, facing the cloud knights
huh? this paint job and these custom parts. and the way the parts are attached it's all quite strange.
my brigade is called the "blazing beasts." we're not a large group, but every member is loyal and brave.
signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." for most of the residents here, especially those in the underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
every child in belobog should visit this exhibit at least once no, once isn't nearly enough.
it looks so much like dan heng i wonder if
gorou, if you want my opinion, you should be more concerned about ms. hina than you are about this.
how's it going, my little layla? have you been teaching your opponents a lesson?
once you come to friendly terms with the lawrence clan, you should be in a good position to learn more of their possible connections with the fatui.
i don't believe anybody could be more committed to bringing this story to life on the stage than they are now.
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea. anyway, i'm getting off-track, i won't take any more of your time. good luck.
that was a fine duel indeed. if you wouldn't mind, shall we play a few more matches?
i'm afraid i'm unable to share any wine recommendations with you. but i can recommend a few lesser-known restaurants that are well worth a visit.
there are even some extremists who go around shouting slogans like "retake sumeru for king deshret!" word is that more and more are joining their movement. they're becoming a real headache for chief and the others.
that sounds kinda weird
we're not taking a photo!
i know that he might be dangerous but he saved iwao, and the kids all warmed up to him right away. he even happily agreed to help us find the great mujina youkai.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
regardless of your choice, the chrysos heirs will continue to follow the path in the prophecy.
let's hurry back to fyxestroll garden now, while there's still a chance to turn things around. it's time to teach cirrus a lesson.
hehe, why don't you tell me a little more about how you got here first? then i'll
it's a good idea, but which one of us could hope to win against a researcher?
you might be able to remain stony-faced if you really try, but with your tail swishing behind you hehe, it tells everything.
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
no, you just have to be clear on what you should do.
i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
is it me or is it cold here?
okay, i'm done asking.
however, someone had already been on the scene before we arrived.
it's you again. who's talking to me?
i'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the memory zone.
the next time we encounter the dragon, how about we try talking to him instead of fighting?
the last time i came here on a starskiff was let me think about twenty years ago now. i've been on the road for so long that i've started to forget the sights and sounds of the xianzhou
but the whole thing also made me realize that there are still many problems in sumeru, and as a desert-dweller, i'm still not completely ready to settle down on this side of the wall.
sit back and enjoy the duel.
i huh. y'know, the more i think about it, the more it seems deliberate.
don't be nervous. everyone at zubayr theater has your back!
i only heard her voice. i wouldn't say i saw her
you will learn the truth about this world from me, and in return, i ask for you to promise me something.
yo, what's up! you're finally here! without you, our ghost-hunting squad would be nothing!
they have other things to take care of first. we couldn't afford to wait for them, but they'll join us later.
there will come a day when he leads everyone aeur" everyone we have left aeur" through the gates of the miracle.
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
where is he now? does he have plans to visit inazuma? if so, i will instruct one of the commissioners to bring him to me on his arrival. i would very much like to spar with him.
he says that his responsibility is "preservation." to do that, he must make decisions that best protect humanity.
clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
i know, i know, you've got an important task ahead sorry to keep you. priorities are priorities.
stable connection to the ley lines, no unexpected fluctuations both good signs.
speaking of stories, you've reminded me that now is not the time for them. moze, we've sent the "warning" from stargazer navalia. what's the situation on your end?
why don't we look around here first? i've been wanting to see the "zubayr theater," anyway.
ah to heck with it! how often do you get to come to the city? let's not get hung up over the prices!
he told me that he wasn't sure who my mother was, and in any case, she never came to see me.
forget it, it's not important. old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
whoa! nice! there were no witnesses, so this never happened, alright?
the shogun's army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this shuumatsuban ninja, i'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
ah, you've arrived. i've made all the necessary preparations and even packed some handmade snacks.
miss xinyan, please take this letter. enclosed is a travel permit that i processed personally for you.
that's right, but don't worry, this isn't a trial. i just want to have a chat with you and get a better understanding of the facts.
not so fast. even though we've cleared the theft allegations, we still haven't ascertained whether your arrival in inazuma was legal or not.
captain huohuo, should we start the ghost hunt now?
this all feels very suspicious. there must be more to this than he is letting on.
my apologies.
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
i shall ask you four questions. dishonest answers will cause the golden thread to vibrate, while truthful responses will not affect the thread.
hurry, chapter two, let's go. can't you see that satomi is waiting?
as much as i am interested to hear your story, i'm afraid i've already taken up too much of your time mister dan heng's worrying has created ripples in the water.
i went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
i already have a long list of vengeance to exact. even if i wanted to begin now, i'd have to start in the right order.
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring
"authorized personnel only. this chamber is sac" how do you pronounce it?
i'm sorry, i have something important to do right now. i'll be back later on.
those two who were snooping around were just a couple small fries. if we wanna get the real catch, we have to be patient and give it some time.
his method was a wish of sorts to begin with aeur" to join the past and future together and combine their beauty.
my home world is one of many planets changed by a stellaron *sigh* it's a shame i never got to witness how far it fell at the time.
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
i really can't recommend that store highly enough. a couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
the information held in the ley lines is complex and disorderly. the fact that we were able to meet him to begin with was a miracle of fate
aha, perhaps such plans have become second nature after all the diplomatic issues i've dealt with.
amber and i have some business to attend to now. see you later.
heh i think i know what this is about now. this is interesting.
it was largely an oversight on my part: i taught you to nurture a warrior's will, but never how to let it go.
i'm sure the grand master will have given due consideration to razor's circumstances. perhaps he felt that now would be the most appropriate time.
but you don't belong to this world. perhaps you are just the company she needs.
the atmosphere in this park is excellent. thank you
they sure made us run, though. if i ever have to run like that again on the job, i'm filing for worker's comp.
that's a good idea. it might be commonplace, but it's still the specialty of penacony. it would make for an ideal gift to bring home.
since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. i never thought i'd enter the underworld that has been sealed away for so long
it was a song with a harmonic tune.
what do you think, hook? are you willing to buy the geomarrow probe from me?
the longer one works as a judge, the more they understand one fact -- of all the people in this world, none is without blemish.
they will soon realize the situation. when old oti answered the last question, he represented more than just the alfalfa family.
i wouldn't worry. it's all work you'll be quite familiar with aeur" planning trips, gathering pertinent information, that sort of thing.
you know you're making a dangerous decision, right?
the result has invariably been that they "can't".
afterwards, why not sit down for a while in the jade chamber, or have a short stroll? rest is also an integral part of any journey.
the skit this time is a modernist one.
our mission started the moment we arrived here.
you know, the cruelty has never claimed victory. me, caiyi, your father guangyuan we were prepared for the worst when we enlisted.
i just can't help but feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
it was me who accepted the bet. you're not involved at all
the barrier hasn't been fixed yet. don't try and be a hero, gepard!
yet, i cannot jeopardize all of your lives in one single battle.
a newcomer with the cloud knights? *sigh* just go back to where she's from. everything is so competitive here in the luofu. you can't get promoted.
yes. to become fond of a place, to feel part of it it always requires a reason.
so, i will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
you sound exactly like master yanqing. but for now, both he and yunli have been forced to go to the alchemy commission for some well-needed rest.
that won't be necessary. i remember it all.
"take a photo"? once again, i'm faced with a combination of words that makes absolutely no sense to me.
since you invited me and all sure.
he's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
given our limited life spans, the only ones who place value on ceremony are us foxians.
perhaps some of you will have heard the news already. i am, in fact, planning to rebuild the jade chamber.
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur
that's what i'm saying! at first, sushang didn't believe that fyxestroll garden was haunted. but after the judges showed up
what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
the materials that mingxi and xiaohan provided were super useful.
descendant of the takatsukasa clan. explain what is going on here.
hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
the snow have you ever seen such beauty?
kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
wait, there shouldn't be a "two" in binary arithmetic!
for real? hmph, never mind the gift i got for you then
still, if we're going to hunt the monsters, we need to know where to find them. can you give us any leads?
is that mister giovanni?
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
so you heard my announcement, did you? what do you think? interested?
oh, don't pressure yourselves on my account! are you rehearsing for a show?
i've been to their estate many times, and i've never noticed anything suspicious.
here we are. this is the place.
if i may ask, what else has this alleged "card snatcher" suspected of doing?
if she asks you, just let her know my reasoning. she'll understand.
go and talk to these people. they're all customers of my pawnshop. see for yourself if their wishes have come true.
when i first set foot in the jade chamber, i stood at the edge of the platform and looked down upon liyue harbor far below.
vanquishing general? isn't that title a bit too narcissistic? i don't like it.
ugh in the eyes of most people, there's a world of difference between "trivial matters" and a career.
count me out. i've got plenty of work to do here for the homayani family.
only a hunter who is a true expert at subduing their prey can snare it without harming it. the line that divides life and death is often exceedingly thin.
she was pretty shy at first, but i explained that i just arrived in sumeru and had gotten lost, so i needed someone to help guide me
yes, and also never mind, i'll just show you. it won't eat up too much time.
make sure to take good care of it until the opening of the charmony festival. then, when the show reaches its climax -- press the button together with the others around you
i can assure you that she is exceptionally capable. all the doushin from the police station have vouched for her abilities.
now that the alliance has all of you there to help them, sending any elite fighters more would just be overkill.
while everyone is talking, you begin to carefully observe the captain's mannerisms.
well, given your experience and skill in that regard, i have no doubt you'll be able to overcome anything that comes your way.
wait, when did this happen exactly?
no, i'm nobody's attendant.
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
wait, three? there is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? wait it's
besides, even if he's caught, the guards would be too scared to do anything to him they've never seen lesser lord kusanali in person, after all.
lady fu xuan has such refined taste? the xianzhou really has changed a lot in the time i've been asleep.
you may as well come clean. you know i will not turn a blind eye to any violation of the rules in liyue harbor.
power duly assimilated. ready to receive instruction.
he's just surprised that it has resurfaced.
half an amber era ago, the family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that everyone on the planet became part of the family.
i didn't lie to you, right? i told you i'd bring you somewhere safe, and i did! though we did take a bit of a detour
okay. next, i will show you a secret kitsune spell. this painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means i'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
why are there seven people all striving to have a relationship with a single male protagonist? is this some sort of narrative device, too?
no, i never issued such an order.
our signatures are the grin-malkin cat and the bogglecat box. oh, and we'd need to add pers as well.
you're still the same -- carefree as always.
oh so that's your story
oh? what would you like to know, paimon?
however, if we find evidence to corroborate the claims of collusion between the fatui and the tenryou commission, i expect you to fully comply with our investigation. do we have an understanding?
let's get closer and find a place to hide so we can observe him.
more importantly i hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities
forget it, mirror. let's just leave.
i'm sorry. i can't let you regain your ability to feel just yet. you'd be in excruciating pain.
a slow-boiled soup of leftover chicken and pork bones drenched over some cabbage leaves. i have few culinary requirements. having a few staple dishes like this is enough.
don't worry, i'll do something about it. let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
that's the spirit, sounds like you're all fired up! if you could just keep your legs from shaking so much, it would be more convincing, march.
i'll give you a hint. it's to do with the yae publishing house.
my mother always told me that as long as i honed my skills, i'd be able to deal with any situation seems i've still got honing to do.
i have an agreement with the titan the chrysos heirs will take away their coreflame and use it to start a bright blaze that'll illuminate our path onward.
i do not know what to make of it either.
of course we included paimon. this is the story of everyone's big, happy adventure with dodoco.
i accidentally overheard how the express obtains fuel.
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
i know you've always perceived there was something special about the sacred sakura. but to me, it has always been there.
i've never heard of the golden apple archipelago. where is it?
candace is an expert at dealing with people like this. all we have to do is wait for her word.
he was left on a rock in the wilderness, his parentage completely unknown. it's a miracle he wasn't devoured by some wild beast.
"everywhere they go, they meet someone who's heard of him." hmm c'mon, let's keep asking around.
i heard that they found an antimatter legion bomb, and the entire luofu needs to be locked down for safety's sake. they'll only re-open after they've removed the bomb i don't know if that's true.
that's the second time you've evaded the possibility of a battle you really do want to change my prediction, don't you
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
i certainly would, in the past.
the reason you don't remember is that i wiped your memory before the operation at herta space station.
outsiders, seele, the second wave hasn't started yet. make the most of this opportunity and make a break for it!
thirty years ago, i fought in a terrible war. my comrade and i set sail together, but only i returned.
...xipe the harmony. legend has it that they participated in the crusade against the imperator insectorum and devoured ena the order for unknown reasons.
hmm, alright. it seems that your crew really can't go on without my care and direction.
we need a slogan to go with the picture. ugh i wish i'd read more books. any ideas?
that's right, no one else in aurum alley needs to worry -- it's all on me.
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
so, have you thought things through?
currently, there are three ways an aeon can perish known to humanity.
but i don't know when or where it'll happen, so i figured i can search while i travel.
i'd hesitate to call it that. shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom -- many people lost their lives trying to catch a tiny morsel of meat for dinner.
i don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for inazuma
i've poured all my best effort into this fireworks show. and now that we're here, i sincerely hope you will enjoy it.
i'm not trying to scare you -- i'm simply suggesting you ask the craftsmen to see if they can provide an insider like qingque to guide you.
i must continue forward just a few more steps and i'll be able to see droidhead!
thank you for your help, general. let's get going!
cocolia it's been so many years since we last spoke. we were great friends once -- there was nothing we wouldn't share.
if he paid more attention to his affairs, it'd save me a lot of headaches i guess i do create a few headaches for him too maybe we're even.
descendant of the kujou clan. your turn.
it's for your own good, little yunli. while you desire to compete against each other, i don't want to see either of you getting hurt.
all the literature, furniture, and ornaments i had collected followed the original jade chamber to its watery grave
the principle behind this machine and the one you fixed when you first came to the workshop is the same. you'll understand when you see it.
i heard the healer lady is capable of curing all diseases. i'm here for the same reason anyone would be -- for a check-up and consultation.
my wardrobe? it's probably close to twice the size of the space station. ah, the world lost an emanator of beauty the moment nous cut in line and gazed upon me first!
i'd like to earnestly thank you, traveler. if it weren't for your companionship, i would still be embroiled in my inner conflict right now.
oh, nothing. i just zoned out for a moment.
a friend of yours? oh, so she must be the one you were telling me about
wait a sec you sure that's the latest style? that sounds a lot like what the older folks back home would wear
in which case my lady, could you ask the master to come out and have a chat with us?
do i sound that negative? no. we believe that existence has meaning, but that meaning is bestowed by ourselves, not by choices.
master, are these creations truly able to protect the artisanship commission? there's already been so much destruction -- why haven't we seen any in action?
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations
he allows you to apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the wound, and it appears to bring him much relief. the tension in his brow eases.
humans traverse the path of fate... seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist...
i can't make another one, but i'm guessing sakujirou probably won't be needing his anymore it'd be a shame for it to go to waste, so i'll make an exception and let you set it off instead.
enough talk, you're coming with me. chief oleg wants to see you, and he's got more than a few questions.
oh, you beat me to it. looks like your brain is intact.
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
here is the pass permit. show it to the okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
yes. maybe we're already used to bad luck, and we know how to deal with feelings of sorrow and disappointment.
well, there's nothing else for it, we're duty-bound to help the ten-lords commission
did your memory module get damaged? maybe i can fix that too.
it feels like we're just dancing to the heliobus's tune
grandpa almond, could you take the concoction to the room underneath the tavern and place it next to the transparent bottle you found? i'll handle the rest.
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
ororon? well he was left at the side of the road as an infant and the people of the tribe took him in. you could say that everyone had a hand in raising him.
she mentioned that this transaction involves the watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
yes, but ororon's a special case.
this qian ketong person should be sparkle's targeted victim this time around.
by the way, aren't they supposed to be taking the sword to the artisanship commission for repairs? why haven't they come out yet any ideas?
pleasure to meet you, miss topaz. i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
how about forgoing the mask design then? a mask with no facial features, a personality with no personality
i saw you the day before the goethe hotel. gepard took you to see mo-- the supreme guardian. he told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
it appears so. we can't go on like this.
time for your second test. i'll be your examiner this time, and i'll be testing your ability to defeat enemies with unconventional moves.
i've also heard some things about this card snatcher you're pursuing.
so we had to map out the gates all over again to make sure we're deploying the array properly.
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
we must rescue the messengers, get out of here, and spread the news. we mustn't give up as long as there's a glimmer of hope!
maybe they're also waiting for the express to arrive. you guys really carry a lot of weight on your shoulders, don't you?
the shogun does not make mistakes aeur" she is incapable of doing so. but i, as ei, would like to offer my apologies.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
traveler, you're an adventurer do you understand what i mean?
now, it seems like she was right, while i took the wayward path.
"foreign object"? that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
everyone, i suggest that we stop here for a moment. we should take stock of our surroundings before deciding on our next course of action.
because she is a god. it's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
it might also have been because clara was here -- the little girl in red. she's best pals with svarog -- always following behind him.
quite a strong reaction this time. does this mean what he was really seeking was the mare jivari's location?
apyra? that heliobus's name is apyra?
"the incantation, 'abracadabra,' means 'to create what i say.' this is a world made of words, where fantastical powers can be wielded by all."
we hope the residents of mondstadt and visitors from all over will enjoy the magnificent wines and experience the joy of the harvest.
for beings transformed by the abundance, there's a difference. do you know how abominations of abundance and xianzhou people differ?
there's no style in resorting to violence. it's simply the worst of all the bad decisions you could make.
as for what my wish is hehe, it's a secret for now.
would you be willing to join me? c'mon, take a break from adventuring to listen to a story.
this must be the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish the causal relationships between objects.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down
i heard it, too. let's investigate.
robin believed it was because the harmony had been tampered with somehow, but as far as i know, there aren't many entities capable of interfering with the power of paths.
since the war is now over, i propose that we have the yashiro commission appoint a business council to oversee trade between our two islands.
what do you mean by that? you expected me to just keep running and hiding from my responsibility forever?
stop hanging around here and find something better to do. once i'm done in a few days, call up lil gui and huohuo, and let's grab a meal at aurum alley. it's been ages since we hung out.
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
in pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe, huh? in that sense, you astral expressers and i are cut from the same cloth.
looks like i'm quite famous on the xianzhou luofu, too.
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
you allow yourself to be led away by guards surrounding you on both sides.
as long as you let your consciousness freely drift, it doesn't matter where you are.
believe in your ears. it is indeed as you heard.
zhiyi? well, obviously, as the most promising candidate, we will be investigating him ourselves.
when i was little, i thought it was because he really understood me, and agreed with whatever i had to say. so, i'd tell my pops everything.
it's okay! phew, this one's strong alright!
what an interesting way to mark the start of your journey. i grow more and more curious about your cause.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
and now that the gods have given me their blessing it actually feels more like i'm finally able to take my fate in my own hands.
as guuji of the grand narukami shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. only then am i capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
oh, i see. that'll be the fishing boats coming back from the open ocean. how much cargo were they carrying? remember, i taught you how you can tell.
but i am serious! and i'll remember every transgression committed against me! ugh, it's no wonder so many people dislike you!
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
all basic skills required by competent adventurers, if i'm not mistaken.
however, if you agree to give up that half-baked plan to go public, the ipc will assure you that we'll never jeopardize the interests of the family heads under your leadership.
of course, if that's all there was to it, i wouldn't look into it any further.
hear that? ding a ling ding a ling my silver hairpiece is ringing like a bell! the wind is nice and gentle today.
and my phone definitely doesn't have enough storage so, memorizing it is the most convenient way to go.
huh? i can't see the memory storage for this terminal
as a fleeting emotion, she's no different from a newborn. her boarding this ship was solely down to her inner impulse.
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
but, how we can get him to do that showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
um, i'll go get the box and slips of paper for the lots. please wait a moment
a world fettered by three paths, its destiny hanging in the balance
naturally, they would also regard ningguang's locking down the area, questioning the citizenry, and pursuit of the assassin to be pointless work. perhaps they even wonder if there might be a cover-up.
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
i went back to the domain again just now. although i couldn't find a new route, it wasn't a completely fruitless trip.
are you still thinking about the past, lord phainon?
it seems that's everything we now know one of the culprit's physical traits and that he is extremely violent. but how can we track him down?
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
even if the ending of the story may be childish and ridiculous, it won't really matter
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
i did say this is what "we're" going to do. i trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
oh, so you're here to take part? well if we bump into each other out there you'd better be ready. this time we're gonna show you what we're really made of!
the shogun's army might as well just be me!
gardes, take vacher away!
it is said that the space station also contains madam herta's private chamber where her most precious, rare, and dangerous collections are sealed... and for someone like her, it's not out of the realm of possibility.
even after your rebirth, your moves and techniques haven't changed one bit.
come, young man -- i'll let you finish up.
i think the key will be to make something that easily catches the attention of people who haven't played much chess before.
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
but they're the ones getting besieged.
you don't have to join me if you don't want to. i can go sort out the firework materials and the boat by myself, and then you can come and meet me back at the house later.
the prophecy sent an ambassador. they acknowledged lord phainon's strength and character, but had doubts about his strength of will.
it is something of a luxury, but i love listening to the rain from the courtyard.
oh, i beg to differ! the first meal i ate in liyue harbor was at wanmin restaurant. xiangling's cooking gave my tastebuds plenty to be excited about!
darn, the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish causal relationships.
that's all you needed to say! let's go.
i'd be perfectly happy with that aeur" i'm just worried that captain beidou's business might be negatively affected.
guinaifen, an outworlder, unemployed you entered fyxestroll garden with sushang, a cloud knight, the day before yesterday.
i must commend you for your insight in having discerned this principle.
hmm sounds like you know a lot about him?
nilou of zubayr theater. i know her really well. we can trust her.
you mean how it looks? like a train. well
in the meantime, do you think you could head out and look for more clues? we can compare notes when you're done - i'm counting on you!
don't take any of what i just said seriously! how could i possibly let fontaine fall to the whims of trivial prophecy?
those people are carrying bowls bowls full of beans. what's that all about?
if we'd had more time, we could have built a barrier here to absorb the impact of the waves.
so your invisible opponent was the legendary bosacius, marshal vritras?
got it, the encryption key! quick, before we attract attention, let's--
good. and as agreed, please use top-grade materials only.
i don't want to make things difficult for official dahao. let's do this his way and prove my innocence.
that's quick thinking, and very sound logic. aventurine is no fool. and working with him definitely has its dangers.
the almighty shogun i have seen her on but only a few occasions, most of them formal ceremonies
oh, by the way, you're overthinking the whole natlan issue, paimon. natlan has human inhabitants and its own unique culture, just like fontaine.
have you guys heard of the luofu?
approximately how many people are exhibiting these symptoms?
really? then the next time we meet, i'll bring some fireworks for us to launch together! it'll be fun!
in the end, we decided to combine liyue's traditional art of kite-making with fontaine's "mechanical vertical lifting device."
no clue, but i know one thing
but we still don't have any weapons in hand
mister svarog they want to talk to you about going to the surface.
hmm? are these footprints?
"everwinter hill" what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat?
he has so many great swords that he never uses. sometimes, i can hear those swords crying is this what people mean when they say "spoiled for choice?"
(i--it kinda works, right?)
ignore him. strength is everything!
not at all. i was actually just about to go find you.
did you think this swordplay was just a game of victory and defeat, future sword champion?
nothing's wrong, okay? come on. we're going to war.
in this world, there are paths beyond waiting for us to explore.
as for the akademiya let's go once i get myself a set of sumeru-style clothes.
yes, but only for a week. by the end of that week, i defeated it in combat, and we've shared a cordial relationship ever since.
good. i've made some progress in my investigation as well.
okay, fine, but only tonight. tomorrow's a big day, and many no-good scumbags are gonna take advantage of that.
it might mean the tables have turned.
and i thought i have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, mister zhongli.
and you too! what about you, mavuika?
i'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. unfortunately though it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
deal. well, you guys take your time. everything's all set for the assessments to go ahead.
the charmony festival? heh, you think you can scare me? you think i've no idea what you're planning?
even with two demigods protecting the holy city, the risk is too great. hence
don't worry. as long as they're willing to cooperate, this'll be a straightforward deal.
if you treat your lives as mere trifles, then you may do as you wish.
she's been down in the dumps ever since she lost tail.
the artisanship commission delve should have suspended operations after the stellaron corrosion began. why haven't these people taken starskiffs to safety?
i'm sorry you're right. i'll consider what we've found, and not jump to conclusions just yet.
um cloud retainer spends most of her days studying mechanisms in her abode. she's on her own so much of the time that the moment she has someone to chat with, she just
people still use mora in commercial transactions, i assume?
it's just a few steps away -- you're not leaving with us?
(oh? they appear to be feeling quite confident. looks like our work will go smoothly.)
was the seer strategist thinking of us, or thinking of the fates we're destined for?
i'm sushang of the cloud knights. i think you already know the little girl with horns on her head. and this is
nononono, i wasn't doubting her ability i just feel like we shouldn't bother her with such a trivial problem.
anyway, it's getting late. i should escort miss dunyarzad to nilou's stage. see ya later.
"it is a beautiful thing born from our life experiences. whenever there is joy or something to be celebrated, people will dance."
c'mon, who knows if you'll get a chance like this again!
when people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. sampo's first and second laws of motion.
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
the heater you saw is just a standard geomarrow radiator. they may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
a nearby merchant folds his arms and gives you a disdainful look. you get the impression that he's someone who has long gotten used to the sight before him.
i understand. the luofu is in danger, and members of the six commissions should stand united.
he's actually explaining his joke!
naturally, take your time.
ah! paeur"please, no, don't do that to me
so, have you made your choice?
huh? you're leaving so soon?
i see. you decided to admit to your feelings in an effort to bring me down with you
i say "gift," but it's more like bits and pieces the kids cobbled together. still, i hope you like it.
but i preferred the character design of the deputy sheriff. can it come back?
listen, i'm just updating you on the situation, not asking for your opinion. i don't really care whether you continue your investigation.
my situation is completely different. i'm here because i was asked to accompany you. the tea purchase is simply an added bonus of this location.
attachment, desire, longing... they may all be right, but they are all incomplete.
what an honor! where are my manners -- we can talk about heaters all day if you like. let's have a chat~
for me, living one's days out like that is too repetitive
hm would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
are you really from the divination commission?
since assuming the role of helm master, it's rare that i have the chance to gaze upon the stars like this
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something
no! it's a tear! those bad guys did it!
well, that solves our problem. you have our thanks.
ruan mei is a genius among geniuses -- i won't deny that. i don't always get along with her, but i do admire her maybe the admiration is mutual.
have you ever heard of cursed swords? that sword is one.
see! that was easy.
and as for hoolay, i'll send my lieutenants jiaoqiu and moze to check on his condition in prison and ready him for transport. if there are no more questions, shall we get this started?
still, i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
revenge is also a form of the hunt. however, that doesn't explain how she managed to bring the stellaron into the scalegorge waterscape, which was guarded by the vidyadhara.
(i need to rethink things. this is a crucial moment, so i can't mess up.)
come with us for now. i'll take care of things here later.
looks like the key to winning lies not in the puzzle itself, but in the motives behind miss sparkle's strange behavior i'm afraid this chase may just go on forever.
hook, julian, and the moles all have different dreams. i don't think anyone should take them away
it's alright, my lady. that's pretty common in mercenary circles. didn't i mention that my father was chasing after women? i was the result of one of those encounters with some random person.
what kind of place could this be? defeating khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure.
then let's continue our conversation. please, topaz, invite "sweet dew" to join us at the table.
the other method i'm trying is using the wooden tiles as coupons. just by writing things like "buy one get one free for the holder of this tile" on them.
i've heard that a skilled masked fool received an invitation too that must be you, right? did you enjoy yourself?
ah, such an intense emotion heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
general jing yuan?
if i remember correctly, you, march, and dan heng came here on that train -- the "astral express" -- right?
right! let's call it a day. and you too, judge hanya -- don't work yourself to death.
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
my, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.
with those annoying bugs squashed, we're done fixing the computing zone too.
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products
come at us, mister luka! my team will show you the prowess of the cloud knights' formation!
so where are we headed to now, bronya?
good afternoon. it is normal to feel drowsy after lunch, might i interest you in a game of go to stimulate the mind?
now, please excuse me, i have other business that demands my attention. i wish you a fun-filled festival.
the inauguration ceremony went very smoothly. i didn't expect so many underworlders to come and listen to the address.
that is of no concern. this is my recuperation state.
i didn't expect someone who can't even hold onto his sword to actually have some skill.
i know that you poured great efforts into these plans, uncle. but you were well aware that it was not the right thing to do. as a knight of favonius, i could not overlook your actions.
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express, just to listen to music?
"mecha" what an intriguing statement. i recall the bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal -- "a tall male in silver armor."
mister zubayr, our manager, always says that celebrations aren't just for fun, but that they should also be occasions for reflection and review
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
as for the two foreign warriors select one to accompany you, phainon. placing both esteemed guests on the front line would not be proper.
let's go! stay close, you two. cloud knight sushang will guarantee your safety!
count me in. i'm sure miss qingque has something up her sleeve.
divination commission? celestial jade? shouldn't they be doing divinations?
i suppose what it comes down to is the definition of "eternity" she set out with.
a long, long time ago, on one of greater lord rukkhadevata's birthdays, her friends threw her a celebratory banquet.
i actually have something i need to do as well, so i should get to the wangsheng funeral parlor.
why are you so focused on all the wrong things?
mhm, make sure you never forget about it.
mm don't give me that look. it's just a game after all, and having fun should be your main concern.
lingsha told me there's tasty food in aurum alley, let's go there.
i couldn't care less about what happened with the space station, but i will surely repay the favor tenfold to anyone who dares to taunt me.
as adventurers, you two will doubtlessly travel to many more lands and see many more things.
uh shenhe, and the conqueror of demons
in the past, we sat in our high chairs in the court, giving our opinions on isolated cases, all while knowing very little about the human stories behind each and every one.
if this is what they want, i'm always up for a challenge!
if you say so, but you can sneak out for the next sabzeruz festival, right? we'll make sure the next one is a smashing success!
if i had to choose my color, it would be the color of this handkerchief.
performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
today i just realized i misheard her. i think she actually said: "the edge may break, but the heart remains" probably.
let's talk about something less serious for now. would you mind giving the three of us some space, tribbie?
judging from what's left on the scene, there must have been a fight. but after that, the factions seem to have gone their separate ways. both the phlogiston and the elemental traces in the air support that.
yes, for a puzzle that was designed from the start, choosing any other path would be a pointless mistake.
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
then my duty as her eternal familiar is to drag her back out of her own head and into the real world.
i saw tingyun in so many shops and just thought she was a customer who's always buying stuff then i heard all those shops are hers!
here are the coordinates. it's up to you how to proceed.
it will be a lot of work, and i'm most grateful to you.
in which case i shall call upon outrider amber to track it down
eventually, she became the head of the entire commission, which required her to learn patience and adopt a meticulous approach to her work.
but eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, ei.
ahem kaedehara, about the vision hunt decree
you have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
it's true -- the divination commission really can't go a single day without lady fu.
luckily, there were only two of us, and both of us were nimble enough to dodge most of the strikes. there were a lot of fatui, though, and they were being torn to shreds by the bolts of lightning.
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
thank you. we'll be a lot stronger together with you.
with the allowance grandpa gave me, we'll be able to have a huge meal! no, three huge meals!
i'm just speaking my mind. trust me, you're really talented.
whaaeur"? there might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
there are ipc advertisements everywhere. it's about time i got in touch with their trade commissioner.
one more thing, don't forget to seal the heliobi within the evil binding matrix.
although you attempted to make a promise, your resolve didn't match your response a step will be recorded.
kujou kamaji a descendant of the kujou clan, i presume.
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
uhh there's still one more round to go. would he really go to a tavern in the middle of the competition?
strange, why is there no one here?
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory
i hope i won't meet member #four polka kakamond. that would be quite troublesome.
naeur"no, it's not like that!
goodness, i presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
the engine of creation sadly, i never got the chance to see the robot myself.
there's no need to rush to the ring just yet, let's get to know your opponents around here first.
thaeur"then, may i ask some questions? in my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things
as a mark of my gratitude, i will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
first of all, zhiyi isn't much of a drinker. on some level, he hates alcohol because of what it did to his father.
i really like being with you. i don't know why, but it feels like a butterfly is trying to burst out of my chest anyway, how about i show a new dance to you?
he goes by "blade" nowadays? a fitting name for someone who dedicated his mind and body to the ways of the sword.
oh, i'm afraid i'm not built for hard labor
so if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. relax, if i need your assistance, i won't hesitate to ask.
do you really think of yourself as someone so exceptionally amazing? right now, you're more like like like someone from the nitwit society.
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
hmph, you saw right through me. why else would i be standing here today?
please, call me lan yan. and i'm no "master craftswoman," just a humble maker of handicrafts.
we may live underground, but we won't be buried by this city.
haha, love it, but i bet there's a lot of songs with that name. it sounds like something randy would play -- he's one of my favorite legendary guitarists. may he rest in peace
i saw her exit the venue after the semifinals, but she hasn't returned since.
all i know is that whenever i start chatting with people, my hands would get more and more full until i can't hold everything anymore. this seems to happen every time
i'm just an alchemist -- i don't understand them in any detail. i only know that they are a group of xianzhou people who view themselves as denizens of abundance.
not quite yet. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
so the three of them teamed up to kill her?
this may sound embarrassing, because i would sometimes forget stuff i really shouldn't have from past experiences... it's just a habit of mine, don't mind me.
next, find a suitable spot and try *walking up* the wall.
leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken penacony from this dream.
listen to me, gepard! the origin and spread of the fragmentum is linked to the stellaron. the meteorite in the architects' records, it's--
just tell him the palais mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. he shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
sure but i may not be able to offer any practical advice if our topic of discussion is not work-related.
i trust that one day, her present experiences will become unique memories.
unwinding in a bath sounds appealing now would you care to join me?
yes, more people will be traveling between watatsumi and narukami island from this day forward.
the looks on your faces tell me you found some good stories.
there's no reason to be upset by this. time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. so, you must be happy in the present. you should understand what i mean now.
but you can't bring yourself to do that, can you? you care too much about director aurelie and the home she built you all to let go.
my powers of suggestion are capable of convincing people to accept my orders all without a second thought.
hmph, showing your true colors now that your evil schemes have been exposed? they're calling for their fellow ape fiendlings. please take cover behind me!
uh, um ugh, you saw right through me
what's gotten into you? come on, sit yourselves down.
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
why does luka always come sneaking back into town like this?
i imagine this must have taken baishi completely by surprise.
okay, here we go eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
lady bailu disappeared? that's nothing new -- she sneaks off all the time.
that's not the only thing you won't have heard of down here, princess.
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
i just discovered a new path over there that seems to lead to an unknown area.
film! did you hear that? that film he mentioned must be the same one that was stolen from the museum.
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel
life is ephemeral, and i only wish to be a piercing arrowhead -- to be the hunt -- until my very last breath.
unfortunately, given that said antagonist is under the protection of two commissions and the raiden shogun, we would be rather hard-pressed to track them down.
why are you being so polite? oh, and why's the city under curfew all of a sudden? has something happened?
madam cocolia i am grateful to you for raising me, and for allowing me the privilege of choice.
interesting this is certainly an improvement.
you two have held out long enough -- help is at hand!
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder
no, no, she's got skill alright, i can tell she's got training.
even today, in my hometown people still say things like, "you'll never cross mt. tao du when you die." it's very insulting though, so don't go around repeating it
from the moment i walked in, i made it clear that the questions i'd ask might not reflect my actual thoughts.
the heavenly principles irrelevant nonsense as far as i am concerned.
i'm just curious -- now things have come to this, is the family still unwilling to fight? i mean, your darling sister's already a goner, right?
she suddenly disappeared the night i turned ten years old.
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
don't be ridiculous, luka. still, whatever your motivation was, i hope you can find a different outlet for it.
what!? cloud retainer? yaeur"you were still listening?
i'm good at documenting information and coming up with my analysis. acting on that analysis is the captain's job.
brought him back? can someone please explain?
since the goal here is to bond with our fungi, we should treat them as friends and create happy memories with them. eating and having fun together are vital components of "friendship training."
as for the context we'll need to sort that out a bit. hurry along now. recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
you see? you can perceive some spiritual abnormalities now. congratulations.
but why so coy today, huh? you only gave us his age and description, why can't you reveal his name? is he sumeru's most wanted, or something?
i'll, uh i'll go keep watch!
i mean we're somewhere called the forest of blessings, so it kind of makes sense.
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation
i did kind of force it on you, after all. not to mention that i dragged you along with me and gave you all sorts of trouble along the way. hehe, i'd feel bad if i charged you any mora.
i'll help you. no matter where it is, you must be reunited!
haha, the enthusiasm is cute, but don't think just because you're still figuring out the game that pela and i will take it easy on you!
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already
i can't even tell if it's ingenium or biological in nature.
i'm honored to have her think of me this way. if i have a chance in the future, i would really like to invite her to one of my performances.
i didn't realize that one as skilled as diviner fu would also be susceptible to the power of the heliobi.
what else can i do? identify what's malfunctioning within the audience system and fix it, of course.
eric said that we need to take the shopping street to go any further. i think i still remember where it is this way.
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
i remember the kremnoans commissioned you to craft a divine object before. do you happen to recall the details?
*sigh* looks like we're gonna to have to resort to unconventional methods. are you gonna come with us willingly, or do i have to ask the guy behind me to carry you in his white death-box?
as a mortal, i've never dared to imagine a liyue without rex lapis.
such determination it makes me wonder what secrets are hidden within you. a step will not be recorded.
the four beacons have been lit, but we still don't know what trials may lie ahead.
i'm sorry to interrupt your lovely little chat here, but i think there's something you may need to know.
you may be a ray of hope that fell onto amphoreus. however, until all has been proven, you cannot be allowed to pose a threat to amphoreus.
the strength gained through my own hard work is truly fulfilling. hehe, thanks for your support.
i like your analogy very much. indeed, birds are born to fly, but in a distant past, their ancestors could only gaze at the sky in envy.
ah yes, rings a bell. so what? i had no reason not to teach them.
uh, let's cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we
*sigh* you're both impossible. go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person
but you also look like you're up to no good haha, seems pretty interesting.
it's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. you can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful ei
the encounter at the dreamscape hotel was a sign.
my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
um, maybe we can talk about that later
this is where the mechanical waste is disposed of though. could it be
let's shake hands! again! again! still remember? it's an expression of happiness and gratitude aeur" a way to express joy at all the good things in life!
i'm sorry, my lady, but no can do. there are still a few things i need to take care of back at the brigade. besides, the desert hasn't exactly been the most peaceful place lately.
if it were me i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
mister wheel! you didn't get hurt when we fell, did you?
a duel? i had the same intention in mind. let us begin at once.
seeing as you're right here in front of me like this, then i guess the answer is "a trashcan," right?
i'm at your service. i will not disappoint.
this time around, there were no successful bids for him.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
i doubt the underground will ever see it fully excavated
c'est la vie indeed! alas, i am forced to watch on helplessly as a more brave and seasoned adventurer than i swoops in to save the day.
and your masters, the kujou clan of the tenryou commission aeur" they are the ones keeping the truth from reaching the shogun.
enough chit-chat -- look! this is the weird stuff that happened yesterday when i was streaming in fyxestroll garden!
we didn't speak all that much you know how it is, i can only talk to dad for so long before i start losing it.
he did not realize that this sound could be heard by everyone in the opera house, which is why he claimed earlier that he could not hear the sound.
what a beautiful view. the ocean is good company i hope we can all find some peace and happiness while we're here.
they were tough times. but i had a clear goal and plenty of motivation.
hmm. well, i think it was a combination of the weight and the energy it contains.
i'll come with you. it can't hurt to have a magical fairy tag along, right?
work has been busy and i shouldn't leave, but i wouldn't be able to stop worrying about klee.
you call that normal? i might have let it slide if it was in the cage on second thought, no, that was cringe even by fight club standards.
it seems our every meeting is accompanied by an incident of some sort. i hope i can meet the astral express crew under better circumstances next time.
here, these are your wages, as promised. not a single mora short.
okhema is approaching its end. i do not wish to give my people false hope not when we've been badly scarred by it before.
why is that surprising? playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and i was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
i see. well, thank you for sharing that with us.
that's right, in the name of the family that you so dearly revere, uncle schubert.
and i've actually already restored part of the information. but lynx said that you have to be the first one to look at it, because the owner of this jade abacus is your idol.
this is a tuskpir of the xianzhou zhuming: warm, sweet, not for consumption.
got any more tricks up your sleeve? let's see them all.
hey, silent but deadly, shout if you see any danger, okay? don't think just because you know a move or two you can charge off by yourself!
now that i think about it perhaps i was too naive. she'd probably forgotten it even existed.
the grand sage is in his custody. even i know how terrible it is to fall into cyno's hands, so he probably does, too.
the ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. this is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
i will never forget you, and all that you did for inazuma.
why don't we flip the question and start by asking who couldn't be the murderer? after all, there are only three suspects, so elimination could be a valid method.
a kindhearted cat-eared gentleman on the way over
nice, you guys are bringing the heat! can you go one better?
such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of eternity. i'm afraid i'll have to consider it further.
his being yet again demonstrates that there are those who, despite being offered countless choices, will always choose the same path.
ah. you're saying that he wasn't
i gave him an assignment. he's taking part in a surprise attack against the shogun's navy.
they not only helped avin find her best friend, but they also showed us what an urstone is.
um we don't really know a whole lot about wineware let's just go with zhiyi's choice. would you be able to show us the one he bought?
in the animation, he's hanu's partner and one of the founders of dreamville. does that mean the watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with asdana?
i heard that some stalls at the wisdom gala are debuting new games, so feel free to drop by if you're interested. otherwise, see you next round!
the devorator would be a formidable adversary for any mortal being, even ones as capable as the hunters.
this must be the result of pascal's meticulous repairs but the little fella doesn't really need the monitor, does he?
yeah, they do, and it's a reaaaaaally big one! you're the conductor of your group, aren't you? you remind me of mister zubayr!
i'm sorry we have an understanding. i stand with them.
are you alright? are you hurt anywhere? do you feel dizzy? tired? or
this doesn't feel very "me." is this okay?
hm if i hadn't moved away when i did, i'd probably be where they are right now.
(he's sure saying some weird stuff.)
greetings everyone, i hope i'm not intruding.
nah, are you kidding? you're worrying too much.
no matter, it'll just require a bit more work to get through.
staring at me won't get you anywhere. or, did you want some more tea?
hah. well, i'm afraid i'm having far too much fun to stop what i'm doing and start bickering with you, captain.
xiaohan, whenever you are ready. tell us about your plan for aurum alley.
but even though we're all well-acquainted by now, i think this festive gathering deserves something ceremonious.
we don't have much time. if i were you, i'd make a move before it's too late.
hold on now. would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
but i chose to obey the shogun. for as long as she leads the way, who among us is qualified to judge between right and wrong when we have not yet reached the end of the path?
that's what you wanted to ask when we were at uncle anpu's house, right? jabari's one of the villagers you talked to. you know aeur" the one who wanted to treat isak and his grandpa to some food.
really? you better not be making things up!
looks like we'll have to play this little game of sparkle's then.
so you're the general's cook?
thanks for the help, mister farhad, but let me make one thing clear first: don't try to ask about what's in the new show.
so i've been running a fool's errand this whole time.
there's a pleasant breeze and glorious sunshine so, where shall we go for a walk?
i can't believe you actually got so many eremites into sumeru city!
trying to hasten your demise by being glib with your response? i can certainly satisfy your desire. a step will be recorded.
yes, i did. but you must know, in the lawrence family, "dear friend" is a set phrase that can only be used towards certain friends with whom one is acquainted, but not particularly close.
i'll give that poor flying sword some proper maintenance. i won't consider returning the sword unless he learns how to say "please," "hello," "thank you," and "sorry."
hold on, sir we have documents authorized by the family that would aid your investigation. if it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this mister gallagher?
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
waeur"well maybe it was! i like golden shrimp balls, is that a problem!
i should inform you that we took out a fatui camp recently. i suspect that before long, they will attempt to reestablish contact with your people in the hope of procuring some assistance.
after all that i've done to reach you, droidhead you'd better not snub me.
he must be a fan of this book too i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
how should i put this there's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
sorry, but even a general needs to pay their bills. we don't do credit here. and let's not forget, you'd have been waiting decades for a chance to see the dragon lady if it weren't for me.
wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. like i said, you can think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground.
no one gets left out of my stories!
heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. there are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us why don't we just leave it at that for now?
come onnnn~ together is better!
alright, i agree. as long as it helps you with your research, you can do whatever you want.
your soul is remarkable. such a strong presence even on par with the lord of the night.
right there, the tallest building in the city. it's also the headquarters of the sky-faring commission. let's hurry. we haven't got much time.
ah, you've finally arrived. there's no time to spare, so we'll begin with our first lesson
of course -- i wouldn't ask you to start a whole investigation from scratch.
don't worry, i have made preparations. the wound dressings are ready and the millelith have set up an ambush.
the original mikawa flower festival was much more lively. but even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
all right. drift peacefully off to sleep, and i'll be right with you.
huh? so, you're the appointed ones this time?
mine cart pin mine cart wheelset confirm just like that?
oh, by the way, everyone's really thankful to you for helping out with the debate.
well, i'm sure the summons were a part of it, too.
i hope serval's right that supreme lunatic better not have harmed bronya.
now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits"? anyone?
the harmony needs a new direction. only by bidding farewell to the past can we actually sail into the future.
hiding something extraordinary with something extraordinary this is pretty herta. i assume you know what to do? i mean, you've read that catalog for quite a while.
but only if you feel this is something that would help, of course.
really? i hope you're not just saying that to reassure me. i want you to be straight with me if you have any suggestions.
and i finally got wind of your movements when you were on the way to wangshu inn.
which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
takatsukasa another familiar name. they have been faithfully serving the kujou clan all these years?
however, your zealousness inhibits your ability to hide your line of attack.
in other words, it's like a bond!
why is that? is your constitution somehow different from the average person?
okay, i won't beat around the bush. oh, and i'm sorry for interrupting your rest. i'll treat you to some charcoal grilled steak to make up for it.
an eyewitness claimed to have seen ororon speaking to some fatui soldiers here.
hey, look. what's that hole in the ground?
though i suppose it wouldn't be no man's land anymore what a conundrum.
in contrast, zhiyi is evenly balanced across the board, and enjoys an excellent reputation in liyue.
i expect they still hold a grudge against me to this day.
eventually, you get used to the unpleasant odor of straw, mold, and rust, and find yourselves alternating between fits of drowsiness and despair
you could take the view that whatever i say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the ley lines.
in fact, by way of thanks, i'd like to invite you to the palace of astrum for tea. it is about time we knew each other better.
with the mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
so you mean that it symbolizes dreams?
the alliance has been trying to root out their secret organization for millennia -- it's no coincidence that they've chosen this moment to reveal themselves.
with the major changes in liyue recently, the ministry of civil affairs and the millelith already have their hands full. they don't have any time to investigate rumors about treasure hoarder activity.
in other words, we've successfully completed this stage of the plan! the doctor is out of the picture now.
if you were just wandering around, or if you agreed to be sealed away in an experiment pod, that would be fine.
we have already rooted out those behind the resistance. all who have dishonored the almighty shogun will be punished.
currently, the shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. so the easiest solution was to announce that i am resting.
that's not a problem. i'll adjust the pace based on the actual number of players and ensure that everyone has a good time.
i like fireworks because creating incredible fireworks makes me feel so proud of my work.
you need the encryption key, right? which captain should i bother then?
huh, really? oh, you probably mean because all the gods in this story are no longer alive.
a cat? how could i tell whether it's in a good or bad mood?
if a vision is a gift from the gods
once you get to know him, you'll realize that he's actually a big softie at heart. he'll even help out with furniture repair and painting the stage!
in any case, since you remember what happened just now well, that's put my mind at ease.
everyone in aaru village needs to take good care of themselves.
i tend to forget things -- which is why, rather than memories, i'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what i normally wouldn't otherwise. so...
oh! no, not at all! i could do with a hand, actually
sure, no hurry.
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe this is just too surreal.
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
what now? what are your plans?
we shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of penacony or the family.
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards we didn't meet seele until way later.
that would mean his time hasn't come yet. and that there is a more arduous mission for him to see through.
lil' geppie so grown up now looking down on his civilian sister
the answer is: there is no difference. the sword pierces the body and severs its life.
according to his calculation results, the strength of the underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster.
ah i take it you're inazuman, then, miss kirara?
master of inazuma kamisato art tachi jutsu aeur" kamisato ayaka, present!delighted to make your acquaintance.
sumeru city, huh i guess it's even more impressive than here?
after the general hall opened to the public, the silvermane guards and wildfire did a follow-up investigation in the underworld.
it reminds me of a ring. i imagine crafting it, and then adding a bracelet of beads to complement its soft, lustrous glow.
i swear by this sword, victory shall be yours.
after the decision is made, if you could please shred any documentation that accumulates on the wall during the process.
i suppose pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
the mare jivari was reduced to a desolate wasteland after that big battle. or rather, it became known as the mare jivari after what happened there.
this information was left by a thaumaturge called boyang who, as you know, is the missing ancestor that i came here to investigate.
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
you mean to say that you don't trust me completely?
there you are! come on, let's go to the ceremony together!
as a clerk at the hall of karma, my knowledge on these matters is somewhat limited, but i will try my best to satisfy your curiosity. please proceed.
okay. grab the kamera, and i'll give you a scenario.
i've wondered at times what the luofu should give the nameless in return for their great deeds
anyway. you're looking for a chance to shake my will aren't you?
on my flying ability, i'm afraid i'll have to disappoint you, mister yang. the sky no longer suits me.
i can guess why: general feixiao is just too strong.
it's okay, i've thought it through if it were up to me, i'd sign the contract.
i'm good, i'm good! i'm still a youkai, after all. i turned them over to the gardes. it just took me a while to round them all up
the novel that i've been reading for a while finally reached its end. but the heroine lost her memory, and the planned wedding fell through that's so sad
they say it will suffice. experiencing the bizarre and motley dreamscape is the best reward.
the elderly king, clad in a magnificent robe sits upon the deep crimson throne before you.
hehe, come on, it isn't that difficult.
if you don't come to sumeru city often, classic floral designs aren't a bad choice. those don't really go out of style.
(but it's good to see that everything's getting "on track." there are no longer any voices of suspicion.)
*cough* it was built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa rand, and also
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
i believe that you two will come to an understanding once your journey is over.
a wool scarf, which from the looks of it probably belonged to a woman, and a hair clip why are these things here?
should you harbor any thoughts, this is the moment to bring them forth.
does not a single person dare to face me?
it's you. don't sneak up behind me next time. lucky for you i wasn't armed.
the situation has changed, and it seems that companion... has deviated from the original plan.
an assassin known for purging the chrysos heirs. i am aware.
you wouldn't stand a chance.
hmph, i only took you there to demonstrate how tense things are. somehow we only tested the waters but ended up with the catch of the day.
look at you, snooping around and sticking your nose everywhere
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact
alright, but there are doors all over the place which one should we choose? do you have any idea, misha?
thanks to him, i'm able to make time for the people. i do my best to make sure that they have everything they need at the same time, i was formulating a plan to deal with svarog.
good luck! just remember, don't get knocked or launched into the air. that would be most inelegant.
how about a divination?
in the meantime, i expect the takatsukasa clan to continue supporting the kujou clan as before.
hmm. so even i, who seeks eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence
is that important? all that matters is that they work and are able to attract droidhead's attention.
we will transfer ownership of the radiant feldspar to the astral express! a meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.
come join us over here! let's share some great food and drinks, and chat about all sorts of fun things.
hold on. my lady, does this friend happen to be nilou? the one who sends flowers to the estate?
insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. but what about the long-term?
is that so? then thank you. the tenryou commission will take over from here. rest assured we will get to the bottom of the matter.
every piece of the jade chamber, from the stone walls and wooden beams down to the smallest ornament, contributed to its total weight.
don't be alarmed, this is wupei. he's wenyuan and shanghua's colleague.
who knows? cirrus said that luxie is kinda childlike -- it's worth a try.
heh you think i was joking around, huh?
dunyarzad, let me show you which stage decorations we've picked out so far. traveler and paimon, if that doesn't sound interesting to you, then feel free to explore the area.
oh? it appears that you have more skill than i thought.
like i said, the sword contains a heliobus. argenti must have been under the control of the sword! maybe he was under its control even before you arrived on the luofu.
if you live far enough out in the sticks, you have plenty of legitimate reasons to ditch work. the mountain path was blocked, or you ran into some treasure hoarders en route
beyond that, you really want to think about the proportional allocation of resources
i trust you saw this year's mingxiao lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
whether it's driving starskiffs or leading the sky-faring commission, madam yukong is always present in the xianzhou's course. i'm still lacking in my skills as a helmswoman.
i have invited you two here as friends. and when friends come over to play, our enjoyment comes first, naturally.
you're from the merchant guild?
now that you mention it, i recall that you had a teaching stint back home. any delightful stories that come to mind?
people with big dreams have big determination.
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said if you need something from us, just say the word.
hehe, that's our seele. nothing if not punctual. so, did you find any usable supplies?
very well. it's been some time since we've last shared a meal together.
yes, i have heard. seeing four leave, yet only three return, was enough for me to know that fu xuan's report was indeed correct.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
yes, no need to try and understand it. let me put this simply: right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
everyone, let's head to the central platform.
in there lurks a secret called "device ix"... one day, i'll reach it.
compared to you, i really didn't do much at all.
alright, i have to bring all of this to mister zubayr and do a little bit of prep.
oh, it just occurred to me that we should also get you a makeup box.
if only my youkai powers were stronger maybe then i'd be able to run even faster. hehe, or maybe even split myself into a ton of different clones!
you are in fact the best candidate to represent the knights of favonius.
it wouldn't be possible with a normal pathstrider.
if you could find anything that aurelie left behind perhaps we can get a better sense of what she went through in her final days.
let's go. we shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
this is life and death, okay!? you look like you can handle yourself, how come you're so lazy?
before you lies a serene stretch of open water, its surface shimmering a brilliant shade of sapphire blue.
i want to go with you, i do! i always wanted to catch a glimpse of the stellaron with my own eyes, and now it's so close
i wish i could tell you, but i still haven't figured out what it is.
he was, but not anymore.
ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the guizhong ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
there's already one lit device here. it appears that we need to find the other three and light them up as well.
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
i want to see the stellaron. i want to see the place where cocolia sacrificed herself.
this slope has a good view it'll be easy to watch the aurora.
which is why we must stop that monster before it gets any closer to liyue harbor!
my blade will lead us through the shadows.
in other words, the gates' locations are subject to change over time.
i'd give it a ninety percent chance.
i'm certain pascal won't do anything to harm anyone, but if something goes wrong
well, what are you waiting for, little one?
no one can refuse the secret of the aeons, not even zandar. we'll definitely get a response.
trust his judgment, and keep watching. we'll be right there.
just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the nihility...
there's nothing to say about your past. you only remember me because i was the one with you when your soul was born.
i look forward to experiencing it with you all.
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
hmmm "a setting sun that never sets," "a dragon that cannot fly," and "a moon that only shines at night."
when i tried to pull her out, we both got pulled in to a cold, dark place which, i soon discovered, was the border.
hee-hee, we've also never made anything this complicated before.
the data bank is very interesting. i love the entry for the mourning actors -- it's so vivid and full of details.
sparkle was disguised as sparkle's body.
but the good news is, you passed the test. the fact that you'll keep some cards close to your chest even in front of a major ally actually makes me more confident in you.
definitely more than usual, but it's because i'm worried i won't dance well enough.
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past
that shouldn't be necessary... but if it makes the nameless feel less defensive, i'll be happy to abide.
klee, did you go off by yourself without authorization again?
imagination is the source of all existence. children need only their imagination to understand the express.
since it's a classic puzzle, the answer is "people," right?
yes, when the dust settles, i'll just think of a way to recall it in the memory zone.
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
it's alright, huixin. you can stay in liyue harbor and finish your work. leave the rest to us.
*sigh* sometimes i practice over a dozen times before reporting to my superiors, but i still can't get it right
look, there are two braziers on that wall. could they be some sort of hint?
who would've thought the general would take such a liking to you? i suppose i must accompany you further fate can be so unpredictable.
drinking in liyue harbor, huh? some cover story. i'll wager they've been going to intelligence updates
fear not, mirror. you have to remember that being a genius means you're destined to solve challenge after challenge. there's no time for rest.
so, you're admitting your defeat, huh? if you're not even confident to teach, why don't you let me be the ringmaster instead?
all those years of arguments and misunderstandings can't be settled overnight. it might be best if they continue to keep some distance for now.
as for how many floors there are? well, not even us judges know for sure.
with the entire archipelago situated on a mechanical framework, it could be activated to raise each island from beneath the water.
this is a new sight for me. a rather bleak one, i must say.
you're welcome. please take care of yourself!
even to this day, this thrill still courses through me.
anyway. this may add to the debt of gratitude i owe you, but the fact is, your arrival here has rescued what was fast becoming a rather dire situation indeed.
i'm the complete march seventh with all of your forgotten memories.
remember, your first instinct is very important.
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
that would make sense. i'm sure a lot of miners are injured, right? *sigh* if everyone could just get along, things would be easier
all the outworlders arriving at xianzhou these days start their sentences with "there's an old saying in xianzhou" but a local like me can't think up any. how can this be
did you ingest the brumedew concentrate pellet i gave you?
do we have any other choice? i am starting to feel a little worn out, though
i've never doubted the master's integrity, so i'm having a real hard time rationalizing how he could ever support an infamous brigade like them.
in other words, you believe that he knew nothing of the incident?
i see so he's just as cunning and crafty as ever
we'll go over there and see what we can find out. don't worry, i don't think she's gone too far.
not long ago, i took on an assignment to clear out some nearby treasure hoarders.
hehe, well you are in the dreamscape, after all.
"the person present who shouldn't be" who could that be?
my period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. i will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
she is a top xianzhou leader mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again?
stay? but herta
can a game like this really be relaxing? i'm not convinced it's conducive to work-life balance.
thank you for your help. the culprit has revealed the location where he stashed the statues. we have sent people to collect them.
therefore, the only thing that i can do right now is to ensure that the both of you remain devoted.
are you ready? i have high standards, you know.
congratulations, you won! come on now, let's hear your victory speech.
just focus on your teaching. why bring me into this?
but not phainon. he is a chrysos heir without flaw, a perfect vessel for divinity.
in the past, every household would brew fresh wine around this time of year, and keep it sealed at least until windcoming day during the following year's weinlesefest.
if ganyu has a secret and she wishes to keep it that way, nobody should make it their business to try and get it out of her. that's just basic decency, is it not?
they do. the architects believe that hell can exist on any world -- a plight that will inevitably come to be without intervention.
qingque, i've been thinking through the calculations for this puzzle -- there really is only one solution.
should i take this to mean that you doubt the relative safety of leaving this in the hands of the tianquan?
scholars you don't know as much as i do need me to
well, you've only been practicing swordplay for fifteen days. to even reach this point is already impressive.
aventurine is telling the truth. this "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
that's fine. i'll shift to exercise mode and jog off the excess sugar.
hmm? haven't i already mentioned that i cannot make food?
(mister zubayr has been meticulously managing the theater. everything checks out.)
would you like to play on "easy mode," or "authentic mode"?
i have a gut feeling that sooner or later we'll connect all the dots and then, we'll finally know the truth.
she went toe-to-toe with the general's star pupil! i'd be pretty pleased with myself, too.
perhaps those garden folks lied to you. anyhow, i've looked up the name amphoreus in the simulated universe. though clearly irrelevant results have already been filtered out
life is short, and i'm happy i got to be a part of that operation.
in other words do you want to try my home-made matcha?
the next time we have an important policy decision on our hands, i'd like you to get involved.
alas, questions like that are above my pay grade. that is for the ten lords and the general to figure out.
the law only judges criminal behavior, and does not weigh human emotion. the court's verdict can settle the question of criminal liability, but
you can find an abbreviated version of the rules printed on the back of your character card. if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
do not be mistaken. i speak only in the interests of fairness.
please hand over your "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder" as evidence. we will compensate you for your loss once we catch the individual responsible.
i sincerely wish that this will be our last meeting.
so, even the blazing beasts were
so essentially, you're gathering information to help you solve the riddles, correct? i'll do my best to help.
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
my, someone rather discerning fitted out this shrine.
please also deliver this message to the ministry of civil affairs.
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. i reject the concept of ownership because i don't want the responsibilities that come with it.
i wasn't sure. it was just a hunch, but since misha feels familiar with this place my hunch might be correct.
now that the fading disorder is cured, i'm sure the forest will be a lively place again in no time.
y'know what, you're right -- we should work these things out on our own
additionally, the fact that the borisin need medicine to disguise themselves suggests that there are still moles within the alchemy commission assisting them covertly.
do not merely cast your protective gaze upon the land. instead, focus your sights on our city and each of the citizens that dwell within it.
kujou kamaji is wounded. descendants of the takatsukasa clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
but given the present circumstances, i'm afraid i must regretfully decline your casting request.
bronya! i don't know what happened between you and them. even if you explained it to me, i probably wouldn't understand all the crazy details. but there are two things i do know
hehe, fireworks aren't just for festivals y'know.
oh, and there'll be a cameo for mister kamisato and miss yoimiya as well. they'll be used to show outsider perspectives on the fates of the two musketeers.
i'm fine, really. i just got into a few skirmishes down in the underworld, but nothing i couldn't handle.
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means
they often gossip about the latest issues of serialized novels, or the gossip on who has a crush on whom
for our next stop, i'd like to take you both for a meal.
phonographs...they use vinyl records, right? there's only a handful of folks on the space station who collect those things.
huh? hold up, i wasn't that late
while that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
allow me to eliminate these obstacles, dragon lady stand back, the chill of my sword freezes everything in its path.
ah, i wouldn't go that far it's just that mister afshin is really good at spinning stories. a word from him, and you'll find yourself buying things you don't actually need.
so what are you all doing here? do you need something?
alas, why is your face turning pale, yanqing?
wait, hat guy, what's that sword around your waist?
no, i'm aware of your strength, traveler. the power hidden within you is not inferior to mine.
walking alone in the darkness, fearing every incoming, invisible obstacle, unable to understand other people's descriptions
i understand how you feel, navia, but we have to change venues for the next part of the story, anyway.
so pascal used to be a robot guardian of rivet town
i'm willing to make an exception, considering you're guests from beyond the sky. but if i were to bring both of you in at once i'd be blatantly disrespecting our traditions.
tingyun has informed me of the purpose of your visit. receiving guests isn't normally one of my responsibilities
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
partings are inevitable, of course, but distance makes the heart grow fonder, right?
hey, let me ask you something
you're right, but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
besides, the yae publishing house will need your help with the illustrations again next time, mister calx. you could also consider it as my investment in you.
how much longer can you last with your current supplies?
makoto saw a bigger picture than i did. in her view, a "dream" is more imaginary, more abstract than an "ambition."
i understand. thank you for your words of encouragement, mister khasani.
so, this must be an adepti abode hmm, though it's a bit different from what i imagined, it's still most fascinating.
in other words, if we hold here, there's nothing worse to come, right?
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
it's been a long time since i last came to this village. there's been a lot to deal with recently
i do hope the knights of favonius are all working hard
ah, i should make myself clear. when i said a hundredth of a lifetime
even if the world outside the cage isn't beautiful people still want to know what it's like.
the memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. but when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
hey, that's pretty good! i'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
okay, let's get moving. we should head back to the village and rest up. today was just a trial run aeur" noon tomorrow is gonna be the hard part.
the general sent for craftsmen, and they concluded that the sound came from the shipyard facilities in stargazer navalia.
yep. you pick, red or blue?
this is your future that elio has foreseen. do you like it?
since there is such a great deal of difference between the story and the reality, i don't feel offended at all. on the contrary, i find the author's powers of imagination quite admirable.
i hope that everyone will guard your stations and perform your duties, both for our far-flung colleagues involved in the expedition, and also for the hardworking people of mondstadt.
while the position of tianquan remains mine, i will always ensure liyue's safety.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them
it's just i haven't found enough clues yet. the thief is really tricky. they haven't left any traces in the dwelling
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
i've seen the ipc's approach -- they prioritize efficiency and a standard uniform business model across the galaxy.
i must say that amber's development has impressed me recently. i hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale.
that's okay. these components are really common. maybe we can find a spare one in the ruins around here.
when our workload is light, my coworkers sometimes organize social events.
i know that you're good people. you helped a lot of the injured in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies.
now that we're done with our tour of the skysplitter, shall we continue with our training?
this handwritten fan reply card!
what do you think? is the food to your liking?
a familiar flavor acceptable.
combat is like smelting -- purging the impurities with burning flames and exposing a person's true nature.
having a dojo in one's home is akin to placing one's sword on the table. it is a reminder to never be negligent.
that's called a united front, got it?!
in her eyes, the most precious things in this world were dreams aeur" the yearning for a better future held by living beings.
wow, matsuzaka, nice work! it's not easy to beat itto
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
i wouldn't be surprised if there are the silvermane guards have a lot to make amends for down here.
thanks, but no. i want something to help keep me awake.
actually, i do understand what you meant, lisa.
normally, i have to make a special request to the chef if i want it to taste like this.
alright, alright, i see.
i know jiaoqiu always wants me to know my limits and not get carried away, but now is the time to bring this to a swift end.
on the xianzhou, short-life species like us have a fleeting existence, here one moment and gone the next. that's all the more reason to seize the moment while you still have it!
you saw it all for yourselves. i'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
perfect, then we'll leave it as-is. i'll go make an official copy.
traveler, take care of paimon. yanfei, you might need to come closer to me when the time comes.
it looks like this gate has a more complicated structure than the last one
the part that was corroded is irreversible, so the space station will always be in a state of quasi-fragmentum.
i bet you've got nothing better on your mind!
don't worry, i am not reckless, and i won't carelessly alert the thieves. you can certainly trust me by now.
still, you did end up victorious. i gather congratulations are in order.
because no matter where i've gone, i've always been surrounded by incredible kindness.
pretty sharp, aren't you, chicken wing boy?
we can move out any time. let me know when you're ready.
little miss pink what's that supposed to mean!?
this is only the first step in making a greeting. after addressing one another, you then exchange courtesies.
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know
good! with this much power, i daresay even the acting grand master herself would be no match for me!
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
worry not. i'm capable of handling it, trinnon.
i'm just clearing the stage for the grand entrance -- can't have you three misbehaving in front of the luofu's hotshot general.
i made a laughingstock out of myself. i might've spent too much time away from work aeur" my intuition is not as accurate as it used to be.
but the best-laid plans of snow mice and men often go awry they didn't realize the parts would interfere with the robots' systems and cause them to run amok.
that's why grandpa hid it from me, so i wouldn't make a hasty decision
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
somehow, i feel even more tense after playing a few matches than i did before
madam faruzan here's pretty friendly aeur" when she heard that we were buying clothes, she decided to give us some help.
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
come now, did you really think we wouldn't notice you sneaking around?
our first priority is finding the thief and recovering the stolen item, but we don't even have a suspect yet that's why this case is such a conundrum for the silvermane guards.
it seems only fitting for someone of your status.
and maybe we are don't get too close, or you might turn into a ghost too.
the puppet, yes. i've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
since two of our players are doing this for the first time, though, let me ask
oleg has always acted on my behalf -- he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the underworld.
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
hmm i give it a nine point eight!
no matter what happens, we'll stand as one.
we'll be fine! for us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
you spent so much time in belobog on your last visit -- you must have passed by here before, right?
i see that you've recovered the lifeform in the master control zone. thank you, well done.
it'd be so nice if all my work could just do itself without me having to lift a finger
after all i'm not doing this on my own, right?
gotcha, thanks so much. we'll be on our way.
i've been here many times in my life, but the scenery can never fully reveal itself to me.
first we need to find out who's supporting him don't worry, i've got a plan.
master masakatsu aeur" how do you feel? can you hold on?
alright then. feel free to take a look around the venue before it kicks off.
they set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
greetings, my honored preceptor. it's been a while since we last touched base. i've brought a friend with me today. i believe you're already familiar with each other.
he was loud and foolish, with no real sense of purpose. instead of doing anything useful, he spent most of his time drinking and chasing after women.
of course, it's always a pleasure to be in your company.
initially, i thought this might just be another case of a merchant hoarding goods in hopes of maximizing their profits. but once i heard more, i realized it must be the thief you are after.
in the other spaces, the fantastic compass was always partially buried in the ground. but this one is lying flat, intact as if somebody left it here.
makes sense. we went crazy and couldn't control ourselves i like the way you think.
traveler, please escort the treasure hoarders back to qingce village and hand them over to the millelith stationed there.
i'd say that ningguang's purpose is to request that the savior of mondstadt take a more neutral stance or at least, to not wholly side with the adepti.
one, no, two empty liquor bottles ugh, tell me you guys, are these the kinds of things that a normal person would leave behind?
also, please allow me to ask, as the final question before the trial begins
although he claims to be a special guest for the irodori festival, he's failed to present his invitation letter. therefore, we can only suspect that he might've entered the country illegally.
dunn, this concerns the fate of belobog -- no -- the fate of our whole world. please don't stand in our way
of course i've read it! i've always had a keen interest in artistic works that strike a chord with the populace.
every day, i try to figure out how to repair some of them and return the robots to normal. except there are a lot more than mister svarog and i can handle on our own.
i am sorry for our improper management, and i truly appreciate your assistance, general.
give me a few minutes, just a few. i'll explain every--
i'm not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that's my take on the matter.
as it happens, i was just having a discussion on backup plans with my secretaries before you arrived.
but if you're still going to cling onto your so-called mercenaries' pride, then i'll give you all a good beating as well.
stellarly brutal! you've attained the skills of a semi-emanator when it comes to reciting the ninja mantra!
well, uhh you do look very different from other people.
if i may be so bold to ask, is this borisin truly that formidable?
that was when ei began to change. makoto was her greatest loss.
although i don't think anyone will have any objections.
i'm sure some people here see the idea of someone coming to poisson dressed as the hydro archon as extremely disrespectful.
if you're not too tired, gepard, can i talk to you for a moment?
hold your horses, cowboy. it's for those to decide.
huh? but there's no need for you to get caught up in this mess, too.
i thought the general's retainers were all burly martial masters. i didn't expect yanqing to be so
there's nothing personal in it -- have a read if you like.
i accept your challenge, hoolay. because the very moment you stepped aboard the skysplitter, you stepped onto your path to ruin.
i heard the wardance is about to be held in the mortal world. i remember watching a sword duel at the wardance with my sister when we were young.
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate
the debt that vache owes to the underworld rests with me. all i can do is help everyone to the best of my ability to the very end.
i just stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
the thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free oh, i just couldn't wait any longer.
amber, you're being far too formal. the child is never going to remember all that.
let me know if you see her, alright? i'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. she always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!
i suppose this is the new way of life, then. i'm not going to complain. i'll try to embrace it.
should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
and in your plans, the ipc always wins. even if you lose the bet... to the family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.
so help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
with a more powerful shogun, i will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
way i see it, if they were clever enough, they would conceal the stolen goods somewhere and then come pick them up later.
i can sense your enthusiasm for the space station, but i'm afraid i have to turn you away.
everyone at the grand bazaar loves lesser lord kusanali, and we're all looking forward to the sabzeruz festival.
well, why make "omni" money when you can make ordinary money first~?
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes they must have come through here.
yo, it's you! you're interested in the supernatural, right?
oh? well what did you want to ask?
well, i didn't, but i wanted to do something memorable with you, so i got my friends at the grand bazaar to help me learn in secret.
aha, i see. herta's collections aren't in the system, so anything unaffected should be our target.
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
sorry, my bad but it's not too late! you can order anything you want!
even though she will one day seize your vision, too?
have you ever seen anyone outside of the crew interact with misha?
whenever they heard that melody, they would feel like their lives were in danger once again, and flee immediately.
as for how we'll communicate with lynxy in the future we'll have to have a good think about it.
if we can make the businesses more profitable, then maybe we have a chance of paying back the ipc?
do you still remember the "no man's land" i mentioned? i'm considering a solo trip back there during my research downtime, just to see how things are.
um what's going on?
hehe, i was kidding. was that surprising? i can crack jokes every now and then, too. i just rarely see the need.
health is everything -- you won't be much use if you neglect yours. let wildfire take care of the furnace core for now. you head back and recuperate.
please, the honor is all mine. i was profoundly moved to hear about your troupe and your wonderful director. i just wanted to do something to help.
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
if it were me, i'd just leave him be for a couple of days. he'll recover on his own soon enough.
they're referring to our mascot's true form.
oh no, we were supposed to chat together, but i've been doing all the talking
do you remember the invite that the express received?
is there still anything unresolved or strange that we should try to consider?
that's why there was a flaw in your dream. in other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
but, the closer we get to the final battle, the more worried i feel you have an ancient name now, but the ode of resurrection only takes effect if you win.
the goal is to see how much mora we can make under these conditions.
no, the disaster is over, but my dreams never lie
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
huh? but didn't you just say that you had something important to do?
so should we tell everyone the deal?
would you like to be the first person in my audience today?
my grandfather told me that, back when he was a boy, children learned the art of kite-making step by step from their elders.
i hope the name, ningguang, will live on, but not as a person. as more of a symbol.
if what mister norbert said is true, then our safest option is to send a civilian to try to reach out to mister cold feet and lure him out of his lair.
aggregating the path energy of the erudition, then firing a "bond" at the aeon. this is as good as tapping someone on the shoulder, who's sure to turn back to look at you.
i'm sure you must find it quite odd that all these everyday items could fetch such a huge price at auction.
that is something i agree on.
sure, i'd be happy to do that for you.
when i held your hand just now, i could sense that you've got a great affinity for phlogiston. you're extraordinarily gifted.
there was a huge shaking just now coming up through the ground. mister svarog said it must have been
i've captured the nature of the medicine in my censer.
in your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. come on, off we go.
at first, i wasn't completely serious about using the opportunity to travel abroad to see a meteor shower
he also installed a secret compartment in the wine pot he bought to hold the poison. as the amount of liquor went down, he'd shake the pot to release the poison from the compartment into the liquor.
but even so, they are due a resolution i owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
the real dunyarzad? where? and who are you talking to?
it doesn't bother me. i just hope she didn't make you feel too awkward
is it that obvious?
if it'll make you feel better i can avert my gaze.
i thought it would turn out poorly because i felt rather rigid. but it actually looks much more natural than i'd imagined.
perhaps in a few years or maybe a few decades when belobog's weather stabilizes, i'll suggest that bronya construct a railway in the city.
your performance at the theme park was wonderful and grandiose... a simple yet practical technique that fooled almost everyone.
really? you're gonna say yes just like that?
what's the rush, chicken wing boy? did i get to you?
by the look on your face i'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
i always get people asking me how my workshop makes money when it's not trading. use your brain! it doesn't!
anyway, thanks for the suggestions! they all have something about them. i'll have to think about it
i always wondered -- how did he, a rich kid with virtually no real life experience, suddenly think of becoming a smuggler?
she clearly not a pathstrider of the hunt. but you are, aren't you? tell me, what's acheron's deal?
hmph that's because you're not from my tribe. you don't know how many delusions of grandeur i've destroyed just by existing!
the name of the lawrence clan member in question is schubert. lately, he can often be found strolling near the northern city walls.
there is something else he cares more about and needs -- or should i say, is verifying.
you are phainon and mydei's companion. so long as they're willing to entrust you with their lives, my trust in you doesn't matter.
but he did invite you to tea, didn't he?
my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
that's where you come in. your descriptions can explain everything in full, vivid detail.
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
aw, thanks, but i'm just your average artisan. the quiet life suits me better.
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
bennett, weren't you feeling dizzy too? stop pushing yourselves, both of you. get some rest, we'll continue when you've gathered your energy.
well, how is it? are you enjoying the feast today? if there's anything you're unhappy with, just let me know. i'll be sure to take note of it.
go ahead and talk to the buyers. they'll give you the answers you're looking for.
but if you're interested, there's a shop selling jade abacus jewelry in starskiff haven -- i can show you around when i'm free.
i vow to take down a lord ravager and teach the ruin legion the true meaning of the hunt.
then, you should understand. nearly everyone you know will be gone one day.
i mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. you don't need to look after me
anything special about that name?
after all, a life with no obstacles tends to narrow the mind. people end up believing that only they are on the right path. sometimes, obstacles are more valuable than smooth sailing.
well then, please look over this tax record. we'll review second life's credit based on your observations.
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
and you will die. i mean... all of you will.
unfortunately, since i didn't manage to procure one for myself, i'm unable to say for sure.
there's supposed to be a passage why can't i see it?
nor is daring to make me personally concerned about his safety. hmph, he has no idea what's coming to him.
don't forget to rest! you guys have got a busy day ahead of you!
will you stand with us as we reestablish our contracts aeur" as we build a new age of prosperity?
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
after a quick discussion, you nod to the guards and agree to follow. they lead you all the way to the audience hall of the palace.
i still don't wish to pretend to be someone else, but i do have a desire to express myself so maybe the show will go on for me after all.
after all, it is a lot to live up to.
you are indeed.. dreaming.
it appears i was overthinking things. impulsive behavior is pretty characteristic of her after all.
sorry. i couldn't hear you clearly. could you repeat that?
that's right! for us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
i should go back and give that place a spring-clean sometime. never know when it might prove useful again
jiaoqiu always said i'm the most impatient person among the cloud knights, and i can't argue with that. so there's no reason for you to be more anxious than me.
you shouldn't ignore them, by the way. very often, they're an omen of something terminal.
if we manage to convince her, i'm quite sure we'll be able to get you another audience with the raiden shogun.
follow your instinct. choose whichever windblume you see fit.
what fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet? i sincerely look forward to them.
talanton surrendered their coreflame, though the chrysos heir taking over their legacy is nowhere to be found today.
it'll be of more use here, where it can protect this bottle domain, and the dreams of all who journey through here.
mm in that case, shall we continue our conversation at the shrine of sangonomiya?
silent but deadly are you sure that nickname isn't annoying you?
sink deeper and do this once more. submerge your wrists in the spirit water. familiarize yourself with its temperature, its touch
you also can't forget to keep your guard up in case of troublemakers
i, bronya rand, the nineteenth guardian of belobog, hereby take my oath
i'd love to know where you picked this thing up.
i know, silver wolf. just give me another minute.
so, this is the past of the kalevalan people's sword of heroes? you helped the people of that world bring an end to war?
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
oh, she had a bunch of codenames. i heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked
sorry, i'm afraid there's not much i can do for you -- our task this time is just to "place" the target properly.
well then, i'm glad you learned something. you're already halfway toward mastering aristocratic conduct.
if slaying him is our only choice, i will gladly become the knight that leads the charge.
shouldn't this be expected of a memokeeper?
i once felt regret for those that were lost without a trace, but fortunately, we were later able to sense, discover, and preserve them.
good, i'm glad i could be of some help.
dear benefactors, i extend my heartfelt gratitude to you.
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
the master diviner must have launched the campaign while we were delayed in the artisanship commission.
and now, i will reclaim everything i have lost. and it should begin with a proper acknowledgment--
with this, the debt between the traveling merchant and me is clear.
without the sacred sakura, inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
the truth is we are on the same side.
leyla must have used this as his medium. it would definitely explain how a spirit-duffer like him was able to trigger a clairvoyant experience.
i wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
you've made an exceptional contribution toward the building of the new jade chamber.
yes, i better think about aventurine's proposal.
it's a common trope in light novels, right? you just have to have a bit of bravado. as soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
to be honest, i think you could've handled it yourself.
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason
hmm sounds like the voice is coming from inside the train.
to survive hardship, you must prepare for hardship.
well, that's obvious, but what i truly wanted to know is: this project is obviously too bland for your taste, isn't it?
this projector is a limited-edition version custom-made for the museum -- the only one of its kind in the whole of belobog. it can produce images with a resolution of up to
wonderful. then i'll see you in three days. i look forward to it very much.
i'm good, everything seems normal
sorry, no can do. without the slip for reference, i can't make the same one again, and i'm afraid sakujirou is the one with the slip.
you have many good qualities, collei. i bet if you had to learn dance since childhood like myself, then you'd be an even better dancer than me.
hold still and don't move three, two, one
i stared out at the sea for goodness knows how long i just couldn't let it go i just couldn't.
the platform on the right is missing an iron ball
ah, sorry to hear that. i'll be sure to bring him some great liquor next time i left in a hurry, and i couldn't make it back in time for the event.
...a fitting metaphor for the nameless' trailblazing spirit.
it looks very happy. perhaps you could try petting it?
--they are not scum!
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left
how was she? did you deliver the medicine?
*sigh* don't worry, i won't dig too deep. i know bronya must have thought long and hard before deciding what to make public.
you're too kind. actually, i think we could learn a lot more from your talents. that's why we can place so much trust in you.
hahaha, okay, enough serious talk. days off are few and far between, so it'd be a waste not to unwind while i still can.
most of those so-called "great heroes" were heartless killers. they are only called heroes because they won.
the book glimpses into the beyond describes it as "living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown."
but all they're really after are my words any morsel of information that may hint at liyue's future commercial trends.
mornings are good, aren't they? they are the start of a new day, which means there is plenty of time left to rest some more.
it is an honor to meet everyone.
ah, i don't intend to spoil the fun. sometimes, protecting dreams and fantasies is more important than exposing the truth, don't you think?
me? have we met?
remember the current affairs and planning stage of the assessment? since the successful candidate is duty bound to implement their plan after taking office, their manifesto tells us their stance on key issues.
hmm, an underground space with an entrance but no exit it just doesn't make any sense. i'll figure something out, just give me some time.
they're already awake in their rooms. will you be comfortable in following me now? time waits for no one. we must hurry to the lobby.
alright! when people ask you, you might as well tell them this loud and clear.
well, either way, i will do my best to remain vigilant.
well, i've done my part, and now i'm simply waiting for the fireworks to begin.
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
i still occasionally practice suturing on my old teddy bear, just like in the old days.
you already know its story, so i won't go into too much detail. my main reason for being here is merely to witness your decision.
i don't have suggestions, only an opinion, and that is "he's a hopeless workaholic."
oh no, xianzhou divination is nothing like the superstitious scams you see elsewhere. it's based on a technology called the jade abacus.
i had a lot of fun during those days.
and, as a memokeeper, i also have to fulfill my responsibilities and harvest some interesting memories.
they're not foxians at all. they revealed their true form. they're borisin, just like the bandits i defeated on the ipc ship.
okay. i need forty portions of knights' special northern smoked chicken, and forty of favonius-favored pile 'em up
is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
even the most ferocious beasts still protect their own. it sounds like they've thrown that straight to the wind.
he also said that he will "take care of everything" before he leaves. what did he mean by that? we need to be extra careful when dealing with a person like him.
besides, the sword seems scared of its own master. i'd like to ask him - you claim to cherish your sword as your life, yet you don't even recognize the state it's in right now?
the wisdom and experience you've accumulated over ten amber eras are truly impressive.
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence
that was some impressive cloud knight spearmanship. which unit are you from?
new allies of okhema, welcome to amphoreus.
please forgive my lack of courtesy for receiving you in this fashion especially following such a long and wearisome journey over the sea.
regardless whose idea it was this place has been designated as a restricted area. no one is allowed to enter.
of course. to honor martial arts, the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
hmm so should we also take those skills, then?
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us
oh wow, we seem to be crossing paths a lot lately where could i have seen you before? can you figure it out?
the main consideration for you is how to make the best use of the available space
in other words, even though you didn't exactly choose to be our apprentice, you still need to take the initiative during this learning process.
...if we can start investigating on the way, that'd be good.
the answer is... when they are in desperate situations.
this is a world dominated by titans. and that order can only be toppled by the chrysos heirs.
are you leaving? this old town is too dangerous. we'll accompany you part of the way.
um well, i'd get them to the shore, and then i'd probably hide behind a tree and watch them for a while
well, no one has ever asked me this before, so i've never really settled on an answer.
she takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
well would you believe me if i said yes?
the fount of knowledge and boldness of spirit that your travels have bequeathed upon you are sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
that would be ping. you probably know her as "madame ping."
if it was any other day, that would be your next logical step. but today, you've got me on your team, so you get an extra tip.
i believe it's not something external, but something that originates within us, an emotion that traverses time from a certain moment of our past to reach us.
i, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
if you're interested, go pay her a visit. you may be just the help she needs.
change of plan. i've decided to stay in belobog.
the report did mention abnormalities in the surveillance system and module errors... we'll have to start prioritizing those issues.
looks normal enough on the surface let's take a closer look.
gotta have another slogan for this one.
doesn't look like there are any more clues. let's head back to the crime scene.
well technically we didn't find all the parts, and if we called in the experts to put it back together, they would have realized
i especially love velvet coats, they're so fragile and beautiful. difficult to maintain -- you only have to be a tiny bit careless to ruin the sheen.
but if we didn't take care of those monsters, what were you planning to do? just stay here, shaking in your boots?
all these years, and the view at the alchemy commission hasn't changed a bit.
the akademiya has never liked us, and they've never respected our work. to them, what we do is all a waste of time.
i did say that if a danger proved too great for you, i would personally step in to confront it.
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
however, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
um, no need. i'll handle the clinic. i assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
oh? you want to learn more about the gates? well, as you heard earlier, the gates are basically eight key nodes in liyue's ley line network.
well i'm still me. there is no doubt about that.
looks like everyone can't wait. let's go ahead with that plan, then. i will submit the admission documents to paperfold university. we'll leave once everyone is ready. let's all have some fun.
economic cooperation between our islands has suffered greatly as a consequence. few merchants are now willing to engage in inter-island commerce.
i'm afraid not. you may or may not have heard, but fontaine once played host to a group known as the marechaussee hunters.
then i should do my best to honor it.
over the years, the destruction's minions have wreaked havoc on countless worlds, and the alliance has been keeping an eye on them. but no one expected them to join hands with the remnants of the abundance.
don't take svarog as an ordinary robot. he's, uh special.
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
to be clear, i have no intention to hide that which i do out of reverence alone. but there is one thing you must be corrected on.
we've arrived. there's an elevator here, just like in the lobby. we should be able to reach our destination with it.
mm-hmm. we'll meet them formally soon. before that, let me run you through the assessment process.
let's see hmm oh, looks like you each have enough points to choose one final skill.
according to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
sure thing, mister skott. you seem pretty confident that your career and life will last long enough to witness this victory unfold.
you should talk to amber and bennett. they're not as well acquainted with dragonspine as i am.
they bicker and fight, but they'll always be your biggest supporters.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
the plan was never a secret. or, i guess i should say there was no point to keeping it a secret. a simple investigation from ororon would reveal everything.
where are you going, benefactors?
well, it's almost time. let's send her home.
behind my back? do you really think you could've walked into the test and sat in the cockpit if i hadn't given my permission behind the scenes?
so you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "the miraculous adventures of the traveler."
thank you so much, both of you. i'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
all things are impermanent, this departure may be our final farewell. may your way of the ninja be ever courageous and enduring. until we meet again!
do you not see whose name it is on the desk? hmph, i can come and go as i wish. besides, if anyone is going to leave, it definitely won't be me.
oh? she heads up the force? hm not bad.
but those things are all in the past.
i hope it will help us save dvalin, like venti says.
if you're looking to meet her, the lunarescent depths might be your best bet. i spotted her heading that way earlier.
uhh, that was me copying video titles from the hottest streamers on the luofu i heard they help attract more viewers.
your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. i imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
i think i've figured out what's motivated march to learn swordplay.
then i'll wait for you over there. there's still some good news that i'd like share with chevreuse.
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
a proper manner of speech is more aesthetic than anything else aeur" it stems from their taste for refinement.
why isn't svarog helping you?
you'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
in this universe, there exist countless worlds that are similar yet different, and countless people who are alike yet distinct.
i didn't expect to meet a fan here. i'm honored. welcome to penacony, a world filled with wonderful dreams.
should you take a liking to them, i'll make sure to prepare more next time.
she said not to open it until we've reached the islands. i think it might be something to use in case of an emergency.
well, the competition for survival went two ways -- shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom, and failure to take proper precautions cost many a hunter their life.
oh, before i forget navia, the short sword you had with you earlier
that's why he joined wangsheng funeral parlor. in place of a salary, i'm helping him deal with this matter.
hey, enough pessimism! back in my "official capacity" days, i spent a lot of time in the north -- i got to know the soldiers and officers on the front line very well.
hmm, you've got a point. hey, what would you do if you woke up tomorrow with more money than you could ever spend?
now then. the schedule. let's see what you have for me today.
okay, i'm sorry but sometimes when you're out on a limb, you gotta double down to seal the deal, you know?
representatives of all parties, please be ready to brief the review committee on your business plans.
you don't know? but surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
heh, looks like your general hasn't told you to stop hopping around like a sparrow in a fight, huh?
it's been a while. how have you been? i can't say i've been doing well lately myself, but that's normal for me.
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
don't worry. diamond has always trusted us. i'll put in a good word for you, and you'll have your pforty-five position back in no time.
and where are all the soldiers we saw in the port just now?
i don't know what scheme northland bank has in the works, and i don't know what they're paying you.
the issue isn't the projector, but the microfilm that goes into it. it's the most crucial piece of this exhibit, and it was stolen.
yes. when customers are done eating, they can come to the alley for a stroll.
your master yanqing wasn't as lucky. he's probably still in bed
this is a human society aeur" at the moment, anyway aeur" and i'm just doing as i please.
we really don't know how that happened.
i am ningguang, tianquan of qixing. you wish to trade? you be my personal bodyguard, and i will show you how to get ahead in liyue.
please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, and solemnly kneel to the ground with utmost sincerity.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go
the wind that blows from afar carries fresh life to these shores
before i lost my memory so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
i wouldn't want general jing yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
i will return to the kujou encampment and plan our defenses for the other regions.
no, in fact, i should say, she's hiding everything from us.
*sigh* spare me. beautiful eyes though -- are you from sigonia?
peace soon returned to the capital. those in the court manipulated by the sorcerer also recognized the errors of their ways
according to the plan, we should first go to pardis dhyai, and ask for forest watcher tighnari.
to make sure these ten boxes fit within one another, i had to meticulously measure them -- it would've been a bust if i was off by even one millimeter!
finally, we have lady bailu of the alchemy commission. she loves excitement.
she's one of the souls that overflowed from the night kingdom. she can no longer go back there.
no. every name on that tablet made the same choice. all hunters know what the path entails.
that means mavuika doesn't have to just sacrifice herself to the ruler of death. she can still use her death to get something in return.
hmph! i'll remember your unwillingness to comply! mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
but arlan doesn't have any other bosses -- who else would it be? march, he asked to accompany you so he could learn how to manage his stress, right?
ah! i've figured it out! i heard a loudmouthed guard say that a group of outsiders had met with cocolia you must be them?
imagine if we didn't suspect anything. by the time zhiyi recommends the blackcliff forge for the excavation project, at most we would maybe do a fresh background check on the place.
while i trust the bravery of the divine foresight and the nameless, i'm curious about some details missing from the report. i'd like to take this chance to have an exchange with both of you.
and patience happens to be one of my greatest strengths. so now, do you understand what you must give up, miss samuel? or should i address you as
lady bailu has small hands but is very skilled i have to go lie down and have a massage with her every time i return to the luofu.
i see it too -- let's go.
since i'm just an ordinary person now. they'll probably just laugh in my face if i go asking them for help
there's no end to this. let me try.
as in, disappear from the ley lines completely, never to be seen again aeur" taking the banished evil along with them.
mondstadt is independent, and does not belong to any other nation.
paimon's right. we should take advantage of the clear weather to reassess our situation.
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
apologize for what? you know, you and me have a lot in common. i'm almost a grown-up now, but i still miss my childhood days and running about barefoot.
i hope you have an amazing journey, serval. do remember to visit home when you get the chance.
not exactly. actually, we--
try to keep all that in mind of course, it doesn't really matter if you forget, since we'll be assessing them at yuehai pavilion in a short while.
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
ah, hello little ones. i take it you have received my commission, hmm?
the corps of thirty is in charge of the city's defenses, but we already talked to asfand. they've been fed up with the sages bossing them around.
us silvermane guards have fought against the fragmentum for far too long and have lost too much even though you've solved the stellaron problem for now, the number of casualties is still staggering.
in fact, i chose this job from the very start because i knew it'd be right up my alley.
oh am i understanding this correctly? a masked fool, inviting me to work together?
i'm not sad. it's just that this dream is so loving and forgiving.
every so often, you see him glance toward a particular direction with a pained expression on his face, as if an invisible thread is tying him to an unknown place.
yes indeed. and they are some of my most reliable helpers and friends.
thunder is kinda scary. are you afraid of it? if so, i can share a nifty method to help with that.
didn't think you were the type to get bored sure, speak.
that lasted up until around twenty or thirty years ago, when strange things started happening. people started speaking of an enormous, dark creature the size of a mountain roaming inside the mare jivari
that's the kind of treasure i've always yearned for, but the general's position won't allow him to accept such a gift.
so i would advise you to be cautious.
soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
that you choose to show up here proves that you have more bravery in you than i had originally thought. and now that you are here, i have a proposal
i see i'm glad they're all safe and sound. i can try to use my magic to fold a boat to bring everyone back.
our top priority is to find albedo and razor. do you know which direction they went?
young man, if you wish to apprehend someone, shouldn't you have a reason?
also, please stop making it sound as if i somehow need the company.
like right now for example. it's just about time my final "guest" boarded the ship.
any evidence he's left is not going to be immediately obvious. we'll have to look carefully, and think critically.
yeah, i guess so i still feel like my audience will see them as ghosts, to be honest.
the disciples of sanctus medicus were in hiding for so long now they finally show their face. did the master diviner fail to foresee this?
no. you're way too dangerous. i don't mind personally, but i don't want asta and others to take the risk.
some spiritfarers occasionally use ingenia from the artisanship commission to navigate the treacherous terrain here.
that makes sense to me monsieur neuvillette, i would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
it's just that, because of their local customs, the native people choose not to leave.
okay, then let's meet back here in three days.
hello. none of you seem surprised by my arrival.
the sky-faring commission has reserved rooms for you at the petrichor inn. when you finish your business here, how about some tea together?
no, i've thought about it. she deserves a day off.
shh! don't distract me when i'm checking the puppet's parameters. #twenty-seven fifty-seven
and if you're feeling a little tired, lie down on the seats instead. the universe is fascinating from every angle.
i'm still not sure how you first got your hands on this information, so play it safe when you get back. don't mention to anyone that you ran into me out here.
are any of the paths in this world easy to tread?
besides, everyone knows that the main difference between a human and a god is the possession of "authority." gods can do what humans cannot aeur" that's why they're worshipped as gods.
oh, yes! that's the one. i remember when he drank it aeur" hee-hee, i've never seen him enjoy a bottle of wine so much in his life! he was telling me all night about how good it tasted.
no doubt. i figured that out back in the underworld.
i wouldn't say that -- a good businesswoman doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve. besides, the alliance has weathered plenty of challenges. we can handle this situation.
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
in other words, even though i can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, i can still send you to where ei is.
how can words suffice? hmm in this world, seeing is believing.
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
but let's stay calm until we're one hundred% sure.
he's as stubborn as i am. it could be an argument or a fight -- he'll do both to the death that's why he bugs the heck out of me!
umm, that depends on the higher-ups. if there are still civilians to evacuate, then i'll need to come back.
okay guys, take a look over here: this is everwinter monument. it was erected to commemorate the mighty architects.
under the might of an aeon, the sacrifices of ordinary creatures are but a joke we are nothing we mean nothing
for my brother, orders are more important than anything. even if you stuck bronya's letter to his forehead, he wouldn't be swayed.
but unfortunately, you probably didn't learn much from those conversations. it seems we have no other choice but to find more people to talk to.
i gotta admit, i had a lot of misunderstandings about the silvermane guards. they're fighting for survival here every day, just like wildfire.
to be brutally honest for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
well, you're just as good at comforting people as mister moze.
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
unlike the outside world, what inazuma seeks is eternity. in other words, a state of tranquility, where very little ever changes.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape
i received bronya's message before the inauguration ceremony. she told me everything that happened north of belobog -- about the stellaron, and cocolia's sacrifice
that was when i saw you. you didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
why, i wouldn't miss it for the world -- seeing as you put so much work into everything.
uh, speaking of which, why haven't i seen a single village keeper since i got here?
the reports look pretty normal today. you can go have some rest.
i'd like to repay you when i'm done with the work at hand. what would you say if i accompanied you on one of your trips?
you mentioned the stellaron
this is bad news. i don't think sakujirou had enough time to make his mind up
this show will be a special one. we're holding it in cesar's honor.
well, how could they expect to attract people to come and watch if they didn't make a huge spectacle? march, you haven't forgotten what you came to do, have you?
we can't give up. right now, our number one priority has to be getting out of here alive.
if the people of today can derive enjoyment from this activity, they will not only be more likely to better appreciate the tradition, but also to pass it down to the people of tomorrow.
oh yeah? since you're so familiar with the place, you can lead the way and conduct the interviews!
hey, march. that's a big smile on your face -- what's the good news?
hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in inazuma. they even handed out flyers in front of yae publishing house.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
you'll see shortly. the one who spent the most money will surely be the quickest to realize.
it's a cinch. this music box -- the "invitation" received by the annihilation gang there are latent memories that linger on it yet.
hehe, it strikes me that you'd use any means to achieve your goal, benefactor.
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
usually only emissaries from the xianzhou yaoqing's sky-faring commission visit him once every century. why do you have to visit him now, of all times?
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up
every wig brings out a different style. it feels like a new challenge every time i try a different do!
great, you've finally gotten your memory back, and i can put down old mettle.
she did -- she saw me on her way over. she told me to go to the repository and read up on anything related to the ambrosial arbor.
the healer does not heal himself. don't try to act tough in front of me.
hey! wait a sec -- uh those intruders, i wanted to ask. what crime have they committed?
do you know anything about what makes you special?
if you ask me, we already have no choice but to confront her about this.
these are the remains of assassins who used cloudhymn magic to conceal their tracks. they aided in the borisin's escape, allowing them unimpeded passage through the shackling prison.
actually, i'm well aware of my own limits. if it weren't for yanqing resisting that heliobus, maybe i wouldn't have been able to hold on until you brought reinforcements.
back in the day, i had to hurry home after work to do my household chores. then in the evening, it was out to the night market with the family to support our stall.
navia can also use firearms, but unfortunately, her style is quite different from that of the characters in the story.
but i still want to try. i'm reluctant to just let zubayr theater go.
clearly, everyone needs to take a step back for now, and reflect on what really matters. when emotions are running high, things get lost in the fray.
my name is yunli.
there were some very valuable images on that film, and we hadn't gotten around to making a backup i must admit, the thieves chose a good target, and they were fast and efficient.
not everyone's like you, chief. even the desert natives who abandoned their homes in the wilderness still wish to have a god of their own.
you've got to have a proper breakfast to get yourself in the right mood for work.
i was initially skeptical about the vidyadhara's betrayal of the alliance but after hearing your confession, i realize that there is no point in talking about trust.
there's no need to covet an illusory sky in dreams, because we have the right and the ability to fly towards a broader horizon.
bye-bye now. come again soon.
but really, i just want those marvels of weaponry to all have masters who treasure them rather than wield them with only brute strength.
fortunately, while the path of the order governs all things, it can't affect the nihility. i came to realize this when the dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
during our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by mister sunday
i suppose it's fair to say, then, that this final show, besides being your farewell to the stage, is also your final gift for her?
i'll take some samples for the alchemists to analyze and figure out where the biological tissue comes from.
but we also don't tend to take many things too seriously. being direct and getting it all out of your system as soon as things come up is better than keeping everything bottled up and never talking about it.
that's right. my lady is feeling better now, so i'm accompanying her for a walk.
report the losses to general jing yuan and find someone from the divination commission. they can't just stand there watching while we deal with this mess
but why would the vidyadhara collude with the borisin and aid in hoolay's escape?
during the irodori festival, the area around the outlander affairs agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
look, it's the invoice for the transaction between second life and fanmu carpenter's. we've brought it back.
i don't think i could repeat what i did a second time.
oh? surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
i returned to the luofu so i could surrender myself to the alliance and atone for my sins.
traveler, miss kamisato, congratulations on winning the exhibition match.
but what about the rest?
just be sure to take care of yourselves out there. we'll meet again at the sabzeruz festival.
this is the only way i can ensure everyone's safety...
don't let your past suffering keep you from the new life that you've worked so hard to find.
it is time for the soul-soothing ceremony. please make your way to earthrise agora in starskiff haven.
hehe let's keep moving towards master lu's warehouse. our goal is to get the invoice, after all.
oh, mister ryuunosuke is making them right now. you can go collect them from my house later.
that's okay. my intention here was to show you some of the repercussions of that great battle.
well, that's not up to me dig in. i called you here so you could enjoy the food.
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
yeah! an actual assistant! c'mon, don't be so distrusting -- do i look like someone people can't rely on?
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
i don't have to fight all of them right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
albedo, is that you? come in.
i know, right? i'll teach them a lesson myself if i catch them in the act, that's for sure.
bronya's a good kid -- you can tell she learned a lot from cocolia. *sigh* it's been a while since we saw each other. i miss her.
don't worry. let me think again.
let's act natural, determine who our tail is, then lure them somewhere more deserted, so we can catch them.
so, you think richard was the one who stole my encryption key?
you guys are acting weird but okay, i'll try.
sorry, i don't mean to sound so formal. once you reach my age, it's difficult to make new friends
i doubt it. the way she went about things often made her seem childish more than anything. i'd say the sword was most likely an heirloom passed down over time.
yeah, from the other books i read, it seems like this goddess really likes to play fast and loose with the details.
hmm. this is indeed an invitation letter issued by the yashiro commission. now that we've confirmed this guest's identity, i have no further questions.
the sights here are nothing like what i've seen at home. there are new wonders to be found with each step.
ah, it looks like the entire delegation from the xianzhou yaoqing has gathered at the alchemy commission. why don't we go see general feixiao and bring her some fruit?
an "ambition" is a yearning for something material, or a concrete outcome. it is finite in nature, and will be replaced by a new ambition in due course.
by neither saying goodbye nor seeing me again, our relationship will remain forever how it was in her mind, at least.
easier said than done do you know how?
it might not necessarily pan out, so don't get your hopes up too much. i'll need to take you two somewhere and ask someone some questions.
you reach toward your waist, but find nothing there. you now recall that your weapons were confiscated before the guards locked you in the cell the bag of treasure along with them.
that might sound silly to you like, why do you have to be happy just because it is?
yeah, miss huohuo has been trying to track down tail -- in addition to helping the squad, that is.
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
understood, thank you sir. then i guess this is bye for now, unless
i know it's hard to believe, but ever since i forged this sword, i've been able to hear the thoughts of all sorts of weapons.
that makes sense. you usually solve problems directly, without the use of any such tricks.
as you approach the tavern, you find a plainly-dressed woman standing nearby. she appears to be rather troubled about something.
my patience is running out. you should know when a mercenary is after something other than money.
once he's recovered, it won't be long until i bring him right back.
pascal, why do your peers keep rejecting you
and thinking about it, bernard only attracted our attention in the first place because he came to look for bonnie.
for this reason, mondstadters call the western wind the "returning wind." the weinlesefest originally began as a celebration to welcome lord barbatos on his return.
in other words, something big must have happened in fyxestroll garden for them to show up.
make sure you deliver the news to the outside world.
ah, um but i'm completely unprepared
show off your flashy moves and make the audience cheer for you!
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
it took enough time to calm her nerves, it's best i don't disturb her again now.
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
stop struggling, hoolay. there's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to the shackling prison.
i see though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
following its celestial trajectory, the great teal star illuminates an endless sea of white across both the sky and land.
as i mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." still, look at it this way: just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
and what do you mean by "take away"? is he planning to leave sumeru?
you're too kind. my brother and i simply go where we must to fulfill our duties.
ah, i see. well, i shall continue walking while you go greet your friend.
hmm... i ended it with a period. it was a statement, not a threat.
enough. both of you. the festive spirit is turning you into giddy little children.
traveler, let's go investigate the place where the fireworks were stolen.
i know this is hard, you don't have to be hard-pressed to make a decision. as i have said... the answer is inconsequential.
you recall all the lessons you've learned in your time and begin to carefully observe the woman's mannerisms.
that's a question for the newcomers. but let's start with that worker over there for now.
in my dream, that was the day i died.
doesn't look like it wants to let us through. do you think if i yell at it i could scare it off?
what!? no! there was a freezing chill, not to mention the way they drifted through the air they were legit ghosts! anyway, the key point was
but let me make it clear: the alliance sent me here to handle the business impartially, not to choose sides.
but my family are only distant relatives aeur" we branched off from the main family line long ago. by my grandpa's generation, the only qimen he knew was a few parlor tricks.
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
you seemed to be getting quite into it. what a shame that you didn't manage to go home with anything.
*cough* i never knew ferrying souls stuck in limbo could bring this much pain
who's legally supposed to take care of this kind of thing? the matra? or the corps of thirty?
as lyney once said a performer's job is to commit fully to their role, and put on a flawless performance for their audience.
okay. but before we move out, at least let me heal everyone with my dandelion breeze.
well then, it would seem that everything is in place. let's go and meet our old friend.
my brother can't hold them back by himself. he wasted a lot of energy on us. he's my responsibility now. besides
the lord of the night should now be able to appear anywhere in natlan. what we need to know is where the ruler of death can be summoned.
a single slash of a blade... isn't really accurate. it was actually two blades, just that the second one was faster.
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
okay, so i guess that means it's time to say goodnight now.
who is this weirdo?
i apologize if this ritual upset you, but i hope you understand i had no other choice.
sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. you two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
i was originally thinking of going with him, but he said he could manage it himself. he told me to go see the sights around fontaine and to enjoy the local culture.
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
accepting others' wishes and turning them into his own wishes aeur" not all heroes are such blank canvases as him, and that is why the world places such great hopes on him.
you know how much you're willing to pay me to be the director? the pay is also an important factor for me to consider, you know!
calm down, i heard you. it'd be rude of me to depart without thanking our benefactors.
so in the vast majority of cases, the one he made tea for was the former electro archon who was also my sister. raiden makoto.
i have other business to attend to now, otherwise i would gladly escort you to the site in person. when you do arrive, please seek out my secretary.
you hear that? in case it was too subtle for you aeur" thoma's complaining that you guys never make time to come and visit your old pals.
does that bother you? i believe we will be able to be frank with each other, but that needs time.
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall
the story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. and the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. approved!
look, we are joined together now.
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express?
the ten-lords commission planned to execute him, but he managed to escape from the shackling prison. he was severely injured -- he forgot nearly everything.
though i occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it aeur" i can't exactly avoid seeing it at the grand narukami shrine, after all aeur" my fate is intimately intertwined with the sacred sakura.
it's ironic to think that in my whole time as a "god," i could only ever dream of receiving this kind of power
that puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins
now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. it does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
(there is definitely more to mister zhongli than meets the eye. i could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
we've made it up till now i could lose an arm and a leg for all i care -- i have to lay eyes on the stellaron.
*sigh* there are many types of friend she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
additionally, the shogun has no need of recreation. there would be no need for her to come here just to pass the time or to relax.
"omni" makes it sound pretty capable, but the corporation released other models onto the market first. know why?
that's just how it is aeur" most of the people in my life will be gone one day, just like a flower.
this isn't a clue, it's just a brand of tea i liketwo cups a day keeps the tiredness at bay.
i had no idea it was your fiftieth anniversary. if i'd known, i would've made some extra-fancy fireworks, just for you.
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
ah i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises
no, i think they might be just overly careless. i seem to have found the location where they've been stashing all their stolen goods. they must have thought it was well-hidden and deemed it unnecessary to post any guards.
i think we've narrowed it down a little further.
king navia is right. we cannot simply stand by and watch as the people of this world suffer.
the akademiya looks down on performers like us. they probably think it would be best if the theater closed down completely.
still, i hope you can avoid danger this time around. an uneventful trip might be a nice change of pace.
and you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
what are you writing miss march?
yes. more precisely, it's right below.
i see. thank you for your valuable insights.
almost certainly from his master aeur" who was also my great-uncle. baizhu's master was my grandpa's younger brother, a former deputy director of wangsheng funeral parlor.
i don't think it's a good idea for you to be this close. if it corrupts you again, it's possible you might take on a new form entirely.
haha. interesting. yes, we have a special relationship, but i don't see anything unusual about it.
she likes having fun and being around people. she can take care of the excitement, and i'll take care of everyone's safety.
very well. then i hereby declare
i figured that as uncle tian's daughter, you'd naturally grasp your father's strategies.
you mean morax? it's been a while since i last saw him. a surprising decision by liyue's archon what a fascinating god he is.
what are you up to, elder caenis?
yes, you're absolutely right. this is what i appreciate about you, you see things the way they are rather than how they appear.
i just got a whiff of it, and it woke me right up. it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission!
they are confined to the water, and yet they live free, swimming around wherever the mood takes them.
to escape with their lives, the villagers would abandon their homes and flee overnight, taking only their most valuable belongings with them. everything else was left behind.
perhaps he plans on doing so, but i won't.
i am herta herself, the emanator of erudition and a true-blue genius. why would i be holding the purse strings? that menial task is beneath me.
"it is believed that takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the souran isshin art, tominaga masanari."
i'm not sure. there don't appear to be any changes however, the many doubts that once plagued me have dissipated.
this is an adeptus relic from liyue, right? it's incredible. i thought you were joking when you asked me to get into this pot.
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek do you get it?
i have a feeling you're going to let her off even more.
but after she said those words: "the time of the adepti has long passed. if even the liyue qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for liyue"
dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
straight to the point, i see. works for me.
no need to feel bad, lady bailu. you were in a dreamworld -- none of it was your fault.
it was against the akademiya's rules to possess books for personal use. if he was going to break that rule, he could have at least copied something useful
yeah now that you mention it, this miner's lamp looks really similar to the star on the previous page
come on. we'll need to get the go-ahead from neuvillette aeur" i know just where to find him.
this jade abacus is too severely damaged. even with my best efforts, i can only restore a small part of the record.
if our opponents were martial arts types, i could hold my own against them but aurum alley's problems aren't something we can fight off with a sword.
which is why we sought you out, to help the astral express save the world together.
everyone really rose to the occasion this time. i won't ever forget what we went through.
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly
if kafka is hiding in stargazer navalia, she'll have left behind traces. let's spread out and look for them -- leave no stone unturned.
garmentmaker, can you give me the intel the nymphs have gathered?
just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the xianzhou artisanship commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to get them to operate according to a certain intention.
i'm sorry for interrupting your conversation with them earlier. but even if you'd been able to hear them out, there's no guarantee you would have gained anything substantial.
really? you're just going to stonewall me!?
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
we've found bennett here, so albedo can't be far away. keep searching this area.
hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face i think it might be my favorite.
well, um, yes but aren't you just repeating the rules?
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
but elder, your actions have gone beyond mere survival you've become a beast driven solely by the propagation, devoid of even a hint of empathy.
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
so we made you a little something. hope you'll like it!
he says my swordsmanship is outstanding, and i think he's a master both in the past and present. so you could say we completely approve of each other now!
i don't know where it went wrong. they possess their own sentience, but are nowhere near geniuses.
but, i can tell you one thing: my favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
i have a gift for you, but i'll need a little time to prepare it i'll contact you once it's ready to collect.
my other senses make up for that fact to some extent -- they're as strong as anyone else's.
so that's what happened, mister svarog. but there's one thing i don't understand why is pascal being treated as a fragmentum creature?
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
miss acheron's words speak sense. regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. and we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
you're like a broken record
i said look at me. take a good hard look. sense anything strange?
the weather and our moods are the same aeur" they can both get gloomy. it's all right, though, because the sky will become even brighter after the rain.
all right, looks like you don't believe me that's fine, i'll ask you again tomorrow!
really? the end result is the same, though. exactly what i do and how i do it are just minor technicalities.
it took some time, but the tenryou commission has assumed full control of this area. with all my heart, i thank the three of you for your assistance. your promised rewards are not forgotten.
the ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, i'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. and, after he left, it became three.
(next up i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
take a look around and you'll see what i mean. this criminal is clearly well-versed both in using music to commit crimes and in making a clean getaway.
i invited you out for some simple fun and games i should have known you'd be like this.
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream and tell mikhail our decision.
so, be a good girl, padisarah, and help out grandpa almond whenever you can, alright?
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
no thanks, mister afshin. you can't use that kind of tactic on her. look, you've already sucked her in.
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
i hear the anglers here sometimes sell their fish to the nearby fishmongers. hmm, let's see what uncle sun has to say.
and this only makes me all the more excited to meet with them.
during the course of finding memories, a picture is worth a thousand words.
alright, then let me ask this. the ideas in zhiyi's manifesto are very similar to your own. is there any particular reason behind this?
oh, it's you. hello.
at least, that's the most reasonable explanation i can think of.
well, if it isn't franz, long time no see! you're still watching the entrance?
you're an archon, but you act so humble. you really don't need to be so polite with us.
some are others are mad i always come out on top. a few decades like that, and people stop knowing how to deal with you.
i don't know, this is the first time i've run into a situation like this i would write to my cousin, but i think we're out of time
the moment i saw the name "sangonomiya" on the list of competitors, i anticipated that she would make it into the finals to face the almighty shogun.
are you sure you're okay just giving it to eric like that?
any organization doing something like that is interested in more than just "mutual aid"
i'll go first to give you a demo.
collei? that's a harsh analogy, where'd all that come from?
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
i saw her leaving the other day with a nervous look on her face, it seemed like she was hiding something in her arms. did you give her something?
alright then. don't worry, it'll all be fine. i'll be right back.
they thought their god would protect them. they had absolute faith that when disaster struck, a divine power would save them from harm.
that's enough when we return, there will be consequences.
why do you insist on becoming a pilot!? i don't understand.
i got arlan to look after peppy because i thought they got along... but was that giving him too much extra pressure?
don't worry about locked doors, benefactors, we can use the conveyor belts.
our aim is to organize a memorable lantern rite. the budget is there just to facilitate planning, we mustn't lose sight of our goal.
my teacher and i have other pressing matters to attend to. please see yourself out.
mhm. there's a special note for the gm at the end of this section that says to proceed to an indoor set for the next part of the script.
whatever other motives they may have, we are at least aligned on this. so let's consider them an anonymous ally.
unfortunately, only one master is here. i'm doing fine.
judging from how active the robot was, its core isn't just scrap metal. it should be repairable.
well then, let's begin your training immediately. it'll be easier to train when we're back in mondstadt, we'll require other people.
anyway, don't dwell on names. as long as the machine works, what does it matter whether it's a "jade abacus" or a "computer"?
so, how about this? i've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
these computers will get up to speed soon. now we're just one final step away from requesting an audience with droidhead.
out of everyone in the world, he is the one who trusts you the most. so much that he drank your fish soup without doubting you, not for one second.
mister svarog, i still want to help you check a few other modules turn around a little.
you look up and see a tavern nearby. it appears to be open for the day.
they are also followers of qlipoth, but what they do is drastically different from us architects. can businessmen honestly support the preservation? i'm seriously doubting their true motives
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
no, i'm not questioning your abilities. it's just that, i've never really seen you use a kamera before.
so tell me, how do you plan to respond to the fontainian musician? it sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war
is it possible that his reputation is fake? is there any way you can check the accounts of the businesses under his name?
you crept in here to steal nous' memories, didn't you?
kouichi just bursts out laughing and says actually, this is one of his carpenter friends. turns out he's a lot younger than he looks aeur" just a few years older than me.
then why did you still come here
besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.
maybe he's just trying to get you two to move faster, or he just wants to provoke you given his nature, this "elite player" might even be him.
uh, probably? but don't sweat it. we've already finished renovating the stage! come on, i'll show you.
alright then. your turn now, my little friend. toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
for mortals, even if they possess the great power of a path, they can't create a flawless world like gods do.
isn't he the true antagonist? the one who sought nothing but his own gain and used the people as pawns to attain it in your heart of hearts, he was the one you truly wanted to defeat.
kouichi! i'm here, how is the boat coming along?
the millelith's casualties are within the range we expected.
let's press on. we can't activate either of these terminals, so let's look for the energy supply installation itself.
this is... a dead end.
but, it doesn't last. with the passing of the seasons, everything withers away. you can try to water it, but it will never bloom again.
not only does she not fit your description, but she voluntarily gave up her gnosis long ago, severing her ties with celestia in the process.
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
perhaps, there's something else we can do?
the value of items housed here can't be measured in money alone but this little piece of stone could fetch a mountain of cash.
yes. i think you'll understand the significance once you see it in short, i need you to help us evaluate our current progress.
that's a shame, but i understand. just let me know if you ever change your mind.
a few days ago, i made my interest in you known to herta. my intention is for you to serve as an "assistant." based on our interactions within the simulated universe, i firmly believe you fit the bill.
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
i found him unapproachable at first, too. but i believe that being able to face him is an important part of my "homecoming."
in that case, would you mind describing it to me?
looks like yinshu isn't here after all where could she be?
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too
my keyboard guy is pretty good, but i still miss our military days playing in the band
you all are great storytellers!
what do you mean? that's me too, y'know. the "me" that my patients see, at least.
it was the most beautiful sky i had ever seen but all i could feel was unbearable pain. i sunk to the ground and gazed up helplessly.
so. what's item one on today's schedule?
take a walk with me. i have things to share with you.
although this appointment breaks with convention, i firmly believe that with your wisdom, courage, and strength, you can lead your team to victory.
well, bladie? are you satisfied?
is something wrong? the sprite is only halfway through the story, but i seem to be detecting some distress and unease.
i know you have many questions do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme
why are you looking at me? want a medal or something? it does kinda sound like a good idea
the past and the future are so similar to each other. i'm indifferent towards them.
do you see that mechanical gear bridge? when you cross over to the other side, you arrive at hell on earth.
this weapon may be young, but he's already very mature. he likes to keep up with the all the latest news.
of course, i still push myself to complete my work when performing my official duties.
the alchemy commission detained me for some time for a health examination. they released me only after ensuring i was in good condition.
in his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. that would be the best place for him to go. so that will also be our final battlefield.
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
we're lucky that no one from the tenryou commission was around, otherwise, we'd all be in big trouble.
while the both of you were roaming the city, someone was paying attention to your every move. unfortunately you have broken your promises.
actually, we're not really unauthorized, are we, judge?
next time you visit, i'll take you to visit watatsumi island's old shrine.
but i disagree. robots have their own thoughts and feelings
huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
ah, the permanence's descendant what a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
hearty combat and exciting adventures not bad, i certainly don't hate it.
let's go. once this stage play concludes it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
utter disregard for human life. why would they want to hide it?
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
don't worry, mister yang.
both victory and defeat are part of the journey.
alright, then this is how i'll show up.
alright, i was only joking, i didn't mean to chastise anyone. there's really no need to take all this so seriously aeur" if anything, i'm gonna feel awkward if we keep this going, hehe.
hello there, everyone. i heard you were working on the piping for the calligraphy tavern. is there anything we can do to help?
but now, i no longer cling to what was lost. i suppose that means our differences have been reconciled.
perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
samuel, nice name. so, what do you need, miss samuel? and what are you willing to give up in return?
these are all charred remains?
mm that is indeed a problem.
the story behind this guitar huh, it'll take a while to tell.
is that it? i thought you were gonna stay for at least a little longer
ah! can you not do that? don't worry, this time we're gonna avenge you! i'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
ah, i heard something about that, too. apparently it's a cart that goes zipping along a "terrifying" course at an "uncontrollable" speed
you are no match for me, and therefore, no match for blade either. let me accompany you -- there is no need to throw your life away.
hoolay, from the very moment you stepped into my mind, you had already lost.
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
but since we're already here, they could use our help.
huh? no no no no, i can't do that
is this the harmony?
she rarely talks about her family. all i know is that she didn't get along with them.
sure, when you're not passed out in fear! hehe
he fooled the silvermane guards into thinking he'd changed but we won't be falling for that act again any time soon!
simply put, there will always be work to do.
you were a great help to folks on the space station -- my job was so much easier with you around.
in my opinion, there are many people around with ulterior motives, making this a very risky business to enter into in the short term.
why, this is the most exciting sub-plot of the novel: the secret investigation. i'm sure you must be curious about where the magical powers of the wisdom orb and floral jelly really come from?
by following the threads of fate, you have begun to write the opening chapter of your story. how do you feel?
this is a medal given to me by the architects see that blue stone in the middle? that's a geomarrow crystal of the highest purity.
okay, but working as a day laborer could be quite dull
if you're not willing to communicate, then the problem just sits there. if you just keep staring at it without doing anything, eventually you'll watch every last opportunity to resolve it slip away before your eyes.
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
let us return. we ought not keep furuyama waiting too long.
you don't want me to have to bark like a dog in front of all those people, do you? besides, i'd really like to help the people in aurum alley.
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
if this theory is correct, little layla's wish may yet come true. once you've gotten to know each other, you'll be able to freely communicate without using the wisdom orb.
if you are in need of mora, you should absolutely consider doing business.
i do, blade is in a prickly situation. on the xianzhou you're the only one i can turn to.
because maybe it doesn't matter so much if something's real or not. maybe magic and awesomeness are what make something worth believing. why should someone else get to take that away from you?
yes, providing the question pertains to something i am knowledgeable about.
the cloud knights have many martial arts traditions. who was it that instructed you in swordplay, young man?
maybe he's on a victory high? or maybe not. either way, it's classic luka.
they set out together, but only one of them made it back minus his sanity.
i can, however, provide some artistic guidance from the vantage point of a highly experienced audience member.
great. and thanks to you for a smooth and pleasant journey, mister wheel.
watch out for monsters. they like to hide. if you need to, clear the area before you dig for the supplies.
i hope so. let's go to fanmu carpenter's. it should be near qingce village.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
and not only do you have belobog music, but music from other planets, too
first, we have lady fu xuan of the divination commission. what do you think best suits her?
i'm not sure, but the heliobi are strange creatures -- even the sharpest sword can't cut them.
the luofu really is a bit conservative. if we encountered a heliobus on the zhuming that was this capable and had no harmful intentions, we would definitely not seal it up.
i'm done making excuses for him. he's not a child anymore. he needs to take responsibility for his actions.
i was planning on making a few trips to bring everything back, before continuing on with my shopping but i don't think i'll have the time.
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so wanna come with us?
since you are already familiar would you mind also showing me the rules sometime?
we'll do it the mercenary way. i'll find leads as we go, all you have to do is just follow me.
don't worry, i said "a" drink. that means just one.
everyone does -- you're the hero who rescued the vidyadhara healer lady in exalting sanctum.
just press the button when you're at your wit's end. and of course, feel free to reach out to me for my "hospice care" too!
oh, good morning, traveler. whenever i see you in the morning, somehow, it makes me feel like today is going to be a good day.
ninja initiate gigaku, what ails you?
when writing up a proof, i only use three words: "obviously," "evidently," and "naturally" aeur" isn't everything self-evident anyway?
human beings don't have powers like us youkai. it's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
the people answered the call of the architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
ooh, i know! you garden folk have a fondness for mirrors, huh how about letting you enjoy some quality time with your favorite object aeur" a mirror?
i've weakened blade's senses to the outside world so that he's only able to hear my voice and feel my touch -- he's oblivious to everything else.
it might be possible to use another heliobus to drive out the one that seized huohuo's mind.
uh-huh, sewing is a fundamental skill for everyone in the theater company because we make all our own costumes. did you know that mister zubayr not only can make costumes, but props too?
as i said, sister, i will handle this.
but how will i do this? a human assuming the role of a god without being exposed
but how can i change her mind? i've tried, but she won't listen. i don't know how to get through to her
qingxu pool has always been home to many secrets. plus, azhdaha once wrought havoc there, so there are even more secrets buried deep underground.
don't worry, i'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
perhaps the reason you do not possess a vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you it's a possibility.
in theory, yes. all you would need to do is survive the rigorous training, and master the swordsmanship techniques required to fight the monsters.
no problem. i will let you try it out as soon as i finish the prototype.
if these items are unclaimed, we may take them without controversy.
in fact, i've already had several troupes approach me for the fontinalia film festival. unfortunately, the scripts were all pretty boring, and didn't pique my interest.
yeah, you're right. it's just a pity that we often only recognize our true feelings after it's already too late.
you are the one who organized the plans for this release party. in other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. so please, show some confidence.
then i'm glad. i shall save you the trouble of hearing what those people may say.
why don't you and mister dan heng tour our "holy city"? see how our people make ends meet in this difficult time. i will have your welcome gifts ready later today.
uh, hey, miss dunyarzad, i wasn't trying to make you cry. i'm not gonna lose my commission because i made my employer cry, am i?
in which case, we don't need to change tactics, just change who we're following.
these stairs they seem to have become more narrow.
the cream of liyue's mercantile crop all see "ascending to the jade chamber" as the greatest honor. each brings rich gifts as they visit, all to curry a little favor with ningguang.
no. you misunderstand. while herta is tied up in meetings, you might find it more convenient to roam the space station.
all in all, i owe everyone a big thank you. it would've been much harder if wildfire had operated alone.
all the painstaking effort that miss sparkle put into it -- how could i ever miss it?
that's right. we received a letter of invitation from miss alice, proposing that we take klee for a vacation in fairyland when work dies down.
thanks to her, i learned how to navigate the forest by the age of six, and could hunt monsters in the wild by myself the year after that.
there are thirty-two versions of my full name circulating among the troops. how do i know? i'm an intelligence officer after all.
i prefer how things are now. i can come and go as i please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
he had long since come to some understanding. i could sense a mix of intricate emotions flowing out.
between us, there have been a few minor incidents. but nothing i haven't already dealt with.
you're here. i've just finished re-inscribing the seal on huohuo's tail. next, it's time to address the matter of cirrus.
still, when it comes to fighting on the front lines, you can put your life in his hands. there's a dozen of us in wildfire who are still in his debt not to mention ordinary underworlders.
well then that's as good as nothing for now so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one
the way up from here leads to a bath that the council granted exclusively to the chrysos heirs. the bath is strictly off limits to anyone other than the heirs.
and then the dream started to twirl and fade away. then, i woke up.
i guess it's time to tell the story of that "mikhail."
(*sigh* true he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
i mean no offense. i simply hope that our adepti forebearers would see liyue in a new light.
lord gnaeus, now that we're at the very heart of castrum kremnos it's time to let you in on our goal here.
take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. i'll have the alchemy commission healers see to you when they arrive.
let's light them up! look! aren't they nice!
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow
since becoming a judge, huohuo has often thought about resigning. she thinks she might not be cut out for the task.
there are three basic principles for happiness at work - do not be proactive, do not say no, and do not be responsible. you should give it a try~
by the way, there's one more thing.
a new card back appeared on the market recently. it's extremely rare, and bears an image of a treasure chest.
even if i had that kind of power, i wouldn't dream of abusing it. i assure you, the dried fruits and pastries i brought are quite ordinary.
you helped a lot with the investigation and arrest anyway, so it's perfectly fair for you to get all the credit. just take it aeur" it works better for me too.
because in the next few centuries, visually impaired people like us will continue to require help from everyone we meet.
mister zubayr said that you're one of us, so that means we will protect you.
even so, let me buy them at market value.
as hunters, you have proficiency in swordsmanship and fighting by default, so there's no need to allocate any additional skill points to those areas.
oh? who permitted you to come onto this stage? now, i understand your admiration for my august self, but i must ask you to keep to the rules.
oh, come on, baizhu. i'm not that unreasonable.
i didn't think many people liked that one seems the city might have a few nice memories of me after i'm gone.
by the way, where is your general? didn't you say he would be joining you?
take all of our fungi and defeat her fair and square. force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
mm an international rock 'n' roll music festival sounded like a good way to attract tourists. and it's to bring attention to the plight of living things, right? seems like a meaningful cause.
that was just to help with the spell shoot, i still hear you
maybe seasoned veterans have an instinct for it.
hmm why don't you show me around and introduce me to the others here?
it woke up to discover that the whole place had been abandoned. so, it decided to collect parts, repair the town, and wait for everyone to return
i am me. there is only one of me, but i can exist in many different forms. it's not important what form i exist in.
you should join us, chevreuse. you missed the first few hours of the party, didn't you?
my advice would be to get on. you're not doing me that big of a favor by staying anyway.
well, i guess i used to be more of a stickler for the rules.
hmm? hmph! aaeur"are you not afraid? might i remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
lisa heard that i wanted to accompany everyone to the islands, so she prepared this pouch. supposedly, opening it will reveal a new way.
i had some spare time, so i decided to come out for a stroll. oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
fate has brought us together -- that makes us friends! i often perform at exalting sanctum, so if you've ever got time, come and enjoy the show!
if you let us in we can do a routine service inspection i've worked on various iterations of this type of installation
ah, you mean the little girl in red? i remember her -- i saw her in the overworld at lady bronya's succession ceremony.
the rules are simple. whoever flies their kite the highest and furthest within the time limit will receive a special honor along with a secret prize.
plus, a long-standing member has recently returned to our ranks after a long absence. i thought it would be fitting to celebrate the occasion.
thank you for your patience, mister alfalfa. let's continue our discussion.
the signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
have we drafted a new patrol map? please give me a copy and i'll look it over when i have time.
there's an old saying in liyue: "a bed that faces the door shall be haunted by a ghost of horror."
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge
but how long can your will remain strong?
perhaps you haven't met me on the battlefield, but i'm certain you've heard my name. now, i'm asking you a question, so answer me! tell me
indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of "death" and shared this truth with all of us.
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
the protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. sounds interesting. approved!
well done. your performance was most impressive.
the dye was modified using a secret technique to harness the power of memories and create mazes like the one we just witnessed.
i've heard there are serious incidents unfolding on the luofu. communication with the divination commission's delve has been severed. for your own safety, i'd suggest you remain here.
don't worry, seele. like i said, it was just the exhaustion. svarog was deliberately holding back.
i was wondering is the train accepting new passengers?
we're going to look for firework materials shortly. while we're out, we'll sort out the boat situation for you, as promised.
from there, we can say that the difference between an abomination and a xianzhou person is not one of taxonomy, but one of culture.
before the ground started shaking, i heard the sound of machinery. i believe there may be an immense mechanical structure under this region of the ocean.
it's a pretty solid story overall. i thought it was just an ordinary adventure at first, but the further we got into it, the more impressed i became with the production and the plot.
there's clearly something special about qiqi. if i'd absorbed that much fetor, i don't think i'd still be around to tell the tale
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
doesn't sound very interesting.
i had to keep all my feelings, all my curiosity about life to myself. no-one could be allowed to know
thank you. i hope the next time i come i won't disturb anyone.
you want to create a situation where all three parties are present?
so how about it? wanna help me out?
the first item is the maritime administration issue. during wartime, we restricted fishing rights for watatsumi vessels in narukami waters
ei seeks eternity. to her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
absolutely. she is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. she's worked several days without a break now.
his childhood, his studies, the thing with his neighbor none of these are recent events. so why are these stories only going around now?
perfect! okay, we need to get to the front line.
oh, that's right, you were possessed by a heliobus once before -- guess it wasn't a pleasant experience, was it?
over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
if it can, then it truly is a blessing bestowed upon us by lord barbatos.
here we are. this is the yae publishing house.
or maybe you'd rather try this? i know, i know aeur" i normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
lastly, there's that craftsman wearing artisanship commission clothing. he's unusually focused on checking that device.
hunting is not a game, it is a battle of life and death. are you ready for your death, abomination!?
hey! did you scumbags even consider that the homayanis might've hired a merc that outclasses you?
and fox envoys are nothing new. stories have been told about them in inazuma since ancient times.
it's a family heirloom, and probably has a history? my ma can swing it with just one hand, but i struggle even with two. ah
man, march seventh -- that's such a beautiful name! i'll make sure to remember it!
don't worry about it, my lady. just some friendly banter between mercs. one punch and those rabid dogs will expose themselves for what they really are.
by no means. you wish to know about the stone, i presume? then let me invite the great seafarer, captain beidou, to tell the story aeur" if she would be so kind.
but then i saw these two random guys in the middle of a pointless argument. it ticked me off, and things went downhill from there
how observant! you're right, i'm not a xianzhou native~
so herta hides her collection with something as simple as this?
okay, so what are we waiting for? let's get moving and see if we can find some witnesses.
you're way too modest! just now, i actually felt really self-conscious when paimon talked about us in the same breath.
a judge of the ten-lords commission has no past. once one has entered the service of the commission, all links with the outside world are severed
only a few simple songs.
ah, then perhaps we should thank the stars that we were able to wrap both of your parts so quickly today. switching around the filming schedule would have been a real pain.
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
this is the ninja mantra. embellishing words with ninja enchantments is bound to make the play a hundred times more vivid.
yep, touch it and find out -- ice cold. i was just about to fix it up.
"against the scorching sun, a beautiful flower will never endure. within my fair embrace, my love for you is tender and pure."
check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.
i see. no wonder those assistananas only want to teach students one on one
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee)
i seldom had the time to drink tea. any free time i had was spent practicing martial arts.
i'll definitely come by more often
herta have you ever met her? i'm curious about the tastes of someone who used their own name for a space station.
actually, i want to talk to you about our little lynx.
that drink has a fair amount of memoria in it, intended to make dreams more vivid and pleasant, but instead it caused your anxiety to be amplified, eventually triggering serious hallucinations.
you say these things in the hope that we will understand and accept them. but if you don't even know that your self-sacrifice is going to pay off, all you're doing is hurting morale.
the moment news spreads about penacony going public, trillions of customers will immediately receive a message like this:
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
what did you tell her?
even though my apprentice has learned a thing or two, as a master, i can't stop worrying!
this is an aranara carving i bought in port ormos. i heard it's very popular with kids, so here, have one.
so aggressive. are all the robots in the settlement like this?
i'm afraid that wouldn't be very convenient for me. it'd be better if you two went alone.
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
but yes, you can count on us! we wouldn't let you miss out on all the fun.
well, if nothing else, all this proves that the doctor really did have some urgent matter to attend to, and left sumeru in a hurry.
i have already completed five sets of bow exercises. if you are up to it, i would not mind accompanying you for another five.
anyway, the script calls for a team of four. ah, yes. we're missing one final player right now.
now that you mention it yes. we're being watched.
look who we have here? a lovely young lady.
is everything in order? if so, we need to meet up with lords phainon and mydei.
alright, i'll leave you to fine-tune your musical while i go and procure a stage.
looks like things blew up real quick everyone's flocked here to see what's going on.
is that so well, i respect your choice.
he chose that specific liquor from xinyue kiosk because the fiery flavor would mask the bitterness of the poison, and he chose to wait until the fatui official was drunk and had his guard down before delivering it to him.
it's the exact location of the scene, as well as the formal permission to use the venue. seems like they have everything prepared.
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around
oh, right! so there's a line going there too?
maintaining an orderly residence incentivizes us to adhere also to the rules that give order to our lives.
please, don't fight. i know everyone wants the tavern to reopen as soon as possible so that the forest can return to normal.
may happy times always be with you.
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
you mentioned earlier that the troupe was like your "home"
the one closest to death often knows the most about how precious life is. her embrace brings eternal sleep, but such farewells are always warm.
see, i told you it wasn't going to be that simple. where is this?
if she doesn't want to reveal the commission's secrets, then you have no choice but to wait.
we heard about miss firefly from black swan but we never expected miss robin to
this is a memory fortune pouch i prepared for the express crew. my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
is that a secret code or something?
you know, the earliest shrine on watatsumi island was not located in sangonomiya.
i believe that as time goes by, this firework will only grow brighter and more beautiful in your heart.
we will meet again, friend. no matter where your journey leads, the gates of okhema will forever be open to heroes.
you don't seem to have much going on right now, though, so i think i'll go ahead and snooze a while longer.
my name is tingyun, the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. please look after me from now on, benefactor.
i understand. please help reassure the people in the village and tell them everything's going to be fine with the millelith standing guard.
the resurrection of king deshret? first i've heard of it
anyway vengeance will be mine.
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
all i know is that despite being custom-made, they are not particularly exquisite aeur" if they were, you can be sure i would have purchased one sooner.
the man appears somewhat disgruntled at having been exposed, but soon relents and raises his leg for you to take a better look.
bring it on. i'm ready for your challenge.
it's a shame that i forgot to ask her for her name. i only know that she's from the garden of recollection.
forget it, it's all in the past now. i shouldn't get myself down, i must look ahead to my new life.
ridiculous! hoping to stop me with such cheap parlor tricks? not a chance!
recover those cherished recollections and enshrine them in a land of purity. in doing so, all will be preserved from true oblivion.
losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
i know you said it's perfectly safe here, but to go to bed without someone on lookout i don't think i'm used to that yet.
i tested it so many times just to make sure and now that i finally boarded the express, it doesn't even work. oh well, luckily, i brought along some sparklers too!
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
hmph, you're about to come face to face with reality.
that will depend on our assessment of our own abilities.
don't worry. we weren't discussing anything confidential.
the situation is ever-changing in a card game. to emerge victorious, you have to be willing to take some risks.
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it they don't teach this stuff in school. wait did i even go to school?
i'm here for the watchmaker's legacy... and that's it. i think i've been honest enough.
please come this way.
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
hi there. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
sorry, please keep still for a moment
oh, that's right! mister zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
yeah? you could've gotten me to open it for you!
oh, i wanted to ask you -- that bronya girl is she really a silvermane guard?
on any other day, that'd probably be a good idea. unfortunately, it's not gonna work today.
i was only joking, hook. junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. but you must make one promise to me
i will hold them back. don't let hoolay escape!
also, i've seen you instructing ayaka. that cold and dignified personality is exactly what we need for the older musketeer.
yeah, creating dramatic value. isn't that what you're most obsessed with?
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because
my decision to destroy the jade chamber was nowhere near as thought-through as i made it out to be. i just thought we should do what needed to be done, and this was a decision that only i could make.
if this is fate, then let's grab it in our hands and turn it around.
huh, mister assistant detective? you seem to be getting anxious?
hmm i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
when your heart is set on something, you get closer to your goal with each passing day.
bronya, do you really
after we arrived on the xianzhou, the mara in him flared up so violently that even my spirit whisper couldn't suppress it. he's not fit for interstellar travel in this state.
i'm sure you'll have a great time. don't forget to send my regards to the supreme guardian while you're there.
oh, what's the difference between the two?
so, you mean the ones who scoured the settlement for me were also from the spina
the garden of recollection has eyes everywhere. if he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the memokeepers -- i've warned him about that.
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
i've been wondering which came first: the audience or the performance?
hmm. even the pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, not to mention the rear wheelset bearing. this looks like the work of svarog's minions.
(that look in his eyes it's like he became an entirely different person as soon as i defeated him.)
technically, amber and i are on a "vacation schedule."
but now that i look closer, it seems like the lanterns are floating in midair. how is that possible?
just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
rex lapis' death is indeed an extraordinary circumstance. but to think that they would call for a council of adepti rather than come down here directly
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
the guard over there said that i needed an "encryption key" to open the gate. can you help me out?
it's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. it was once quite popular during festivals.
no, i recognize my family's handwriting. we are all doctors after all.
hehe, don't worry. i'm always happy to help a junior colleague from yuehai pavilion.
they seemed happy. if i had to take a guess, i would say they finally found the kind of life they always wished for.
it's not so bad at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
also, we'd be able to gain control of theofan, yusupov's second-in-command. then we'd have a pawn in the ranks of the fatui.
who did you hear this from? do you remember what they looked like?
so you should also mind my warning, meng. if you won't let go of the past, i might reunite you two sooner than you think.
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
correct. you don't even feel a lock hole on the cell door.
and that's the only cocolia you guys ever got to know, huh always ahead of everyone else, never looking back, even for a second
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
very well. now, please close your eyes...
i mean, this is my first time inside a teapot. i doubt anyone would believe me if i told them.
until i grew up, and learned the true face of deshret's relics for myself.
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
to put it bluntly, it was constant torture with no end in sight.
ahem. oaeur"noaeur"deaeur"ra?
fine, you do you. all we need to do to convict you is establish that the poison in his system is the same as in uncle tian's.
i think we need a little private time. see you soon.
i misjudged the situation and offended you. my apologies.
this feast is held in honor of each and every one of you gathered here today. i hope all of you get to relax and enjoy our hard-won victory.
do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? or was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
that's settled then! there's no time to lose -- we should head out as soon as you're ready.
every time i heard that her experiments failed, i'd rush over asap and congratulate her with utmost sincerity aeur" there's nothing more precious than failures for a genius.
i've finished extracting that chip from the small robot. now all that's left to do is move all of this circuitry into the new shell
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again
huh... there's something strange about that sofa.
and because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
not quite. i only want to ask, how exactly did she become a galaxy ranger?
as memories are carried in the city breeze, the faults of such grievances are passed on from one generation to the next. it is now my turn to bear this burden.
still, if i back away from this and something happens to ororon, i would never forgive myself.
of course that wouldn't work. neither do i have any intentions of pushing ninja initiates to adopt the way of the dazzling ninja.
i didn't know gangs could have auxiliary members
presumably miss sparkle is now carefully arranging the next crime scene, right?
my name is bronya rand, heir to belobog's supreme guardian and acting commander of the silvermane apologies, i'm used to introducing myself like that -- you can call me bronya.
do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the sacred sakura's roots?
please don't worry, mister dan heng. if someone must be held accountable, it won't fall solely on your shoulders.
i seem to hear a note of pity in that question. perhaps you find us to be weak and defenseless.
if all he wants to do is steer clear of me, then maybe he shouldn't have brought me into this world in the first place.
we talked about a lot of things -- how she repaired the express, all about her adventures, a certain resident fluffy conductor, and you guys
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
such is life, full of surprises. that's why you gotta seize any opportunity to take a break -- who knows when trouble will come knocking at your door.
he informs you of the locations of the monsters with a disdainful tone, as if he's certain you have no chance of making it out alive.
be very careful and watch your step as you make your way through.
imbibitor lunae, if memories are returning to you, share them.
unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. with his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
sounds good to me! i support your decision.
also, my cousin wrote back to me. she mentioned that people have started to get sick in yilong wharf as well.
as for me, i'm gonna check the area for any unusual activity.
y'know, i never guessed you'd become a pro at this job -- i only wanted you to experience the fun of working here
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
it seems like the previous owner was stuck here forever, too.
well, now that everyone's more or less finished creating their characters, we can begin.
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
it seems we've had a little tagalong all this while
stand aside, rookie. let me show you how we zhuming swordmasters treat their apprentices.
so, this is where you heard the lord of the night? guess that means she really has awakened
let the soldiers recuperate. but don't let your guard down aeur" if she returns with a vengeance, we must be prepared.
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
don't worry, paimon. i've already thought of a variety of stratagems for the match.
speaking of traveler, what do you think of the resistance army's chances?
hehe, there's no one else here, pela -- no need for such formality.
does your greed matter more to you than your fear? more to the point, if you can play a tune from memory, don't you think you should be capable of making an honest living?
hmm? go ahead. i'll tell you everything i know~
the president commands the trust of many reputable shops in the alley. their support for him was likely to be a big obstacle to your rejuvenation project.
in that case, let's play a match of genius invokation before you depart from narukami island.
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
why does life slumber...? we don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream.
i take my job seriously! i'd never post something like "late as usual" on a public forum.
i've been thinking about making a brand-new mask based on some trait. you know, switch it up a little. any recommendations?
let's focus on the current situation right now. please help me!
cirrus, we've come to ask you a few questions. i hope you'll be cooperative.
remember, this is a war of words over to you.
what? now that you have the real robin, i'm useless? oh, how disheartening! i've done so much for the family.
forget it. if you see her, let her know this: as demigods, we can't avoid our duties forever.
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
tch another sandstorm? what's up with these recently?
it's a relief to see you safe and sound, miss robin.
if we want to get our evidence, we're going to need some help. now come with me. we must awaken the professional.
there's no need to take such great pains. if you just want confirmation i've already told you the answer, miss sparkle.
march, there is no such thing as completely ready.
you aren't getting any funny ideas, are you?
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
but it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the inazuma of today is no longer inazuma.
i don't know where hat guy went we just saw layla not too long ago, though.
not at all. you don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. all you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
that's certainly part of it. but every bidder will have noticed that none of these items have a particularly high going rate on the market in and of themselves.
i agree. he'll decline any question he can't answer anyway, so you might as well give all of them a shot.
nothing serious, really. we've just received a lot of reports in the past few days over things like line-cutting, reselling goods at inflated prices
that must be the first step in their mind control process. you were lucky.
whatever your choice is, i will accept it.
yes! the mighty blessing of the reignbow arbiter annihilated all abominations in a single strike! but we had to pay with the blood of hundreds of thousands of soldiers just to halt their advance!
this is amphoreus' flame-chase journey aeur" "a band of heroes dedicated to slaying the gods and reclaiming the twelve coreflames for the world to start over anew."
my informants often provide me with extremely important information. it's only fair that i endeavor to meet any requests they have in return.
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
the child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some fried tofu.
yes, we do. still, the artisanship commission is filled with security mechanisms. even the general won't be able to save us in time if we get trapped.
well, in light of your impending departure, shall we take a photo together?
i don't often feel tired. seeing the mora come in has a way of making me feel quite invigorated.
grandpa! give me that cursed sword right now! i'll melt away the remnants of that man's curse once and for all!
even if it's not fireworks-related, i'll happily oblige. customers come first, always.
everything we've seen here indicates that there was once a human presence in these waters. still, there isn't enough for us to infer what kind of civilization it was.
i almost lost my cool when he went for his flask
because i wanted to change myself.
if i can pass on everything i have learned, i can create a legacy that will live on long after i am gone.
no, we're still not quite there.
considering the gravity of our endeavor, we can't allow a little thief to spoil the show.
i will not forget this. i shall be sure to repay your kindness at an appropriate juncture.
you are unduly concerned. i'm simply conserving my energy.
this upcoming scene is the two musketeers' final confrontation with the baron. there'll be quite a bit of action, but no choreography beyond what we've already rehearsed.
it'll be my turn to make breakfast tomorrow. you'll be able to sleep in.
to make this tea party even more lively, i've invited someone else to join us today
i grew them myself, and i've already picked out some good ones.
and some tea-flavored hard candies. they're for sigewinne.
congratulations, kaveh! also, you'll need to prepare for the award ceremony
i'm not accustomed to expressing myself, but i consider myself a good listener. if you have any troubles, come find me. i'll guard your secrets.
in your opinion, what does this "deja vu" mean?
if he can conquer his fear and return as a demigod, we will be one step closer to the miracle that the prophecy promised.
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
candace will be okay on her own. i trust her, so you can too.
much as i expected. the insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists you seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
so, you're not a participant? you look like you know your way around a fight.
as inazuma's god, it is high time i honored their wishes.
however, if you were to use "dear friend" to address an intimate friend, the recipient would think that you were deliberately trying to estrange them.
don't be scared, durin. we'll be right by your side.
i'm trying to find my own room too, and i heard a commotion here... so i came to take a look. luckily your door was open, or it could've gotten dangerous. that man looked like he was up to no good.
ooh, she marched off quickly. so cold.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. i've been warned that the ones in the mine won't go down without a fight.
shh, that's a brave thing to say out in the open if the cloud knights hear you, they won't think twice.
our people? or someone from the ipc?
well let's see. ah, yes -- a silvermane guard standard issue portable heater. i--it's broken, though.
first things first. follow me to the entrance.
yaoyao, thank you for bringing my herbs. i will make sure to take them.
speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current inazuma?
haha, don't drink too much, or you won't be able to sleep tonight.
i helped set the underlying mechanisms for this type of gear bridge. it's controlled via different terminals in combination. let's go find them.
after some time, a rich aroma begins to fill the air. even a passing cat can't help but stop in its tracks and look up in anticipation.
oh, really? but i just heard pom-pom say that she sometimes sleeps in until noon.
if she was there too then i understand. she wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? clara's always been a kind-hearted girl
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
we investigated so quickly that perhaps we've missed a thing or two along the way. let me activate deduction mode and consider things again from the top to see if we can find anything new.
it's really easy -- see this chandelier? next we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
a bunch of them have bad endings, though. like, oh aeur" the fire diamond will get put in a rich person's gallery, where it will never be ignited again.
aha! well, at least one of you gets it!
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
the guest rooms are charmingly minimalist
the purchase price of sky-amber doubled to support the lord of preservation. however, it is up to the corporation's fancy whether this becomes good or bad fortune for worlds rich in ores
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
but last time we met, he mentioned he had something to do in aaru village. you can try your luck there.
workshop? oh, do you mean the tempering workshop in rivet town?
i can't imagine it how will i feel when i have to face pascal after being forgotten so many times?
on the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. but aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
i serve ningguang, the tianquan of the qixing. the scope of my work includes some of liyue's biggest secrets.
some vagrants also make modifications to their pets, which they call pet upgrades.
besides, i'm sure i could master dishes like "la lettre a focalors" or "blubber profiteroles" in no time. if i felt so inclined.
it's not like that. you're making this too complicated
i just scouted out all of wolvendom but i did not see you.
by the way, what did you do to that man earlier? it was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.
as i've said, talk to asta! she's the lead researcher. she's in charge. go, go, go.
haha, i said i was going to resign from being her bodyguard, not that our friendship was over. we're still the best of friends.
if you don't believe me, try it for yourself: soon we will face another battle. can you change that possibility?
the sky-faring commission went toe to toe twelve times against the plagues author in the past. three times we were nearly wiped out, but each time we rose up from the ashes and rebuilt.
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
what i mean is that you don't require medication. just stroll around the luofu more and take in the barrage of new sights and sounds. stop drinking sweet dreams soda and your symptoms will disappear in a few days.
careful, there are some strange things on the wall and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe
it looks like we're all here. well then, time for me to announce the results of the assessment process.
otherwise, how could one hope to capture even one thousandth of the almighty shogun's majesty?
but someone didn't agree with that assessment, and it just so happens i was able to fulfill his request.
her opponent is skilled in the art of deception. even if she appears to have worry written all over her face, don't fall for it. she's likely trying to lead you into her trap.
oh, by the way aeur" since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
that's settled then. i'll leave nat to you. remember to keep the secret -- for bron-- no, for belobog's sake.
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
so, i've always been curious about your sword -- how the weight is distributed, what material it's made of, whether it contains any special ingenia, and what kind of sword techniques you use
on the other hand, the entire crew of the astral express seems to be extraordinarily skilled.
and what would a festival be without me? i'll be sure to go have a look, too.
i've considered that possibility, but even still, i want to tell her what we've found. i think i owe her that much true friendship is built on trust.
this trial was prepared by cloud retainer. its goal is to help me feel like an adeptus again.
not to mention, forty-five system hours ago a stellaron burst occurred on the luofu.
but first, we should head to jueyun karst. if you'll excuse us, madame ping, we'll be leaving now.
you collect the treasure and make your way back to the capital with your bag of loot in hand.
anyway, i should get back to work here's hoping you keep on winning.
curious? about the heater? it's just a standard geomarrow radiator -- you can find them anywhere in the administrative district.
that's enough knowing the enemy for now. come on, i want to see what the ring looks like.
i've heard many good things about you, master xingqiu. thank you for your assistance.
fireworks are more visible at night if possible, i suggest you wait till after dark to put your plan into action.
hmm? what's wrong? just adjust the focal length a bit.
um, i mean, who is this knight?
i suspect the reason they're dragging their feet is that they have their doubts about whether the show will really go ahead, considering all the issues you've been facing.
that thought has brought me great comfort, and now i know how to speak to you properly.
stay out of this. you don't understand the situation.
foolish question. there are only two kinds of things aeur" those that must be done and those that must not.
so i will ask you once more have you made up your mind, phainon of aedes elysiae?
i'm always trying to convince mister svarog. please give me more time
here, take it -- the corridor of fading echoes mastery mark -- you've earned it!
you have to try this fish. it's found exclusively in the waters around seirai island. they shipped it to inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until i ordered it.
kremnos seems to be hosting a festival, where its victor can go on to have an audience with the ruler and be bestowed with honor. it's just as mister damionis described.
how can that be? my ship was the last one into port before the jade gate was shut. the sky-faring commission has already locked down starskiff haven entirely
i was gauging his reactions just now, did you see? unless we have irrefutable evidence, he won't question cocolia's orders. if you go after him now, our plan's as good as over.
the bandits were eventually brought to justice. but the fear and trauma remained in the villagers' hearts.
good morning. xavier said yesterday afternoon went well?
yes, everyone attending the auction today is in possession of lost property belonging to me.
don't let her words distract you.
so, let me introduce myself. i'm the intelligence officer for the silvermane guards, and a temporary guide for the "a journey through belobog's history" program. my name is pelageya sergeyevna.
well, it appears that you are still unable to give explanations for several details about how the nameless got involved in the ambrosial arbor crisis.
though, snezhnaya's fatui are known to be the most aggressive diplomats in teyvat
why would someone from such a wealthy family do something like this for money it's unbelievable! we have to find a way to stop this before they sell the film!
younger people have bundles of energy, and older people have a wealth of wisdom. each have their strengths.
general jing yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, i'll take care of it for you. you need the final word from the ten-lords commission to quell any doubts.
i didn't see anything wrong with her ways at the time, and, anyway, children don't get to choose how they're raised oh, she did bring me back a pet from liyue once. it was a geovishap hatchling.
it's amazing how many songs are stored in its library. someone must have paid big money to get all the copyright issues sorted.
i just finished a commission in the desert for a usual client of mine. nothing too interesting just escorting a shipment of goods. i'm on my way to report back.
however, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.
now, i can embark once more on my journey as a "traveler of no return," exploring the paths that lie beyond.
every year, when the fireworks go off, i say to myself, "another year has already passed."
clean up after yourself. can't you just wipe it off with your hands?
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
oh, i guess miss sparkle has written herself into the skit here, and this has nothing to do with the actual case. goldhammer -- is that her real surname?
if alhaitham and cyno's sources are solid, then we can be sure that tighnari still has the akademiya's trust.
he asks this question aeur" "would natlan have been saved if the ceremony succeeded?"
i'm just following the doctor's advice. miss bailu said i could take a stroll, so here i am.
the outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. the children of belobog have made their decision. they have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.
i'd be partial to some shortbread.
miss tingyun, what's this about?
mumbling?! i'm praying!
ahh, at long last we can finally be at ease now that we've nipped those problems in the bud.
but misha can see clockie, too, right? they even grew up together, but misha hasn't started the way of the trailblaze yet
fine, let's finish up here. but i'm gonna put it out there -- we're not gonna forget those lines of yours anytime soon
when you heard that did it make you think that maybe i really was a cynical profit-chaser after all?
you weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you?
but, um where are moon carver and mountain shaper?
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
luka should tell her to go back to town -- he's always worrying after the kids' safety.
but from now on, i want to spend my time learning real stories about real people, and how they touch the lives of others around them.
luka do you often find stuff for other people?
practices? come on, you make it sound like the "long-standing practices" in this alchemy commission are something great.
she told me that the most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
the next battle round begins now.
now that i know the truth there is a certain sweetness to the scenery all around us.
mister svarog, it's such a massive vein. i've never seen so much geomarrow before
claw was only this big when we first met. he was huitzilin's saurian companion back then. she kept dragging him to my place, so, over time, we got to know each other.
at the end of each puzzle, you're rewarded with
if it were really that profitable, those in the know would have kept it as quiet as possible. you have to wonder, if the news is spreading like wildfire, who's fanning the flames?
hmph! didn't think you'd accuse me of goofing off never mind the gift i got for you then
but i still feel like it'll be an uphill battle. i need to be calmer, cooler, and more collected.
miss black swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?
"that ningguang," they thought "she must be up to something. we can't let her get away with it"
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me"
rosaria told me that the abyss order is going after boreas.
it would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
sorry, did you have something you wanted to say to me?
i'm wondering though, are there any restrictions against, uh "aliens" like me from boarding the train?
let's leave it there, shall we? work hard, now, hehe
hmm probably a scene from ancient inazuma.
come on, camping is about teamwork! let me have a try.
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
and take it from me: if you two really do decide to visit port ormos, you'd best watch your backs. let's just say that the eremites there aren't nearly as friendly as those here in sumeru city.
i have laid my heart bare, and in return, i just want you to make a single promise.
i will be eagerly awaiting your visit. it would be wonderful if you could visit my home and enjoy a taste of our tea and desserts.
after all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
it is my pleasure to announce that the winner of the masterful chefs finals is:
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is
they won the archon war together, and when baal established the shogunate, beelzebul became her kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." in other words, she acted as baal's body double.
if i said "best for the universe," would you believe me? hehe best for me, naturally.
so, ningguang organized a private meeting with miss charlotte to ask for her help in fostering cooperation with the right people.
because you were created for that purpose -- your body has been transformed by the power of an aeon. you are immune to stellaron contamination.
ding-a-ling -- i won~
ha! i knew you'd say that. here, i've got a gift for you
i read that a stellaron's internal fluctuations will cause a fragmentum to appear.
perhaps it's the first time you're hearing that title to put it simply, i'm the person currently in charge on watatsumi island, which is also the home front of the resistance.
as for you, you must be the guests from the astral express, right? saving the luofu from that crisis, it's so impressive.
hmm what kind of dessert should i try next?
by the way, there's really no point in trying to hide the way you feel.
everyone rose to their responsibilities. and i finally regained my freedom
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
imbibitor lunae do you still remember the battle against shuhu?
mister svarog, i want to help pascal overcome those negative emotions. i want to take on this responsibility.
uh hah, good question! so, actually, we're affiliated with the ten--
now that you've decided, i don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. i think you're making the right choice, bronya.
mm, i don't blame you for that. a disregard for human life doesn't exactly endear you to other humans
yeah. they've always been against us. it wouldn't surprise me if they're using the akasha to intentionally repeat the sabzeruz festival as a sick joke.
just as i thought. they didn't go to liyue harbor aeur" they went that way.
let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme she was completely lost in the memory zone.
hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
it makes sense that there are many merchants who oppose the merchant guild and support the ipc.
she hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
but in her own life, her greatest desire wasn't to be the center of attention i can tell how much she loved you all, and how much she loved the troupe.
just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
why do you think i've come here? we've found a way to dispel the eternal freeze, to seal the fragmentum. it might be the only lifeline this world has left!
in my opinion, there is no murderer for this case.
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
you don't need to worry about me. oleg guaranteed that i wouldn't be harmed. he seemed like a man of his word. go and rest.
oh, i just love the atmosphere. it feels like one big, happy family.
by the way, if i hadn't caught it and helped it hit its mark, that borisin prisoner would have gotten away.
mavuika knows about all this, doesn't she?
i've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. so i know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end.
clervie's words probably gave them the excuse they were looking for. whether they actually believe them to be true is secondary.
the world remains constant over the centuries. but human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. transitory.
whenever you're free, let me know and i'll do a performance for you.
yes, i feel a lot better. the more i think back on everything, the more surreal it all feels.
ugh, that noise! do fragmentum monsters usually sound like this?
lingsha, as always, you're still an expert in making unpaid work sound so noble and grand
you're just in time -- everyone is asking this ipc goon for an explanation!
my tears wouldn't stop, and i couldn't see anything. i kept gasping for air until i collapsed in a pool of blood
perhaps you'll be the first guest to meet the dreammaster in years, mister yang.
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
mm, true, but i'd probably only do a few decades, hehe.
fiendling pest! what tricks did you pull on ninja initiate merchant?
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
i think i already see you two as people of the grand bazaar. yep, without a doubt.
i get it -- you're scared. i'm scared too. i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
how interesting. for a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.
if you're bored, you could go and find the messenger from the divination commission.
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
mister assistant detective, please feel free to point out a suspect as the murderer.
hehe regardless, please do look after me while i'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
please continue with this mentality, lord phainon. i believe you'll be alright.
still, we hung out every day, it's only natural that my love for inventing would rub off on her.
but i sincerely advise that you cease this behavior immediately. it is liable to affect the fine you'll need to pay in the end.
"be it but three moons from the start, he who returns is not he that departs."
so, we'll find tighnari, and convince him to get us the latest intel on the doctor. then, depending on what we learn, we'll make any necessary adjustments to our plan.
and yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
in the end, only seven victors remained standing in teyvat. they built cities and nations on the corpses of the vanquished, and thus began the era of the seven.
whew, i'm getting sleepy myself. see you tomorrow. remember to wake me up on time
of course not! what were you thinking?
i've read "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." it has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
you are a woman of method and integrity, i see.
people of belobog -- hear me!
someone had once questioned my research and said it was not science. well, i replied: "who said this is science? have you ever seen magic?"
since no one's around to entertain us, let's make ourselves at home. stay close to me so that my "white" can cover you, too.
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details
alright. goodbye then, urakusai.
something i've begun to realize since my departure from the opera epiclese is that there's a lot you don't see when you observe everything from on high.
i'm sorry, brother. i always make you worry when things get serious.
the pharmacology of this draught of draconic surge is peculiar. i'll need time to run a thorough analysis. when i have a conclusive answer, i'll contact you immediately.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure
in some ways, i believe he is similar to mister svarog. i can't overlook this unique quality
do you now realize how dire the consequences of wild speculation can be?
i can still hardly believe it. i'll use my own methods to locate tingyun's whereabouts, but at present i
this is the best reason you could come up with? you think tacking on the word "family" will be enough to talk me into helping you?
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
but i don't feel that making it easier to learn is necessarily a good thing.
good example. do you know how to do the drunken swordplay?
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching
treasure one way to draw your target out of hiding.
i'm sure jarilo-vi won't be the only planet to have ipc visitors, but i bet not all of them will have a visitor like topaz
i'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the skysplitter.
now i've got one of my items back, let me show you what makes it so special.
i know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times it's making me a little nervous.
so that's what you think of me? yet another transgression to avenge
it's my duty to stop intruders from breaking into important places. if telling the truth sounds rude, then i'm afraid you're just a little too fragile.
hmm. maybe the fatui want to cover up some secret of the balladeer? is that why they tried to seize haypasia?
it appears so. i'm not sure what he's trying to say though.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
actually, i didn't need any answers -- he made them all up himself.
when the flatbed trolley passed, he opened the box and got into an altercation with halsey, which caused the loud thud.
and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
is that so very well. then please speak, witness of teyvat, my accuser and fated opponent.
most people in a frenzy don't stop to ponder the details.
she folded the pages of books into small origami animals, gave them life with her magic, and with time, that's how the forest of blessings took shape.
thank you, everyone, for your patience. i am pleased to announce that this year's weinlesefest has officially begun.
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
huh? really? i just wanted to say something
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the xianzhou zhuming!
i understand.
for chatting with you let's go with tracking techniques, ambush essentials, expanding your network of contacts, and setting up lookouts.
i'm sorry. i wasn't there for the whole thing. by the time i arrived, the worst of the fighting was already over.
if nothing else, we can safely say that we accomplished what we set out to do.
think pom-pom will like it?
this is forbidden territory which can never be ventured into.
no, i can't but more importantly, what kind of "foul language" were you using?
uh, sorry all cloud knights answer to the ten-lords commission. duty calls
it's all about the bartender's pride. it wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. that's the mindset i use when i brew my coffee.
if you thought childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence
i'm somewhat of a picky eater, sorry you went to all this trouble
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
compared to the skies and the stars, our lives are as brief as fleeting insects how i wish i can witness the day that the xianzhou truly returns in triumph.
but seriously though, i always wondered if you had some personal motives behind it.
good morning? you mean you only just got out of bed? this is already quite late by my standards. i typically rise well before daybreak.
woah, woah, woah. it's not like that, paimon!
i think i understand.
good. in that case, let's first pay madame ping a visit in the city before heading out to jueyun karst.
shangshang is my best friend. aside from my street-performing brothers, she's the person i've known the longest on the luofu. i wanted to become sworn sisters with her, but she didn't seem interested.
but that can wait judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
after the duel between mister callas and myself.
at least we know who to look for next. we can ask the bloodhound family for information.
i sent multiple letters, all met with silence. you know her, himeko, the space station is but a mere warehouse for followers and rare items. she doesn't really care about it.
i am not without my doubts about the whole affair but watatsumi island is hardly affluent, and these supplies are a much-needed lifeline for us.
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
take this one for example: "the good thing about being reincarnated as a hilichurl is that i only need to eat sunsettias to become stronger"
they must have fallen down here with us. pretty lucky if you ask me.
you promised me, qingni! we shall discuss this when we return.
that's how things were until the day we fell out. a lot of our shared possessions never left her office again
but he is very proud and incredibly stubborn. he doesn't care much about other people's feelings.
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you
you should go back soon, lady bailu. those two medics have had a rough day.
you don't think twice before reaching for your sword, do you? ugh do you have any idea how long i've been tracking these targets?
i think they're more popular with the older crowd -- i bet gunn would know how to use them. still, if i remember correctly, gunn only listens to audio tapes...
it feels surreal that everything worked out for the alley.
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
"believe in the furina you see on stage. she is the one you can trust."
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
hey, are you sure? maybe a couple of punches will help to jog your memory?
what can i say? i don't trust it either. for some reason, whenever someone tells me they're gonna do something interesting, i end up imagining a pile of trash
the skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than i imagined now that i'm on board.
i also felt that the space was targeting us, but yanfei managed to exploit its weakness. leave it to yanfei to find a loophole.
with what power belobog currently holds, we are far from being able to assist the nameless however, i do hope that one day we can provide you with reliable support.
but one thing is for certain this little fella is not under remote control. he's operating entirely of his own accord
the delusions they're still on your mind, aren't they?
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within the stellaron.
you've never ever seen a flying sword before?
miss topaz, i know you've done a lot of research into belobog. i was wondering if there was any information on the engine of creation in your records?
so the legends say, but who knows if it's true.
has your time in okhema been enjoyable? if you have any wishes, please let this "garmentmaker" know. the holy city will certainly offer the most splendid hospitality for its allies.
that's just a bunch of drunk talk. engur and delavar like to talk themselves up when they're drinking. "engur the wide-eyed butcher" and "delavar the scar-riddled bandit" are the nicknames they came up with for themselves.
miss march, you might have the wrong idea. i'm just feeling a mix of regret and relief.
we've still got work to do. let's keep going.
however, the meat was so good that i ate too much and got a stomach ache, so i couldn't properly enjoy the wine
these names were once known all over the universe. now, they've all but disappeared, leaving behind only masterless paths.
i hereby ask all parties to submit your support documents for evaluation. the documents should include scope of business, ratio of contributions, and registered capital.
the situation is critical. we cannot delay any longer!
transparent and clinking oh! i've got it!
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
i'm so grateful that miss navia was so understanding. to be perfectly honest, i didn't know if i was ready to meet her.
upon ingesting the brumedew concentrate pellet, you will feel the limitless freedom of the form bestowed upon you by merciful medicus
you probably imagine that mingxing jewelry deals exclusively in expensive luxury goods.
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do
ha, just kidding -- here you goooo~
a person is defined by their actions alone i think that's how the saying goes? if the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
as for the trade issues we raised, i will discuss options with the yashiro commission and make sure both sides have ample participation in the final arrangement
yeah, anyone could see that. i just wanted to hear you say it again.
i--i've never seen a robot with this kind of malfunction before what happened to it?
the express travels to so many worlds, it's hard to avoid running into difficult situations. having more skills can give you more protection.
haha, who would've thought? that you'd be so immensely popular in some weird circle.
very good. and murata?
i'll just assume that's a compliment! maybe next time, you could just say "silver-tongued."
only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. only if you are strong enough can i deliver you to the right destination.
ah, that reminds me. i believe what she actually said was, "so help me, i will figure out what i should do about this script."
let's just stop wasting time. just treat us to some milk tea, and then we can start our real swordplay training, okay?
lady guuji, i need you to be direct. tell me exactly what you mean.
i am sorry. it is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
nice to meet you, padisarah. i'm nilou, the fairy of this forest. from this day forward, this place is now your home.
sounds good to me, too. everyone makes mistakes. what matters is what you do to make up for them.
i know how much it means to you. it was a gift from your mom before she left liyue harbor, wasn't it?
actually, no aeur" forget that. far more trouble than it's worth.
none of these meka have serial numbers, i was sure to check a moment ago. they are not the ones used by the authorities to enforce the law.
ahh, don't think anything of it! i just help out when i can because everyone else takes such good care of me.
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
he used to say, "books are just a bridge that bring us a little closer to history. it's up to those of us in later generations to ask these questions, search for the answers, and decide what they mean."
where are the yaoqing messengers, and where's my sister? are they still alive?
it was a long time ago. the same time the underworld was sealed off, i think
when the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the grand narukami shrine. once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
well, you did get nerfed after turning into a good guy so, i guess i'm okay, too!
if mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then i am confident i can improve with more practice.
yes, i think i might ask souka to ditch her original characters and just make you the protagonists in her next novel.
absolutely. we've already exhausted all our other options.
but a peaceful society will probably mean less demand for mercenaries like me. before long, we'll be a dying breed, so i'd better get to work while i still can.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
if i roll a one, three, or five, you have to confess. you have to tell me a secret that no one else can ever be allowed to know.
but looking back, haven't you learned something more important than just swordplay?
shanghua is a business expert who gets his information by trading, wenyuan relies on word of mouth, and there is also wupei, who's not here right now
when you are free sometime, i'll take you to one of my favorite scary places to test your mettle -- what do you say?
some of these souls never made it to the ley lines, others escaped from the night kingdom, and even more don't even come from natlan complicated doesn't even begin to describe it.
(everyone is free to appreciate art aeur" no form of art is inherently superior.)
the footprints, which are half as big as standard, must belong to a pepeshi person.
why not? "miss sparkle's body" appeared in all three of those skits just then.
as i expected, it's come to your attention too. the memoria nearby has been mutating ever since slumbernana monkey gained popularity.
all gods don't have the same secrets, you know. she was herself, and i'm me. is it really so strange that i know nothing?
my dear citizens, my loyal audience, allow me to present my reasoning and bring this performance to a swift close.
in fact, we were only just tipped off. we're still working on the logistics of the arrest operation hmm? who's this
great, and it's barely damaged! nat wouldn't have expected her old supplies from years ago to have stayed in such good condition.
all i have to do is find out where they hid the fireworks, and then return to the location with reinforcements.
roping you in was possibly the most masterful move we could have made. i believe that future generations will say so too, when our deeds come up for their review.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
seriously? another competition? i thought we were supposed to be sightseeing. uh, but still aeur" wait for me!
no, hold on -- you have a stellaron within you. i think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. it might be dangerous if you stay for too long
oh, i can completely understand that. then let me ask you this do you remember roughly when the grownups started talking about zhiyi?
as long as bailu is in the pictures, we should be fine.
i understand, but i must protect those that believe in the architects
oh no what should we do
hmm? traveler? paimon? what are you two doing here?
you think you look alike?
the same thing applies here. at a mere glance, i can differentiate carved marks from the results of combat training.
my family set only the highest expectations for me, even as a child.
guyun flew out of the case on its own. the knight of beauty only unlocked the box to aid its escape.
oh, it's you. do you have something to report?
that cursed sword has messed with your ability to think, but i'll break you free from its grip! i'll shatter its illusion and the sword itself!
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
why would someone as talented as the master diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
but our audience isn't the akademiya aeur" it's the people of the grand bazaar.
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
you have already witnessed my previous views on eternity.
seems to me that it's been created using some illusory magic hidden behind it lies a passageway.
this new age started after that great battle, you know.
goodbye. i wish you a very pleasant weinlesefest.
but, since there are so many doors here we should be able to leave through one of them
even the toys he gave me would all be story props i'd get helmets, shields, and toy swords.
(right, i need to keep calm, but he)
i don't think i've ever been this far away from the xianzhou before! who'd have thought i'd be hopping star systems only to wind up on this cold, icy planet?
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
i had no idea what to say, i didn't know if i should object or just follow along
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
ninja hiryu is right. since i have already relinquished the super ninja scroll, i'll rely on my fists to awaken these ninja initiates that succumbed to the way of the fiendling.
ahem! now that that's settled time to get going. qingce village is said to be home to a lot of historical texts, so i'd like to start by making some inquiries there.
yeah, of course, every underworlder worth their salt knows how to fix a mine cart. let me see
no problem, but remember that a debate is like a duel. the more you hesitate, the farther you are from victory.
now the true challenge begins this is where it gets difficult.
but if i just marched straight in there by myself, i'd probably get miss kamisato in a whole heap of trouble, hehe
yes, in fact, we were just getting ready to leave.
the holy city's fate is as fragile as thread. i must exercise prudence in order to eliminate sources of potential disaster.
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless
indeed. we need only sound them out and--
the longest-serving general of the xianzhou luofu. do you think he'd have only a few enemies?
they say that many years ago, madam yukong was an ace pilot in the cloud knights. she was a "work hard, play harder" type, known for her hot temper and incredible skill.
and should our feathers be damaged, then we share our wings with one another.
mister svarog, are you okay? let me repair your language module first
hehe, is that so? how interesting. let's hear your reasoning, then.
we'll have to cut the banter short let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
that sounds like too cruel of an ending to me. and perhaps a little irresponsible to present to the audience.
i'm giving you my access card. give me your hand, and i'll input your fingerprint into it.
that won't be necessary, mister bolai. wanyou boutique's credit is not sufficient to accept orders directly from yuehai pavilion.
idyia is working on repairing the domain. we were just with her before coming here.
perhaps it has its own set of authorization mechanisms, and only those it recognizes are permitted to sit on it.
...by the way, would you like something to drink? before we go, how about two cups of wake the heck up...? no, four cups.
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
no, i've no need to trouble myself with such frivolous formalities. here, allow me to demonstrate.
since you are witnesses, i suppose i can shield you from arrest aeur" at least until i have received an explanation from takayuki.
she'll be dancing for us from now on, so please give her your support.
also, not all of them are bad people everyone just wants to survive.
i understand. you mean to say that we should be more informal in the way we interact with each other.
when i was designing it, i wanted it not only to be a fun game, but also capture liyue's culture in a unique way.
i'm relieved to know that you're safe and sound. well then, since you and elder huaiyan are here, i imagine you must have received orders from the marshal?
if you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask asta. if she's fine with it, i have no complaints.
oh? and how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? as for the debt we'll find a way to gradually repay it, but it'll take some time
this is my first time commentating for such a competition. i'm feeling kinda nervous.
oh? am i really so terrifying? well then, i'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up
in essence, someone rescued a drowning man and performed some music. if that were all there was to it, it could have been many people aeur" human or adeptus.
well, i do have to admit, your success is remarkable.
if the opportunity arises, i would like to take you diving with me.
i... have some unfinished business.
nah, i could've taken it on by myself. but still fighting alongside you two was pretty fun.
mister hirayama, the tenryou commission will continue by investigating the warehouse staff. if you come across any further clues, please notify us immediately.
what's the point of performing a show that its audience can't even follow?
there are still many guests arriving here. please be cautious!
you and your comrades will all be welcome to join aeur" but be warned, the training will be grueling. perseverance and grit will be in high demand.
interesting, don't you think? i fulfill people's desires and grant them favors, and soon, they come back to me with even greater desires.
the commission wouldn't normally cause this big of a fuss over a stowaway.
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
the club introduced a completely new kind of gameplay for this script.
and there you have it, that's the truth behind what happened
now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
mavuika already told you about her plan, and you've given so much help to ororon and me you deserved to learn the full truth.
it sounds much more pleasant to call an acquaintance a "dear friend." so another thing to remember aeur" aristocrats are concerned with face and being polite.
seeing as we're in penacony the answer is "sweet dreams troupe," right?
it's been a smooth ride... almost too smooth for a heavily guarded mansion.
the family itself is a huge, perfect building. like... a living idol.
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool
clara? don't worry about her. that girl is best pals with svarog -- she's always following behind him. he wouldn't harm her.
because you used dirty tricks to trample all over the honest work of others!
right! the guide says we should find a flat, dry, sheltered location -- facing the sun at high elevation
there are all kinds of wonders in the universe -- you never know what you might find with a telescope.
with one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. i hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
she looks so young. she was already famous in the last amber era, no? she has to be at least a hundred years old.
(just a little more. zubayr theater isn't just a performance venue to us)
aren't there other crew members we can take inspiration from?
the grand notion of eternity she once held has long since given way to the eternity of her own definition.
my apologies for rambling on just now
don't treat me like a new recruit. i'm all too familiar with the monsters of the fragmentum. let's get ready to fight!
another implies that you were already served some delicious cake while you were up there. hmm, how lovely.
i noticed you quietly completed that backlog of paperwork we had you deserve the chance to unwind a little.
for now, while i figure out the form that eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
to give a common example did you know that to varying degrees, most xianzhou natives are plagued by oral diseases and jaw-related conditions?
i'm sure you've all heard about how i have taken on the role of hydro archon. indeed, i am furina de fontaine, your new archon.
i did, yes. you're paying, after all.
if you can't forgive me right now, then... i--i'll reflect further and... find a way to prove that i'm willing to change.
well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that i am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
i wish to borrow a tea set from the yashiro commission.
if you feel it's necessary, we'll do what mister svarog suggested but until you're sure, i'll keep trying to find a way to save pascal's emotions and memories
come with me, we need to check the engine room! it's the heart of the ship, so we need to prioritize its safety!
and you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. hehehe
shards of a cloud knight's weapon. something really sharp caused this
i hope that it might be a highlight of your journey. if you ever grow weary in your travels, know that you can always come back and visit liyue.
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
i could have bought them back, but it's not in my nature to pay twice for the same thing. least of all when they'd be looking to make a handsome profit from my misfortune.
he cast aside his physical form in order to etch the memories of rage and sadness deeper into his being.
wait, you're not leaving?
svarog wants to preserve humanity, but he's not concerned about what humans truly think.
heh, that harbinger may have tried to cover his trail, but he still left some traces.
aww, what are you talking about? the fun's just about to begin.
he may well have had an inkling about there being two "raiden shoguns." but he always acted as if he was completely unaware of it.
while taking a walk by the lunarescent depths, i spotted general feixiao chatting with them. if you wish to visit them, you can head over there.
even so, it doesn't really solve anything
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves
the key to making sure a conversation goes well is choosing the right topic.
it should be a view i tire of seeing, but it always leaves me in awe the heavens really are boundless.
the illustrious merlin's claw waiting for me, and for so long, too? it's quite an honor. it's been a while, general feixiao.
you recognize the voice as belonging to the "guard" who led you to this place. it appears he now covets the treasure for himself, and has come to stake his claim
you bid farewell to the woman and continue your journey further into the city.
after all this is over, i'm putting my vacation time in with madam herta. i've got it all planned. i'll hop on an airship and give the blue a good look.
i'll leave negotiations to you guys. they're not my strong point.
and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
my schedule is usually very tightly packed, and any extra time i can squeeze out is spent on preparing for the future.
this guitar was actually given to me as a birthday present by cocolia a long time ago.
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
i just hope everything is smooth-sailing from now on -- please look after me.
you look stunning. you should be flaunting this look at every opportunity.
the eternal land, amphoreus.
why even bother to ask? if you were truly convinced of my intent to harm them, you would have intervened.
do you really think the hunters acted out of a desire for honor and glory, or to be loved and acknowledged by the people? what did your father teach you about our order?
just as you begin to celebrate your victory, a suspicious lump on the ground catches your attention.
and you've also heard all about ororon. i must say, he's always been a good kid. i can't see him joining the fatui of his own volition aeur" he must have been coerced somehow.
well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
it's not that i "know everything." it's just that i've been in your position before.
i have recently received multiple reports from the knights of someone within the lawrence clan having close dealings with the fatui.
speaking of which, does the express have a place specifically for storing weapons?
that should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
a lion has to return to the wild sooner or later. if anything, being your bodyguard has been unfamiliar territory for me.
haha. i was thinking the same thing. the feast will be held sooner or later, right?
deshret's relics may have been a force to be reckoned with before, but their name means nothing now.
yes, that's what i was talking about something strange has happened.
sugar-coating the facts, kind lies it's all a big waste of everyone's time.
uh an emergency response plan?
i go as the wind blows, so you may decide for me.
let me be clear about this: i did not mishear, nor is the wayob mistaken! we would never jest about something like this.
yes this is where we put an end to it all
i never thought you'd be such a bore. never mind! if you stick by me, everything will become clear.
let alone maintain it. to do that, you must buy a special kind of shrine and worship it properly.
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
she seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and it's related to the watchmaker.
as a merchant, staying well-informed is crucial. it's only natural for me to stay updated on the events of the luofu before i return.
i can see why you'd suggest that. you're thinking i could use my knowledge of how mora works to my advantage and make a lot of money there.
even a child's toy isn't safe from your grasp is greed one of your vices?
most of you were not aware of their arrival but it is thanks to them that our world now flourishes with hope.
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
...even the space station handbook doesn't get updated this frequently.
it was only much later when i realized that the shows were more for him than they ever were for me.
during the war, there were highs and there were lows, and in the end there was a glorious victory. for you, perhaps the experience was one of great excitement.
so reckless according to the rules of the silvermane guards, any expedition into the fragmentum must have a squad of at least four members, as well as a communications officer.
"whenever a dispute arises, protection of your family's prestige and dignity always takes precedence."
a "guardian of humanity" that can command robots? i've never heard of anything like
knight of beauty, you're the one who stole guyun, right? hand it over! you have no idea how dangerous that cursed sword is.
the boss he appeared suddenly after the guards were redeployed, and became a major player in the underworld.
what are all these swords doing in dragonprayer terrace?
someone with no spiritual sensitivity whatsoever. spirit-duffers can't sense or control spirits, much less use spells on them.
if i understood correctly, there are currently two problems in the kingdom that need solving, right?
what if i feel like giving up? what happens then?
is that so? i am delighted to hear it.
ah, boss, see these two faces here? remember them. they're the ones picking up the bill later.
the essence of turn-based games lies in the numbers, so you'd better get ready to witness the precision of my calculations!
ahem! yae miko said nothing of the sort, and the traveler has some nerve making up spurious claims about her while she is still present.
makes sense to me, i agree. the akasha is not alive, and i don't think we can be completely controlled by something without a mind of its own.
the pleasure is all mine, "sole of the deep."
their legacies shall continue to be passed down from generation to generation, as everlasting as the stone onto which their names are carved.
she has a long-standing conflict with her father. that's why she ran away from home.
now then, i always have my ways. it's just a question of how crafty i need to be
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
the atmosphere around here's not too bad nowadays, so i don't mind sticking around once in a while.
the matter has finally come to an end, but we mustn't lower our guard. increase patrols around qingce village and coordinate our people at other fireworks locations to prevent any further theft.
(oh, almost forgot about that title page he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
could it have malfunctioned? it appears to be normal
well, is that all you've got to say while your life is at stake? that's hardly worth anything.
they're my favorite flower, so i wanted to give them to you, my favorite person.
i was always looking forward to the day she'd return this guitar i thought that would be the day we could bury the hatchet.
its formal name is the "mechanism energy hub." it's connected to all the energy lines -- i would've thought it covers the entire restricted zone.
yep aeur" and in fact, their tale specifically emphasizes that most of them were ordinary humans!
do you remember what dugu shuo said about zhiyi's stories? clearly they left him with a good impression of the guy, but beyond that he wasn't interested in the details. that's the reaction i would expect from any normal person.
(good, he's said what he said. the next argument could decide this debate.)
i think i understand what's going on. it's not unusual to be anxious when you're far away from home. when your nerves were thrown into disarray, the sweet dreams soda you drank intensified it.
huh, i'm surprised you managed to track it down after all this time.
it's telling the truth mister svarog made a promise to me, and he never betrays his promises.
yes, of course. the best view should be from the jade chamber.
mm looks like i still have a lot to learn
hahaha, i was fishing around on your behalf through the channels that aren't accessible to you. unfortunately, i didn't find any leads worth pursuing either.
death is not part of our plan, lord gnaeus. we should work on solving the puzzle they've set for us.
i stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
but i am worried if the heliobus possessing yanqing is too strong, i'm afraid i might not be able to guarantee everyone's safety.
from what i can tell, in the past, if a student were to put off their studies to watch a show or dance, they'd be called foolish and irresponsible.
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near
geniuses like setaria are one in a million. the other children never get a single chance to try and rewrite their fate even though the akademiya knows very well that we're humans, just as they are.
but a well-trained aristocrat would not only effortlessly proceed forward, but do so without a stain on their garment and their elegance fully intact.
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
let me guess, you're someone who doesn't follow the rules, enjoys improvising, and can handle yourself well against tough foes. am i right?
i gave him a second chance -- does that not count?
huh i really didn't expect the people in the city to keep us at arm's length like that. i totally thought the hunters would be treated like heroes.
i played games with them, but i also taught them observation skills, analytical skills, how to think critically. i never taught business, though.
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
dear guests, if you would, i'd like you to please follow me
besides, the madam helm master simply asked me to assist you in navigating around starskiff haven. it's no different to any other diplomatic mission or delegate reception.
just to be safe, let's chase him and see what we find.
maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
anyway, that's not the important part! it's about mavuika's death aeur" her fate hasn't changed at all.
nice to meet you, i'm natasha -- an underworld doctor. feeling sick? take a seat, let me take a look.
the shrine maiden i tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. you'll know her when you see her.
past the reception hall, you'll find the general hall -- the museum's largest exhibition room.
although, if clara hadn't been here svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
hey, dunn! it's been a while. i didn't know you made security captain.
according to my grandpa, he and my great-uncle once went traveling together when they were young. they ended up at chenyu vale, where they met a pharmacist.
there's gotta be a better shot than this one!
anyway, i lent out one of her manuscripts as a resource reference not long ago. it should still be in the master control zone. you can take a look if you wish.
no wonder they like to use analogies such as "pawns" and "chess" to describe people. one momentary lapse of concentration, and suddenly we find ourselves backed into a corner.
recently, i have observed a number of changes in the external world from the plane of euthymia. the most serious of these being the attack on the sacred sakura by numerous rifthounds.
even in its fully functional state, the night kingdom can't accept foreign souls. it's completely isolated from the ley lines of other nations.
let's play truth and lies!
best not to ponder, you'll be scratching your chin all day.
wildfire wants everyone to leave the underground but mister svarog wants everyone to stay here. according to his calculations, the overground is already unsafe.
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
ready to roll? good. then let's pack up and move out.
be careful, benefactors. the disciples of sanctus medicus worship yaoshi the plagues author -- the greatest enemy of the xianzhou.
it's truly reassuring to have such outstanding members among our ranks.
as i thought, you've carefully observed the streets of liyue.
the only things that can stop such negative emotions are rationality and responsibility. this is a valuable lesson i've learned from mister svarog.
the training is much to her signature style i hope it won't make it seem like she is too unaware of the abilities of others.
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
it didn't seem to make much difference though. still, at least we can understand what he's saying i'll leave him alone for now.
i've made it this far in life without a single drop of my father's support.
hmm? is something else wrong?
master diviner, i've brought you the guests, though it wasn't your order i received.
the reason i'm willing to bet on you is because of your special status. i think it'll bring me a lot of leads that can get me closer to the truth heh, so, got any news for me today?
fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
i still have no further leads regarding the issue of potential collusion between the tenryou commission and the fatui.
this guitar i found it after going through mother's old things.
no, there's nothing funny about that and you know what? it's not a bad thing to care when other people are looking.
wait a second did you say "gnosis"?
but i've never seen any of the previous directors there, not even once.
your ability never ceases to surprise me
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
however, not all eremite brigades are like mine. some are willing to cross all kinds of lines for the sake of mora. the most notorious is a faction known as "deshret's relics."
what a coincidence! someone else who refuses to listen to the doctor's orders.
can you see the express in boulder town? why does it fly in the sky? who is the conductor?
before one makes a plan, what is the most important thing one must do?
here's what i need you to do: go into town and find evidence of the tenryou commission's betrayal.
penacony, the land of the dreams is this truly the paradise you desire?
this body is an assistant to the one within. but it is also the guardian of the rules.
...so, come with me. i'll take you home.
uhh if you can, please try not to upset mister svarog
i'll let you make three moves.
then, the holy city shall also uncover their hiding place and sound the horn of retaliation.
okay, okay, i promise this is the last time.
but now that i have your help, the idea is feasible
these are memetic remnants of the remembrance?
i'll be there once i am finished inspecting this place.
great, well, now satomi can get started on that.
greetings, miss robin. i didn't expect to meet you here.
i've even thought of the design already, but it's a secret! then it'll be a surprise the next time we meet! don't you think so?
may the wind open your eyes to the truth.
understood, ninja hiryu aoi dan heng.
traveler, paimon, do you know this self-proclaimed bard from mondstadt?
the thief has stolen parts again? how am i going to track down this crook?
ahhhh, which means what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
you sense it too, don't you collei? something's not quite right.
i still don't get it, though. didn't the astral express already depart some time ago? is that world so incredibly spectacular that it warrants this return trip?
when this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
this sum was paid by northland bank, so they are still wary of me to this day.
shall we roll some dice? whoever gets the lowest number gets to eat it.
i'm afraid so. there are still other people who need my help. i won't go far, though, and i'll come back to visit the minute i have time to spare.
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair
finished, huh? what did you think?
if i had rushed in and out back then, i wouldn't have been much help. instead, i would've postponed the trip and sought assistance from allies, but in that case
although i am no longer required to play the role of the hydro archon, the time i spent inhabiting that character has left an indelible mark on me.
not a smart way to operate. the luofu is more dangerous than ever -- i can't let you put yourself in harm's way.
no one knows what he did after he left jarilo-vi, and why he decided to come back.
you're afraid afraid to accept that the fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
hmm yes, i feel a lot more energetic now, thanks to you.
i think that this is beneficial to them.
general, this is an internal affair for the luofu
the theater provides money for ms. rekhar and her children, inspiration for mister khasani, and enjoyment for the people of the great bazaar.
still, since the clues are pointing toward the blackcliff forge, we should see where they lead. we may well find something new.
see you in the qualifiers. blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
an abrupt ending to an epic that has barely begun might also amaze the people.
additionally, most of the things here are static. so if we really do manage to escape, then once time starts moving normally again the fantastic compass will likely disappear.
a persons's footfall reveals a lot about their strength and emotions -- much like how a person's breath may serve as an indication of their overall health.
no, this is a borisin in disguise. a guard killed him before he could return to his original form.
on behalf of the people of mondstadt, please offer your windblume to the statue.
she doesn't think that we can win the debate, and she doesn't want to implicate us, so she thought leaving was the best thing to do
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
oh, and don't forget to return the pass permit to me after you have finished with it.
but the smarter ones wouldn't have joined the game in the first place. see? i'm smarter.
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
they received eternal life as they had desired, but are doomed to a fate more terrifying than death. the abundance played a cruel trick on them.
that's impossible. it was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting
no need. i already talked to some other knights, so i think i have fairly good understanding of the situation.
this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
naeur"not at all. this is just my duty.
all joking aside, i'm glad you're here. let's get moving and take care of this as soon as possible.
hmm? alhaitham didn't go with you?
by true-to-life, you mean the director's sudden disappearance?
that's the advantage of planning this far in advance it was a clever move.
a planet covered in snow and ice will i find my answer here?
yes, those photos are not just ordinary records of her trips. to miss march, they are dearly precious memories.
hehe, there's really no need -- i've spent my years traveling the universe! not to mention, i'm younger and stronger than i look.
don't worry, sushang. right now, i'm cool as a cucumber inside a block of ice!
ha, not interested -- i need time, not money!
i feel a warmth from these emotions. i feel drawn to this quality, and try to respond back in my own way
relax, you've got me. just bring me along the next time you go to the desert, and i'll handle everything for ya.
i've checked the lines, there don't seem to be any major problems. all that's left is the energy hub.
huh? can coffee get rid of dark circles under your eyes? no wonder it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission
allow me to take the investigation matters from here. you needn't worry any longer.
did the medicine have any side effects for you?
i didn't know there were so many great and mysterious beings in the universe it goes to show just how tiny and fragile we really are.
you look like you're raring to go. not surprising, given how comfy this place is. i slept like a log last night.
well how else was i supposed to save your skin from the balladeer, exactly?
the two of you may be just the "reinforcements" that the chrysos heirs have been waiting for.
of course, i know! well, i know a little. my mum made me practice with swords all day -- i didn't really go to school
i'll fight it to the end. no matter what.
yeah, i'm up for that! and if i kick your butt, you'll drop out of the wardance. deal?
congratulations. you attained your very first victory in this tug of war. it's a good start.
how did everything go? any luck with your missions?
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
wow, the general recognizes me? i didn't realize i was so famous!
looks like we're the only ones in good spirits today
now that you are vanquished at our feet, allow me to recite to you the ninja mantra--
sometimes i wonder whether your head's screwed on right. we need to take you to the alchemy commission for a check-up.
it's an ancient tree -- we call it the ambrosial arbor. it was once the xianzhou luofu's prized treasure.
i usually get woken up by random loud noises, so it was a surprise to wake up naturally this morning. to be honest, it's quite an unfamiliar experience.
d--don't worry lynxy! i'm sure you'll get concrete proof one day
the secrets of history shine through in the relics that survive, and this one now has the story of another age to tell.
very good! the wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later
judging by the look on your face, i'm guessing you saw something a little unpleasant in there?
suddenly, you hear footsteps outside the door.
um i know you're working hard for the people down here, but mister svarog doesn't trust human emotions. he only trusts his calculation results.
we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. let's go check out the wharf where he usually goes fishing.
then again, i suppose your frankness is part of your charm.
i am sangonomiya kokomi, organizer of the resistance, and also the divine priestess of watatsumi island.
it's hard to imagine how he managed to suppress his hunger for over seven centuries. will the hostage from the yaoqing be able to avoid being his meal?
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
but if this went on forever would it get boring too?
the marshal believed that this would be inhumane and no different from what the borisin did, so
to reciprocate, in the upcoming confrontation, if the odds aren't in the astral express' favor... i will stand with you.
first, you use thin strips of bamboo to construct the frame, then you draw a design of your choice on a piece of paper, paste it onto the frame, and tie on the string
yeah. i'm acting as everyone's representative, so i'll need to act brave, even if i won't feel like it.
so be it. if indeed he is fate's chosen child
you care about her, huh. you must have become close friends.
as long as we can gain access permissions to the hub, we can operate the gear bridge terminals.
i'm surprised anyone has the guts to try and pull off something like this during the extravaganza. just goes to show how tempting a fortune like sachin's is.
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time train or no train.
hehe, that sounds great. i'm looking forward to it.
excuse me, are you talking about the clock studios theme park incident?
this man on the wanted list he's a stellaron hunter, right? is that?
this is an automaton direwolf, but it appears to have been modified. it's most likely another abandoned robot pet
just my conjecture, but i doubt it's far from the truth. my brother mentioned that they've had to use extreme measures to repel the fragmentum monsters.
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
oh, no, it's alright. i actually think i understand the magic of this world a bit better now. thank you.
to begin with, let's set him to scent detection mode~
ninja hero? huh, it seems that my trial has finally come to an end
but i know you're going to say "but," right?
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work)
they must perform these extra measures in addition to their standard daily affairs. the only manpower they can muster during the festival would be the emergency response units.
but if we wish to mount any sizable resistance against the vision hunt decree there is still much to be done.
for your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
time sure flies. now, both my sister and i are residents of the netherworld, and we will never again feel the thrill of a competition.
even if we got rid of one bunch of radicals, there are others out there. wiping them out would do more harm than good.
right, now let's go hunt down this harbinger
you bet! once we're done here i'd be glad to!
and on that note, i'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to a few guests of the city.
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions
yeah. i've fixed a lot of things before, but i never had to repair one as complicated as this.
haha, let's go then. first, we need to think of a way to get to the other side.
don't look at me, i told you i'm not taking a chance with that thing.
you think? i really like it. i'm not good at it though -- silver wolf always manages to guess right.
i see. alright, i'll inform the police station. they'll take you into the warehouse.
what happens next is going to blow your mind
so, "dear friend" don't die on me out here.
yeah. she said, "dance is an art born from toil. it isn't a gift from the gods, but a creation by our own hands."
there is no need to tell me your answer. i just felt like asking the question. how should i take care of them? perhaps leaving them at the space station is the best choice.
good. then i'm free to alter the script as i see fit?
my "own" way ha, i don't even remember what kind of life i want.
let's go find my lady again. we'll tell her everything, and see if she's willing to lend us her support.
i have loved that song since i was small.
hmm? did you come up with that story?
try to relax and enjoy yourself while you're here. get some rest.
a souvenir for myself? that's definitely an idea i can get behind.
but is your shop part of the future that the ipc promised?
for example my name is sangonomiya kokomi, the divine priestess of watatsumi island
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would
i am deeply disappointed in you, elder. your thoughts and intentions are completely devoid of empathy. cloud knights!
people's lives are at stake. why wouldn't you want another person to help? besides, i have some experience with the fragmentums. i'm sure i will be of use.
then please, master diviner, witness my destiny.
look, everyone. isn't this the dango milk we are searching for?
but now, i've also learned that while these merchant principles may apply to humans, they falter in the face of the gods.
all kinds of spectacular scenes appeared in front of the first sage, as if all the knowledge in the world was being painted onto a canvas right before him. he was captivated.
i will. thank you for your invitation.
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
when the marechaussee phantom searched pierre's house, there was no sign of these barrels, right?
that's right -- we can't really know what a heliobus is thinking, right? tail was sealed away for ages and then suddenly let free if it were me, i'd want some away time.
the xianzhou need brawny warriors with their swords and spears, as well as unpredictable waters like her who travels freely and unrestrained.
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract goes against everything the nameless are about.
i--it's not that i don't trust you it's just
after making some inquiries, i found them to be most uncooperative. so i had to resort to this auction to finally put a stop to all this nonsense.
i will employ every means at my disposal to save amphoreus, elder caenis. whether it means wresting it from the grasp of the gods
phainon, will you fulfill your duty as host and look after our distinguished guests?
i think i just saw a group of void song whales fly past the window.
yes looking after these little rascals is rather exhausting.
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver i just want to get there in one piece.
who knows, perhaps you will have a completely different impression of me after i change outfits.
seriously? it's the first day, and you two are already late? why is everyone on the luofu so laid-back? so disappointing.
ahem! you there, lowly laborer. you stand in the presence of a member of the illustrious lawrence clan. i have words for you.
tch, it's called being a professional. i'm a bodyguard, and i work for whoever's paying.
whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. did i miss anything big while i was gone?
general jing yuan, general huaiyan, it's just as we suspected the rise of the ambrosial arbor was not the end of things, but the beginning.
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
so i'm not going to perform, and that is that.
mister dvorak, i will need to discuss with you the number of musicians who will be coming to liyue, as well as their catering and accommodation requirements
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
yeah i can tell people are watching me.
it's hard to refuse a generous offer like that yes, i think we can fit this in.
oh, there's no mask that can hide true bloodlust. cover up your eyes and it'll still show itself at the corners of your mouth.
the qixing have prepared some small gifts for you to celebrate this festive occasion. there are some seasonal goods, two bolts of fine silk, and some exotic flower seeds which i picked specifically for you, madame ping.
as you wish. it's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
this time we're playing the role of a real detective but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
are you leaving? yeah, it's about time for me to go, too i've taken enough time out for one day.
but tell me, why should this concern me? why should i do this for you, when i already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
huh? why do you look so excited?
ms. rekhar has gone through a lot in her life, but she told us that she's very happy to live at the theater now.
if uncle schubert didn't commit any wrongdoing, then any such investigation will prove fruitless.
now, from the gold, blue, and rainbow decks of cards, please pick the deck that fits you best.
then i'll leave that to you. macaroni's on sale today, so i've got to go. you can just tell me how things went when we discuss tomorrow's plan later.
"square meals in the basement: big bowls of rice, decorate with cuboids of meat."
anyway, the treasure hoarders discovered some previously unexplored ruins that the abyss order has been secretly guarding in the shadows.
feels like we're not getting many friendly looks, huh.
one of the ancient sorcerers of remuria used his power to assemble a formidable army of golems. he sought to use that force to establish himself as king.
the golden thread has exposed your hesitations. regrettably, the both of you have failed the test.
though i should warn you, most people aren't exactly enamored with my conversation.
taking all that into account, did we get lucky, or was aurum alley always destined to pull through?
and its story won't end here. in the future, many more people will come to the theater and receive its blessing.
i know this is a lot to ask out of the blue, so apologies in advance.
you remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. the woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
as a precaution, please bring sufficient combat equipment and supplies with you.
one day, i believe it will overshadow all seven nations.
but you've been looking forward to the dance of sabzeruz so much, and i know how important this festival is to you. i don't want you to have any regrets
i will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, i need you to do two things:
but seeing as you're a hero who's been all over teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
it was nothing special, really. geovishaps don't understand the concept of a "pet." so, basically, it just headbutted me whenever i entered its territory.
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
hmm, i'll have to take a good look.
that sounds like a great outlook on life. you have a very optimistic spirit.
favor? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
thank you for your concern, dear. but, believe me, i am quite comfortable wherever i go.
i want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. it meant a lot to me.
for instance, it was certainly a pleasant surprise for me today to meet top talents from all around teyvat.
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
and by the way, the ministry has requested the millelith to increase security along travel routes. how is that proceeding?
oh, we retrieved those already aeur" no need to worry.
oh, so we're all here with time to spare. what a treat!
your companionship this is one change that i shall not contest.
is it true that hilichurls grow stronger from eating sunsettias? surely it should be some sort of meat, at least?
what about the soldiers who gave their lives on the front line, or the hardship endured by the people? do they deserve no mention!?
yeah, she isn't the same as before, but
i'm sorry i really can't help you with this.
i wonder how their relationship is now.
there's been some work done on this place in the past, but it's a bit of a labyrinth inside. i can't guarantee we'll be safe once we're underground.
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
actually, we are still investigating. it's just that we've discovered something strange.
pay attention to what you see in your peripheral vision, and you might just stumble upon what you're looking for.
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
no, no, of course not! are you lesser lord kusanali?
she told me that whenever she's feeling troubled, she finds a quiet corner in the artisanship commission and just sits there, letting the sounds wash over her.
it's an ore -- a special energy resource. whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on geomarrow.
i'll hazard a guess that this is how you got that interview at the fortress of meropide.
"dealt with before"? so "death" does happen in penacony, if i understand correctly?
this is indeed a mysterious case.
hand them to sara. she can examine them for herself.
wow. good guess yes, i want to know for sure whether sacrificing one of the participants is a necessary part of the method or not. i figured she might know.
she's a flower-growing drummer and a great report writer. name a more reliable girl. i'll wait.
it was unfortunate that you didn't register for the tournament as well.
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
this jack's placement is odd. the chip is buried deep inside. if you don't look closely enough, you won't even find it
welcome, dear guests from the express. judge hanya of the interrogation division, we've met before.
but did he ever teach you how to deal with the mara-struck?
it's okay. they're all my guests.
of all the things i could have bought, i thought it would be best to have the money go to you. that way, i can support a charitable cause while i'm at it.
unfortunately, you're unable to adequately assess the source of his injury, much less come up with a way to relieve his pain.
yeah, but don't worry, my lady, it's all water under the bridge to me now. i had a huge argument with my father, and left that place behind for good.
it's not urgent, so there is no need to leave immediately. i suggest you take a few days to familiarize yourselves with the army and also with watatsumi island.
look how happy they are! it's clear they trust you a lot.
that was my final question, thank you. we all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.
if you're second-guessing how you look, you can forget about looking glamorous aeur" even the finest garments in the world will look out of place on you.
until the bids exceed the value of the item you're after, you can keep raising the price. if the bids go beyond what you can accept, then you let someone else take it.
huh reminds me of the accusations against me. cocolia's methods haven't changed.
if it's her, she will earn the respect and assent of all the vidyadhara on the luofu.
but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
but today, lord phainon okhema needs you.
according to the report, lord ravager phantylia is the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.
they are counting on us to vanquish the titans, reclaim their coreflames, topple them from their thrones, and take their authority for ourselves.
yeah, and even if someone gets their hands on such a precious sword, it'll probably end up in someone else's.
i'm also keen to lay eyes on this so-called dodo-king. all of you, follow me. let's investigate.
i'm quite familiar with dragonspine by now.
this swing is covered in dust hey, don't sit on it! it's filthy!
swords have a temper. sometimes, you have to touch them to calm them down -- put the hilt of the sword in your hand, and it'll tell you what's wrong!
in my estimation, there's no question about it. this is murder.
hmm generally speaking, this should be the point where the script writer gives the players some kind of hint, or gives the gm some kind of code for how to move forward.
please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, uhh what comes next? oh, right! by solemnly kneeling to the ground with utmost sincerity.
right now, let's follow her train of thought and head to the next puzzle. i hope this time we can get ahead of the bloodhound family. i want to try and avoid using my memokeeper powers.
no, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. in the meantime, i'm sending someone i trust to go with you.
if there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. i'm always happy to listen to other people's problems who knows, i might even try to help you come up with a solution.
since i was a kid, it's been clear to me that not everyone deserves to have a weapon in their hands. giving them a sword is no different than being cruel to the innocent.
i'm not good at acting all master-like. since grandpa asked me to teach you swordplay, i won't hold back any secrets.
so the interastral peace broadcast specifically broadcasts the news? that's exactly what old mettle likes.
this is my duty. i don't see it as an inconvenience.
mister zubayr and mister khasani took charge of the design, while inayah and i made all the little pieces with the help of others.
i know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the dreamscape than others. this is also why i have to accompany you.
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
(dehya and candace are both pretty tall. that means they have a lot of options when it comes to clothes)
it's a long story
like the time guinaifen dragged me to fyxestroll garden so i could protect her, but i was so scared i ended up fainting
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
you really have a knack for asking the most uncomfortable questions, don't you
sound promising! i'll meet you in the underworld, then.
but if that's all it is, there's also no reason to go so far as to demolish the theater.
there's a fault with one of the energy supply units at the base. if i don't repair it soon, everyone at the settlement will be affected.
he regards you with suspicion for quite some time, before shaking his head. perhaps he's finally accepted that you're here to help.
remember, you must be elegant don't get knocked or launched into the air.
for the holy city, i am willing to bear all the traits that others despise and use every heartless yet effective trick in the book.
especially that little bird named tubby. looks like she has her own teapot, what's up with that?
we all train under grandpa's guidance, learning the art of craftsmanship and swordplay. that's how we got that title, i guess.
but from now on, you should better attend to your duties. there's no need to keep kano nana worrying all the time.
yes, but only for those who cross the line. melting their swords is my way of protecting those weapons.
i could hardly happen upon vidyadhara bone marrow and test the prescription myself, could i?
i have to applaud the great magician for the level of professionalism he displays in his craft. if i ever have the time, i would very much like to enjoy one of his shows as a regular audience member.
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
that thought has even crossed my mind a few times. it's like saying, "what's wrong with adapting to a new life?"
shh, follow me. keep quiet and tread lightly
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
we're all here but where's the president?
it is by the will of the gods that you stood on okhema's side in the end.
i have been meaning to have a word with you if the occasion presented itself, but as you know, mondstadt's safety must always be my first priority.
ahh, the time is late, and even my tail is falling down. my apologies, i will be excusing myself
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
the eremites have been struggling to make ends meet recently, so a lot of groups have been doing "private" work that involves the rich.
though i've never gone diving together with anyone before, i must say that i certainly look forward to it.
not only that, urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," to become the most popular in inazuma.
have you made up your mind, firefly?
we at the tenryou commission will forever remember your contributions to our cause. i will be sure to reward each and every one of you properly once this is all over.
inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. hmph.
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
qingxu pool is always crawling with monsters. most people wouldn't dream of going there. it's one place they won't need to worry about being seen.
we've got quite a long walk back to the city let's take our time. it'll give me a moment to figure out how to explain all this.
these guys are my assistants. we need to overhaul all the installations here.
it was good of mika to bring the letter back all this way. knowing that everyone is safe and sound is the best encouragement i could ask for.
it's been over a decade since the silvermane guards withdrew from the underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. the only contact we have is the exchange of geomarrow for goods.
in the past whenever i heard the sound of those tunes, i always felt that they were worlds apart from me.
all of this was so encouraging to hear. it made me feel that my dear old companion's sacrifice was not in vain.
ha, i was protecting you more like -- it's a cloud knight's job to protect others. this area is under martial law, i'm escorting all civilians to safety. follow me.
you know what? he's got me excited too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
go to a corroded town to collect some useful resources? i'm in.
if tears were worth money, i could depend on them to become the richest person in the cosmos!
okay, story time. so, whenever kouichi brings one of his friends from the trade association to see me, they always mention how they used to play with me when i was a kid, or held me once as a baby, or something.
if she has nowhere else to go after leaving the theater, she might go back and strike out on her own again.
they are entitled to that rage because lord mydei was once the hero of castrum kremnos.
the aim is to try not to get hit by the attacks. since you've escaped certain death at her hand once already, i presume this shouldn't be more than you can handle?
we just taught you a lesson, but clearly, you weren't paying attention.
normally, of course, i would come to purchase one myself. but on this occasion, my duties at the irodori festival had to take priority.
yes i have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.
i take back what i said. we have to hurry to that memory zone where miss firefly's presence was imprinted. considering what this person can do
everyone thought he would be happy he survived, and he never really said anything to the contrary. but, just as i was about to put all of it behind me
dango with milk hmm, i've never heard of it. what made you want to do this?
that's certainly what the clan genealogies claim, although my personal knowledge of qimen divination is very patchy.
you have mountains, and bodies of water, food and fun, and everything to like!
it's alright, relax. i'm just here to look around. i'm having a change of pace today.
you've figured me out, huh? hahaha. alright, i'll quit pulling your leg.
but that's fun too -- the masked dreams connect to each other seamlessly, like you're walking in a maze. maybe one day, i'll find the way out!
let me be clear, the questions i'll ask might not reflect my actual thoughts. so, please don't take offense if any of my questions seem a bit harsh.
do i really have to go back to the luofu?
on behalf of the ten-lords commission, i commend you for your great service in resolving the divination commission crisis. i will honor all of you before the ten lords.
after leaving inazuma, hmm i think it would be easiest for you to go to sumeru.
is it? i just want them to try it. it would be a shame for them to miss out on dango milk.
i heard from other alchemists you have a prescription you wish me to assess can you read it to me?
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
but we can leave that for later let's take care of the malfunctioning puppets first.
but the fact is that both the food and the stories have changed with time
i'll go have a look around. traveler, please go take a rest in qingce village.
however, i doubt anyone would believe me, given there are no signs of a fight.
so, you do have a brain somewhere in all that muscle.
is there really no difference between our strategy and the ipc's?
alright, we should be getting back to the harbor as well. we don't want to keep her waiting.
they didn't recognize me. from what i could tell, they were drinking coffee and talking about one of the operas that started running recently.
a duty-bound soldier and a resistance leader it's hard to be rock 'n' roll in front of people like that.
not many from outside liyue earn the right to ascend to the jade chamber. but i have been in correspondence with the acting grand master of the knights of favonius, who spoke highly of you.
you've got style with those moves, but you're not striking where it counts. it's such a shame to see you misuse your sword like that.
perhaps you thought i'd planned an intensive training session for you? heh, that won't be necessary. on the contrary, when you're constantly on edge, you miss quite a lot of important things.
but i know nothing about swordplay or duels. now, if you're talking about playing celestial jade, that's something i might be able to help with.
i say you belong to the space under the manhole cover, not in a dream. there's one right over there. off you go!
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
thank you all very much. i promise you that i will create a bright future for inazuma.
mika tells me that rather than rejoining the expedition party, grand master told him to return to his post in eula's reconnaissance company after delivering the letter.
ah, don't worry. i just want to talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
never mind. i bet you did that on purpose. tell me, spirithief, why are you hiding in the filth?
you're that excited to hear about my fight with the vishap?
it seems you haven't heard yet. the theme of this year's lantern rite is "kites."
you're saying the kujou clan betrayed the shogunate?
barbara is always happy-go-lucky when she sees such beautiful scenery.
in exchange, i will be accompanying everyone to this letter's golden apple archipelago. as for the knights' affairs, i have entrusted them to kaeya.
i'm sorry, i had a meeting with cloud retainer, i
"observes the potential of the temporal plane." they say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to time.
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
outlanders, why have you come to amphoreus?
i'm happy to help, too. this is a beautiful city, and just like the forest of blessings, i would love to see it return to normal as soon as possible.
the profoundest of the profound is the musou no hitotachi. a sword art without parallel in all the world. with you as my sparring partner, i can perfect that technique even further.
c'mon if you learned how to play, then you, welt, and march would only need to find one more person! you could get a table going and play a few rounds during your travels.
in other words, you and i are each other's destiny.
the general said there are traitors aboard the ship.
mm you're right, it probably doesn't
that's right. dreams themselves may be imaginary, but they're also experiences that can never be relived or replicated.
haha, as long as you're willing to listen, i'm happy to share.
don't worry, paimon. the shogun's chosen envoy may be strong, but tomorrow's match doesn't prohibit the use of visions. we'll make a formidable team.
my people are used to the desert life but still, i hope that one day, they'll be able to find an oasis of their own, and leave the sandstorms behind for a better life.
anyone else who comes into this domain in the future will take one look at the ruins before them and conclude that this place was abandoned years ago.
so now, i'll become a cunning speck of dust and make those masterminds behind the curtains
yes, every celebration must come to an end.
he has his own goals and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
you're saying you like how i wear my vision? you certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. well then, i bet you'd like to pet it.
(wait so, as long as you pass the check, you can pretty much do anything, and it won't be seen as absurd?)
oh, hehe hopefully you'll be the last one i meet for a while then
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
all the signs point to one thing aeur" a truly devastating battle just took place here.
i i don't know much about warfare, but i don't see why a commander needs to lead the charge. the situation here is totally different from the restricted zone.
hmm hey! those look like handprints on the side of the cabinet -- human handprints. could this monitor have been recently used by someone?
thanks for your help. the elemental flow is finally stable.
this time, let's try something a little more challenging.
let me take a look. this puppet should be #twenty-seven fifty-seven.
i almost feel bad for him. aurum alley's enemy should be the ipc, not the president.
with the help of the guard, you successfully escape the dungeons. your sense of despair and anxiety both seem to fade as you continue your quest.
i found out from other sources that the harbinger "regrator" got involved.
we shouldn't tarry here any longer. take care, you two ahem! three.
our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. see you later.
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of the hunt.
"greedy spirit, greedy spirit, you made the moon run a ring"
so, i'm going to tell the shogun the truth about all this. if nothing else, my conscience will be clear!
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all that's really weird.
oh, did i mention? ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the grand narukami shrine.
no worries, i hope things go smoothly.
that won't work. firstly, the act of bringing a new team of guards to a neutral negotiation site will put both sides on high alert.
so when it approached and attacked joel what was that? a trial run?
your confidence actually makes me even more worried this isn't like helping a child make a snowball.
i'll bet, poor you this time we're gonna avenge you! i'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
is there anything else in your "script" about me? i'd like to know what kind of footnote "i" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?
why would i make this more difficult for you? we're on the same side here.
i've thought about it this responsibility rests on bronya's shoulders, not mine.
hmm you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet
you ready yet? if you want to keep wasting time, i'll just go on ahead by myself.
looks like everyone got out unscathed, but you all look pretty exhausted. rest up, there's no hurry to move on from here.
the taste is fairly standard, but i can see you worked hard at it.
yes. and just like your piece, the jade chamber piece will be scaled for the game.
i've got more than a dozen siblings! one of them is my older brother -- he's also living on the xianzhou. his name is langshile, but he seems to prefer being called "lancelot."
of course they did! when people mention the gods, they always think of the archon war, but sumeru's gods also had happy times.
you've spent long enough living in lies, bronya. this is your chance to break out of the cage.
behold, the winner of the "most awesome researcher" contest.
i'm just worried that if we don't get down to business soon, i'll take up too much of your time.
but lemme make something very clear: i'm only doing this because i respect your determination, not because i agree with you.
as in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
i'm not in charge of finance. go pose that to asta instead.
i will leave the tenryou and yashiro commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
i understand. you helped a lot of injured people in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies. you're good people.
um no, there's one more thing we still need to find out why pascal was stealing parts in the first place.
i just remember being taken care of by you when i was young. once the archon war came to an end, i stayed behind in liyue harbor to honor my contract.
ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy i sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
that's right. he was not only one of the six heroes, but also a legendary border master of our tribe. five hundred years on, and the remains of his spirit is still so strong
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. the strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
the fact you're standing here right now must mean things are pretty much taken care of?
i am glad to finally meet you in person, guests from the astral express. i'm feixiao, the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
in the end, the lantern rite planning was left to keqing and myself. i am the head organizer, while keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
when the desert-dwellers set off on their quest for knowledge, a sage once said, "knowledge always comes at a price."
thank you. i was really delighted to learn that you also entered the competition
an inquisition spirit? on the express?
well? feeling less worried now?
i trust that nobody would object to the ending of the story being based on aurelie's true feelings?
besides, my problem with him wasn't that he was a strict father
why so serious?
there's no point questioning or suspecting me. you're the iudex, but you're still my subordinate aeur" you should be following my lead.
be on your way, now. oh, and take care of yourselves, too. granny itztli will display her dashing self on the competition grounds soon enough.
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
you wouldn't want the stellaron in you to hurt all the people in the space station either, right?
well, i guess i can't get you the stars, or the moon. but pretty much anything else.
it was close to the statue of the seven. back then, the people of this island recognized the shogun's existence, despite not venerating her as the shogunate do.
but didn't someone work hard to make this? i can't just take it from here
like master, like student i admire your attitude. in any case, if this concerns the fragmentum, then there's no time to lose. where are the monsters? lead the way.
you said this was the first step, right? so just how many steps does your training have, exactly?
the technology wasn't mature enough at that time, so the excavation project was shut down, and the "treasure" became a mere legend.
mister gallagher, you even know my name?
well now you get why i didn't want to share any of this with you.
i've faced many opponents in my duels. most of them, i defeated. the rest surrendered. hm? no. i have never lost a duel.
but, i couldn't fall asleep just anywhere aeur" i needed somewhere private. i didn't want anyone to overhear me sleep-talk or watch me contort myself into some weird position
i'm all for work-life balance, but i think this is pushing it.
thank you for your words of comfort. you make a very good point.
get with the program, would you? this is a covert surveillance operation. zhiyi may be vigilant, but that doesn't mean the same is true for his drinking buddy.
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
yes. idyia had the water droplet send us a message just as the show was coming to an end, so we came back here to wait for you.
besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the grand narukami shrine unless you had a request for me, too. this is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
i wonder what stories have been left behind in the memory fragments that we found today?
why else did you think i was investing so much time and effort into this case?
at the westernmost part of natlan. it's a very remote location, far away from any of the tribes. there never used to be a settlement there, but there's been more people since the mare jivari disappeared.
still, now that we know how bloodbranch coral works, i, as divine priestess of sangonomiya, may need to think of a new way to counteract the holy soil phenomenon.
this tastes amazing! i'd better not have any more, or i'll never be able to go back to my usual rations.
...my answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.
indeed it seems that you understood what i meant to say from the very beginning.
heh, either way, i'm not here to twist your arm. you needn't worry.
stop staring at me with those wary eyes!
it seems the ground collapsed during our little confrontation up there. perhaps because we triggered the elemental forces
does she know that she has already passed away?
and so when he learned this piece of information, he realized that the victim had created their own locked-room mystery.
don't worry, what with me being a knight of favonius, they're usually willing to speak a few words with me.
that's easy. i'll just write a "do not disturb" on the mask and avoid interacting with people, right?
to be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed" but we did escape.
when the jade chamber fell, countless valuable items from my collection plunged into the sea. i organized a salvage operation, but still there were many items unaccounted for.
(no, that's ridiculous, don't be silly i bet ororon sold me out, the little scamp)
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
it's called liyue millennial. based on classic chess, but with different rules.
by the way remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
our responsibility is to get a status update on the fatui harbinger known as the doctor. we need to make sure he won't get in our way when we rescue lesser lord kusanali.
i knew you'd come around. on the xianzhou you're the only person i can turn to for help.
food preferences? that's a little unexpected.
anyway, i guess i should be thanking you. i haven't seen miss dunyarzad that happy in a long time. if wasn't for you two, she probably would've been caught and dragged back much earlier.
what's wrong? if it's too much trouble, please, there's no need to force it.
nope. i met him and you at the same time.
i'll let sakujirou know after we get back.
recovering, slowly but surely i should be raring to go before too long.
yes, you're right. after all, the shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
we've helped pascal find compatible hardware. if we can eliminate the muddled information without damaging the sectors linked to his emotional intelligence
i see, so you had big shots helping you. i guess that won't be of much help to sakujirou.
last but not least, zhiyi. his manifesto is full of pertinent details, his methodology is sound, and his proposals cover a broad range of fields, which is quite a rare feat.
compared to the aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of aeons and the paths.
i suppose we can slow down for now then
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie
i took a "mutually assured destruction" button and repurposed it into a "sky full of sparkles" button i really wanted to give you an epic fireworks show!
come quick! i've brought you a shiny little thing. open up the box and take a look!
hmm well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, i wouldn't say no.
oh! sorry, i spaced out whatever works for you.
at this point, i would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you but i think you get the picture now, don't you?
didn't you hear him? he said he needs to take care of a few matters in the city first. if we're fast enough, we can stay out of his way.
the souls of the sacrificed are still wandering this hall i hear their endless bemoaning, their senseless deaths have left them wronged, their mournful wails echo endlessly.
i'm just bubbling with energy we'll make a formidable force in our next fight.
no can do, mister -- it's way too late. you won't find anyone at starskiff haven. if your friends made it out, then they'll already be in the safe zone. no need to worry, you'll see them when we get there.
very well, since the president has come to a decision, i will be in charge of calling a public meeting.
you should go with them. it can only help with your recovery to hear more about your past.
so it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
i don't think that's on the cycrane agenda.
you should still check the expiration date for things like rubbing alcohol. if it's expired, it won't be effective.
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
c'mon, is there nothing left to talk about? in that case, let's all get some water and try to think about something else.
still, if he started from caravan ribat, the chances are that his route took him via aaru village. you may as well ask if anyone there has seen him.
uh you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence
not even that. the lord of the night knows the ley lines better than anyone. i'm sure she knew of your victory before us all.
it is. powerful enough to help you repair the veluriyam mirage, with any luck.
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
indeed. in kafka's words that's also a "missing part" of my life.
i know when danger will come and what form it will take. don't worry, together we can do this -- no harm will come to you.
one rule though -- please don't ask anything boring
"stars hung from its branches" then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
and that memory will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
i am the only one in all of inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
yep. it can be any name you like.
is this treasure really more important to you than bringing peace to the kingdom?
oh, you must be the professional lady guuji hired? i was just wondering why i hadn't seen you yet
trust me, you don't want to know the cost of betraying me. just think of the things i said to you as our little secret. understood?
could we maybe find a peaceful resolution instead? never mind, doesn't matter
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
really? well then, uh, sure maeur"madam faruzan. maybe you could pick out a few fashionable outfits for us.
that's enough fuss for today. you two, take him away. the honorary knight and i have other matters to attend to.
i will say, i never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, clorinde.
little one, the pairings for the remaining thirty-two are out.
hehe i'm sure you're playing it down a little. koutoku and the others put you through your paces, i presume?
come on, i've told you my story aeur" now it's your turn. shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
sure, i'd be happy to do that. i don't have any more time to waste here aeur" i still have other things to do.
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
my, my. yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. i like it very much.
lisa, "humble clerical staff" do not wield electro the way you do.
in theory, that means khaenri'ahn souls shouldn't be drawn to the presence of the night kingdom. something strange is going on
if it's just pain you're afraid of, i might have a solution
no matter what is waiting for us down the line, i will protect everyone especially klee. this is my duty as the acting grand master of the knights of favonius.
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
but soon, the resistance will fall. they are no match for the might of the shogun's army her schemes mean nothing now.
yeah, don't sweat it. the eremites' reputation is gonna get even worse if these scumbags succeed.
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
nor do i think it is any great shame. there is no lack of fine actors or inspirational stories, either on or off the stage.
oh please, do your worst~ i never asked souka to win in the first place. besides, maybe suffering a humiliating defeat will give her the epiphany she so desperately needs.
i thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant memokeeper might have left in your mind. now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.
but given the urgency of the situation, let's just ignore the usual regulations.
alright. if we happen to come across that yaoqing messenger who got away
i appreciate your concerns. i will consider the options carefully and be sure to proceed appropriately.
ganyu has brought me up to speed on everything. i'll get straight to the point.
from before the memory loss, before the express
just as what happened on the xianzhou yaoqing recently.
and now, the wayob have sensed a special surge within the ley lines. a truly ancient soul is about to return to the mortal realm.
well then, let us begin. question one.
there's been no noise, no bright lights, no nothing! i couldn't have asked for anything more!
grandpa always asks me to go look at swords with him, but he hasn't said anything about this one. it's really weird.
the only thing worth saying is: old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
yes, of course. you were frantically flying and dashing about throughout the entire thing. not an elegant sight at all.
could it be a challenge that requires us to use the hand of zagreus? let's get closer and find out.
what are you trying to do, traveler? provoking a god in front of her people?
i'm picking up signals from more puppets somewhere farther in. let's go take a look.
really? so my guess was correct.
we're truly sorry for what happened but this is not the end of the story, right?
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
why don't you skip all this rigmarole and just have a heart-to-heart conversation with me? it might tickle a little.
if you don't say anything now, you may never have another chance!
and we'll all be there for them. our warm, welcoming community will show them the same kindness we were shown in the past.
why do i keep bumping into you? are you stalking me or something?
compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and grants knowledge to the people wait
what do you know? silent but deadly speaks.
hm, even when you put it that way, it still doesn't feel right
simultaneously, it might also strengthen their bonds with phainon and castorice.
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
fancy running into you two again! what a pleasant surprise~
alright, i'll get the paper needed for the lots. give me a moment.
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou
i know! how about a red horned lizard? it's a solitary creature and doesn't require much interaction.
oh come on, lighten up! why so serious with all the quotations and references?
sorry, but it looks like we'll have to put our meteor shower search on hold.
i ask for you to guide us. let us see what you once gazed upon, let us hear what your ears once heard
*sigh* i've had a lot of free time recently, so i was thinking about writing some new songs. sadly, that's about as far as i got
sweet dreams soda?
no, i'm still going to melt down this sword!
this sword in my hand naught but a needle compared with the heavenly bodies. how can i use it to cut open a star?
before ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet
now we just need to find all the malfunctioning robots and retrieve the sculpture pieces one by one.
but be careful not to get launched into the air or frozen while fighting. that would be most unsightly.
hmm, let's leave the slogan to mingxi. we should head to the next location.
the shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. the question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
wait. sorry, ma'am, but i think it could be quite a while before the style you recommended comes back into fashion
ah her? how is this possible?
i honestly have no idea
hmph, you don't look too bright, but it turns out you have a knack for scheming
when i heard the kids at the clinic talking about this "game," i thought they were just making things up again
no one is in any doubt as to the iudex's authority. he always delivers a fair verdict aeur" and when necessary, i will reiterate the fairness of this verdict with my sword.
i command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. rest well tonight.
although they aren't around anymore, they're preserved in our tradition of dance. this outfit i'm wearing is apparently based on how the goddess of flowers looked.
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment)
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
boarding exam? like a test? i can do that! that sounds like the admission system that schools in belobog use!
of course. i've heard that most humans like desserts, so it's not unusual that i should enjoy them too. miko agrees with me on this.
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
that'll give them the chance to take a lot of liberties they can copy any secret texts or steal any treasure they find underground.
i've already concocted some of the medicine in question, but there can't be any further delays. could you assist me in ensuring it arrives on time?
that's an answer i can accept. oleg, what do you think?
a full, complete flight can only be considered as such when it starts with a successful takeoff and ends with a good landing.
i feel i have grown immensely from my travels with you. if, one day, i finally manage to make my dreams a reality i wonder, will you still be there by my side?
it's all my fault -- i've been putting too much on your plate. that's why you looked up ways to manage the pressure...
the victims obviously will have gotten quite a fright, but at least they won't be in any great danger.
why would you suddenly ask a question like that?
does the maritime express run out of constellation metropole?
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while
well, what do you say? aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
not at all, just doing what you asked. how about we call it even as payment for the healer lady's consultation?
now, if you'll excuse me, i'll be leaving now.
the balladeer is no. six of the fatui harbingers. in terms of strength, he is superior to signora.
anyway, sorry for my reaction back there i got a bit too excited when i saw you two
hey did you just scare off a fragmentum monster?
wooow, how dazzling!
you have a very considerate partner. follow me, then.
a long time ago, with the approval of the qixing, a mining team conducted an exploratory excavation there.
let's go, we must try to squeeze some answers out of cirrus.
we're not to use our status or reputation in liyue harbor to our advantage, and we have no starting capital.
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
no. as you just pointed out, that kind of thing is easily replaced.
no, it's not a code. the words are meaningless.
a reasonable request. it is indeed my oversight for failing to tell you everything in time.
thank you for your constant kind words and comfort, traveler.
however, there are still other things we can do. let's keep going.
i don't doubt it, cyno, but this is about more than me and them there's a lot more where they came from.
and you're here now, so even if you're gonna leave eventually, i wanna make sure you at least leave with fond memories.
phew it looks like i still have a long way to go.
so i'll put the points under kaveh's name, then?
all the miners here huddled together anyone else getting deja vu?
but what inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like makoto.
after a long, difficult journey, you finally arrive at the location indicated by your map. it appears to be an ancient site of some sort, where treasure likely awaits.
hmm, alright, maybe this will help.
gratitude won't pay your bills, though don't do this to me, can't we just play by normal business rules here?
and you, my dear benefactors, will be my source of courage.
then who should we blame? the ipc?
the desert is unforgiving, so the way of life here is also a lot tougher than on the other side of the wall. you survive on making connections out here.
he was a famed artist, but he recognized that very few people could connect with his works.
and i hope that you can all witness it with me.
whatever your reasons are, you're planning to take the cursed sword away from the xianzhou! hand it over to me!
thank you for your hard work. if there are any other members who still feel uneasy, please tell them on my behalf that protecting the dreamscape requires everyone's help.
hey! how have your travels been? thanks to you, things are pretty peaceful around here. the chief and i are getting restless!
the suanni that gaming and shuyu made looks very majestic. i'm sure it'll look even more impressive as it soars through the sky.
all kinds of sights: a lush forest after a cooling rain, green pastures and little foxes
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
the model in the sandpit... it's the golden hour, isn't it?
the members of swordfish ii are currently on standby in a valley to the southwest. ronin have been causing trouble down there lately, and we need a special operations unit to eliminate them and stabilize the rearguard.
"stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation" what a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it
it's yanqing's sword -- i saw him wield it one time when i was doing drills with the cloud knights.
that fish one with the misleading name. sounds bland, but it's drowning in hot chilis.
nowadays mengming manages everything in and out of the tea house. people say "foxians are born to do business," but things are always easier said than done.
they're the ones who accept ena's dream and indulge in their happy illusions...
because we need geomarrow. after belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. the eternal freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
i'm surprised the vagrants in the great mine go after the mining teams, they must be desperate.
it wasn't as fun as you think.
in that case, do any of you have experience in hunting?
looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
little layla here breezed through her first battle, souka won hers by a hair's breadth but mine was rather disappointing. my opponent was a frightful bore.
so, even if it seems small to you -- you did a very great thing here.
the next round will be the final one. please rest up before then, everyone.
perhaps the next time we meet, i'll be able to see you in the true sense of the word.
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express one time, just to listen to music?
why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
something small, i suppose. we have to hit the road again after we eat. beyond that, anything goes.
even though you heard we went to handle monsters together, you believed that candace was the only one doing all the real fighting.
nope, but you just reminded me, giovanni wanted me to pass on a message to you both:
the budget is exactly what it's meant to be. it's the necessary amount of funds to properly carry out a task.
however, just like grandpa said, those who excel with the sword will eventually suffer by it.
(a pattern on a stone door that's something master mentioned before)
hmm i wonder if we can find any clues here?
please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. in ancient times, poetry was all the rage. but nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
ah, i see. so in other words, i need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
it's a little bit forced, but it's fine. so who is this mister sampo, then?
we go from here to the end of the path without leaving a speck of abomination behind us. the first one to the end wins.
it's not your average washbasin. this ceremonial vessel belonged to the chrysos heirs and is now my gift to the both of you.
a dog? you can determine their mood just by looking at their wagging tail, right?
what's up, nervous?
er have you ever heard of the marechaussee hunters?
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown
"to dehya" it's a letter for me?
are we missing the forest for the trees here? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
yes. you were the person who came to mind. we may not have spent a great deal of time together but i do place a great deal of trust in you.
well, in my opinion, sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the order is right.
that healer with the odd name and peculiar temperament what was his name again? was it pichu? or kaqiu?
you were so quick. i've only just finished my third dessert.
that was my first time seeing you in battle you've got some moves, don't you? no wonder you were able to save the underworld.
whatever else uncle tian might think of zhiyi, the fact remains that he's one of his favorite students.
it's fine. i don't mind, so long as i can alleviate your suspicions.
the youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music
now please be a good boy and don't move.
well, it seems that your answers have addressed all my questions.
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
oh, sorry if we were a little loud. it's always the way, though aeur" it's like that every time i need to ask pops something.
tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave shingo's body. then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
i was never much of a fighter, and i'm not one for risking my life either. getting diting into your hands is already beyond the realm of my job description.
yes, i'm happy to meet you too. we've met before in the simulated universe.
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
i'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
ahaa~ you just wanna spend as much time as possible with me before i go, right?
that is not a "figurine." it's a statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder. do i make myself clear?
if elder huaiyan accepts the explanation, so do i.
if that's the case, i should thank you for protecting my mentor by exiling her, general.
why are you two always so quiet?
gotta say though, i didn't expect you to go on a whole undercover mission during the few days i was gone. sounds like you were really putting your necks on the line, no?
naturally, since you are the face of that historic event. i intend to make chess pieces for everyone who was involved that day, including myself.
mavuika has accepted her death, remember? for her to let someone else dictate her end, there can be only one possibility
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
i like chatting with silver wolf. she's got a lot of ideas for someone so small.
without that power, it's just a normal dye. but, the color it produces is still quite rare.
neuvillette is a man of his word. if he says he can do something, then he means it.
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
i also want to keep dancing with everyone else.
seriously, though, i think the topics i mentioned are the ones really worth sharing with you.
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst?
you know as well as i do that she's always been like this. why start fretting about it now?
so i am afraid i can't help you.
i can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
a possibility to turn ororon into a vessel for loose souls.
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
we're not entirely sure he said something about "adding an element of mystery to the story."
sure. there's no harm in changing my schedule around once in a while.
never finished it, huh?
well, it looks like everything's finally in order. i suppose it's time to head back?
sorry, i'm not quite sure either ipc tech is pretty complex -- there are some principles i'm still trying to wrap my head around.
mister zubayr has already provided signed copies of all documentation related to our operations. everything is perfectly filled out and valid.
don't worry, this is my treat.
that's why, during this golden soiree she is the dance's centerpiece.
there are so many of them are you sure the fissure only recently opened up?
that won't do. even a survey requires rigorous methodology, let alone an investigation.
the ten-lords commission has specially entrusted judge huohuo with commanding the ghost-hunting squad, so please make sure to follow her lead in all matters related to the heliobi.
but since the three commissions work together to serve the shogun, they have a close relationship. someone from one of the other commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to
nothing in particular. i just thought it would be nice to have a companion.
the sun feels almost as hot as those studio lights i'm in front of all the time good thing there can only be one sun.
actually i want to know too. but as a guest on the express, it would be impolite to touch anything.
your connection to the ley lines looks good i can sense the lord of the night.
you came out here to look for him and remember that friendship, no matter how difficult things got. isn't that right?
amazing, right? and i bet you always say something silly like "rules are made to be broken."
the sea of stars is vast and our journeys are difficult and long. please look after yourself, no matter where you are.
but i'm not very strong physically. are you referring to my quick wits?
you've looked out for me during our travels together these past few days. i'm truly grateful and can't thank you enough.
i'm not the best judge of things but these mirrors
i heard there's a hidden palace deep in the mountains south of stone gate. traditionally, that's believed to be where they retreated for cultivation.
that memory zone meme, it is here as well.
what matters is that i made a brief and inconsequential visit, and your first reaction was to immediately arrange a sizable surveillance operation with myself as the target.
you sure don't miss an opportunity, do you?
not a lot of people out there could've fought the mara-struck like you did. i'm only a civil servant -- i can't imagine what kafka would do to me if i were caught in the fray
my audience likes getting to the bottom of mysteries, secrets, and conspiracies we streamers have to cater to that, you know?
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
ah, #nine hundred eighty-eight. the pride of my creations!
that's all of them. please wrap them up for me.
there's nothing to worry about. we just need to go through the schedule you made and tick the items off one by one.
that's the only way to ensure that we have a fair fight, don't you think? i don't want to see you go and lose to someone else, after all.
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
aside from the delivery of performances, isn't this another reason for zubayr theater's continued existence?
finally, if you still think you can copy the fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment
speaking of attracting attention how do we get a following on a paranormal activity website? sounds like little gui's department -- she used me in some of her performances just to draw a bigger crowd.
i've only smelled something this sweet and enticing once, when i was little.
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
and i wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. all we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. or just explain it away as a dream.
mister svarog scanned the robots for irregularities, but the results all came back normal.
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be it doesn't seem to have any info on it
you mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. otherwise you will be cursed with bad luck.
things in the city and on cyno's side are both going well. the guards that stormed out of the akademiya are all taken care of.
ah, now your questions are making me hungry.
we've heard about a certain zhiyi who's been selling fresh fish at low prices in this area recently. do you know anything about this?
ha, it's you three! come on in! i was just talking to clara about you.
cut that out! those weird noises make me seem like i've got a few screws loose. put that little thief to sleep for now. we can decide her fate later.
phainon's words have convinced me to make an exception for you. whether you stay or go after this is for you to decide.
i've seen some strange things here, too. objects that shouldn't be here, strange figures appearing then vanishing i don't think any of it's real.
all three from the yaoqing are critically injured, but fortunately, the xianzhou luofu has a miraculous healer lady. it's a silver lining in this misfortune.
go on. open it up, show me what's inside.
consuming it will make your body light, agile, and promote longevity and well-being. as a nameless, it'll make your journey a much less arduous one.
of course i don't. there is no need for commerce in the plane of euthymia. if i ever need something, i can simply have one of the commissions bring it to me.
the vision hunt decree is a trap. part of a fatui plot to bring inazuma to its knees.
this reminds me of a story that a retainer once told me several years ago.
a director is a kind of job. the one we're looking for is named zosimos.
not right now, since this meteor shower was originally something like a family legend.
oh, we should probably give these props back, right? i'll just leave mine here.
leyla's parents gave me the address of the camp, so i went and checked it out. there were clear traces of spiritual energy, and also look what i found.
the ever-flame mansion has set out on a journey. those poor people they have no idea what lies in wait ahead of them.
so you'll stay and keep her company, yes? don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
a letter that guides us to activate mechanisms on a deserted archipelago it's bizarre.
why? it's not like i'm here to cause trouble. let's just relax.
hah. what an alliance joke.
this stool is a piece of evidence, right?
i came here today to support you as the head of the homayani family. no warning will change my stance on that.
when i first arrived in liyue harbor, i passed by a large house, and felt a chill go down my spine. so i made a rattan figure, and gave it to the young master there.
should we really be charging over there? even without a heliobus, yanqing is a swordsmaster among swordsmasters.
the preparations were very lengthy this time. i don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but i, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
with some suspicion, the captain allows you to survey his condition after you announce yourself as a trained doctor.
my, my, who have we here?
what are you waiting for? we won't hear anything at this rate.
if he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. he'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what i mean.
one side will play the guardians of liyue harbor. the other side will play the fatui and osial.
we've known each other for some time now. she's a pretty interesting person. even though she's an extremely strong warrior, she never misuses her power against others.
chief oleg he didn't say much, but i know he's not the kind to wear his heart on his sleeve.
if you wanna make sure you don't burn yourself out or stifle your creativity, then don't push yourself too hard at work~
if only there was some kind of mysterious potion that could keep me awake forever i need to have a talk with lisa tomorrow.
at that time, i dreamed that one day the jade chamber's shadow would be seen in all seven nations of teyvat.
the ipc does have more capital on hand, but the review criteria are not solely focused on financial resources.
fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. to resist the invasion, the architects had no choice but to redeploy the guards to the front line.
prey will usually rest on rainy days. but not the hunter.
hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. you can most definitely afford it they're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. you have quite the generous payment due.
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
i didn't get a wink of sleep last night.
are you familiar with perfumery? making perfumes is just like dealing with people -- only when the top, middle, and base notes are in perfect harmony can one create a good fragrance.
wow, that's really nice of you!
sea gazer. i believe you're familiar with the name?
and now you get to stake a claim. hmph, you think you're stronger because you got to them first? ugh mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
i finished all my assignments early today. oaeur"overtime? i understand. i'll get right on the case.
joel probably hasn't spent much of his life in the city.
please excuse me for a moment. i think i'll leave the gift in her abode.
to prevent its resurgence, i made some minor modifications to your body -- or more specifically, your tail.
i'll take you over to the location now. i should warn you that i haven't been there myself yet, so i'm not sure how dangerous things could get
sometimes i feel that terms like "genius" were originally created for albedo.
looks like we're not the only ones who wanted afternoon tea today though. we'll have to stand up for the time being.
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
remember, train hard and relish every moment! the title awaits you!
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
i wonder if you've ever heard of a creature called a "heliobus"? it loves to feed on human emotions and memories, and excels at manipulating its hosts.
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
the strategic investment department comprises the ipc's most elite employees, many of whom can be very forceful.
is this the friend that you mentioned? luka? pleased to finally meet you. i keep seeing you in the news! my name is qingque, a diviner from the divination commission.
although we've been through so much together, i actually know very little about the astral express. i'd like to start visiting more frequently if the opportunity arises.
that being said, why did you decide to come back into this mess? dealing with heliobi isn't an easy task
i've watched every one of her matches. she constantly adapts her strategy, and excels at employing rare and unusual tactics.
do not underestimate the enemy. hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. the advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
well are those who rise in the early morn, while those late to bed i shall forewarn~
thanks. hope to see you again soon.
so, you want to see me cry? that might be a little difficult. a show of anger, though that might be something i could accomplish.
he's the reincarnation of imbibitor lunae, and the person behind him is the newest member of the crew. i've heard a lot about you.
lucky for you, i just finished editing my stream -- it's all the proof you need
this transcript records what you asked capote to help you with. here we can see a bossy manager and you being asked to do things outside of your job description.
let's go somewhere the akademiya can't find us and perform there ahh, but how do we let everyone know and what about the atmosphere and the stage
nobody sets off a firework to feel lonely, do they
looks like it's over already.
neuvillette is not the type to take much time off. taking even a half-day for himself is already a huge step in the right direction.
that was really risky behavior! if those grownups had woken up, things could have gotten really dangerous for you two.
don't worry, i wasn't angry. i was just trying to distract her.
(i thought i might stammer, but thankfully, i was able to convey my thoughts just fine. okay, and next)
