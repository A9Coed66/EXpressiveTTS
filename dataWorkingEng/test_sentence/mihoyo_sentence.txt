the guards have opened up a way through for us, we can't let them down.
it doesn't matter which side you choose, miss lingsha. at the end of the day, both you and i stand on the side of the alliance, don't we? let's keep going.
actually, i'm well aware of my own limits. if it weren't for yanqing resisting that heliobus, maybe i wouldn't have been able to hold on until you brought reinforcements.
i've heard his name. a genius boy, and working every day at such a young age? sounds exhausting.
have you seen him compete? a lot of underworlders made a lot of money off that kid! *sigh* your pal sampo here wasn't one of them
my fear of the unknown may be a weakness, but your presence has shown me that surprises aren't always bad.
himeko and mister yang and who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
so, even if it seems small to you -- you did a very great thing here.
because of the crossover meal deals, the alley has seen an uptick in customers.
don't worry, diviner fu seems confident about getting kafka to talk. if i were you i'd just sit back and watch her do her thing.
no? that won't do
i've been waiting for you here for quite a while.
now's not the time -- there's still more to learn. if i lose to someone on the luofu, it doesn't matter, but if i lose to an outsider, it would disgrace the general.
i recognize that woman -- that's elaine from first mining team! quick, let's get up there and see if she's wounded.
not necessarily. there'd usually be a base with supporting forces set up after a successful engagement, but we don't see any of that.
every life has its limit. even the aeons are not truly immortal and will eventually reach the end of their lives.
is it so unthinkable? there are many stories about fallen aeons.
in that sense, the astral express's role in his plans would be imperative. in the worst case scenario he may use us to do something unexpected.
my little sister has a peculiar streak. no, no, i don't mean a bad temper *sigh* let's just say she reminds me more of serval than me.
the tuskpir is a creature that subsists on memoria. hugging it while you fall asleep can raise your sleep quality, treat insomnia, and relieve anxiety and depression.
the way i see it, "operating in secret" and "exposing the paranormal" go hand-in-hand.
okay, second question. what are you most proud of about yourself?
i know what you're thinking, but alas that girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
don't worry, there's enough to go around! on the house -- order whatever you like.
because we need geomarrow. after belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. the eternal freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
if our opponents were martial arts types, i could hold my own against them but aurum alley's problems aren't something we can fight off with a sword.
hm this doesn't look right.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but
when you find a moment, do come back to belobog to have a chat. the silvermane guards will always welcome you.
seele works for them -- oleg's most trusted lieutenant. *sigh* to her i'm probably just, uh, wildfire's lapdog.
should misfortune befall you, do not hesitate to call upon me. i will protect you.
shards of a cloud knight's weapon. something really sharp caused this
oh, you probably haven't met him yet. in short, he's a top-tier fighter in the underworld. he was also doing work for wildfire before, just not in this town.
unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...
his being yet again demonstrates that there are those who, despite being offered countless choices, will always choose the same path.
where's that prankster? haven't the hounds caught him yet?
no, no, no gepard is a captain of the silvermane guards, just like how the luofu has its own cloud knights captains. i have no idea what he's doing running security at a hotel like this though.
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
"moon rage" isn't so much a disease as it is my past and future. one can let go of the past, but must always face the future.
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
did dan feng fight alongside you?
besides, i genuinely like the job of an intelligence officer -- for me, using my brain is a lot more fun than traveling.
seems like the rumors are true. the emanators of the remembrance don't have a physical body and only those they allow can see them.
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
until our next meeting. may my songs gift you with pleasant dreams.
the next angle is what the victims have in common -- distasteful as that discussion may be.
i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go
we can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. but you're more attuned to it than i am.
i didn't expect to see you here, miss robin.
well, the competition for survival went two ways -- shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom, and failure to take proper precautions cost many a hunter their life.
i am the general of the luofu. there are things that i wish i did not have to do, and yet i must.
i shall remain here, gazing from afar as you bask in the limelight, joining the audience in offering you the most heartfelt cheers and applause.
what will happen if you press it? hasn't anyone actually tried?
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
i didn't plan anything. it was the future. we interfere on countless future possibilities and make the best future a reality.
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
i see. no wonder those assistananas only want to teach students one on one
all i remember is that this is a good place to while away the days~ still, many delves have changed beyond recognition since the arrival of the stellaron.
natasha's right, we should make sure those children are alright.
i just did what i had to do. you are special, after all so special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
it's for your own good, little yunli. while you desire to compete against each other, i don't want to see either of you getting hurt.
in danger? what do you mean?
the righteous heroes of the hunt would never hijack the astral express.
in other words, something big must have happened in fyxestroll garden for them to show up.
jiaoqiu always said i'm the most impatient person among the cloud knights, and i can't argue with that. so there's no reason for you to be more anxious than me.
why don't we flip the question and start by asking who couldn't be the murderer? after all, there are only three suspects, so elimination could be a valid method.
pretty clear, although you seem to have changed the order in the jarilo case.
ah, speaking of which actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
i suppose it all depends on how you see his understanding of and devotion to the beauty.
there's a saying -- the more demanding the diner, the stronger the skills of the chef but no matter what others say, i'll always be demanding more from myself.
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
on the other hand, the entire crew of the astral express seems to be extraordinarily skilled.
also, if we can leverage this opportunity to establish an amicable exchange with the xianzhou alliance, it may provide us with more bargaining power when dealing with the ipc.
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express one time, just to listen to music?
mm-hmm, that is indeed an important aspect of your identity. a very honest answer.
from there, you can glimpse the stars that lie at the very edge of the horizon.
but the fireworks
and look at these! how unusual they don't appear to have been left by a human
how did the infiltrators learn about the location where hoolay was held? and how did they time their plan just before the yaoqing messengers were ready to escort him?
ah! so that's how it is, no wonder i haven't heard from bronya is she alright?
if we walk through here, we'll be able to see the wardance's official venue.
i never thought i'd hear that word again after being expelled by the architects come on, i'll tell you everything.
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
thank you for your patience, mister alfalfa. let's continue our discussion.
it is not my intention to provoke you. perhaps as assurance, we can have my friend here perform the task in my stead. wonweek has a higher mastery of the harmony than i do.
i understand. from your point of view, i can see how unreasonable it appears.
making excuses for being late like it's no big deal? if you worked under me, i'd personally make you regret it.
i'll give that poor flying sword some proper maintenance. i won't consider returning the sword unless he learns how to say "please," "hello," "thank you," and "sorry."
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
let me guess limited range? energy costs?
funnily enough, that was a part of our conversation
what i saw surprised me a good number of the architects in belobog believe that qlipoth is the one and only aeon it's clear that their conclusion was limited and lacking in perspective.
i guess that's what it means literally.
if you're interested in going sometime, we could ask pela to come too. it'll be just like the camping trip
well, all the pictures will be shot in the alley. so there you go.
let's get to bed early and save our energy. i sense the next few days could be tiring.
it was clearly you who went off on your own.
let's go then. we need to find something, even if we have to search every corner of this market.
after all, how can i know which answer is which?
i wouldn't say so, i'll be counting on a few friends for support.
turns out the astral express crew is more fun than i expected! you liked it? really? haha, told you so!
it might be possible to use another heliobus to drive out the one that seized huohuo's mind.
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
since no one's around to entertain us, let's make ourselves at home. stay close to me so that my "white" can cover you, too.
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
i have no questions about the case, but i'm just curious how did sparkle manipulate you?
shouldn't we ring the harmonic chime and see if we can talk to yanqing inside the illusion?
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
oddly specific, march
that shouldn't be necessary... but if it makes the nameless feel less defensive, i'll be happy to abide.
what do these people really need when they have lost everything? guidance of the wise? or aid from the strong?
a whole generation has grown up in the underworld in the last decade or so, and they never had the privilege of seeing these precious works of art and historical treasures what you've done has helped bridge a huge gap for them.
be it my duties as her heir, or a silvermane guard, i must face my problems head-on. even if
"against the scorching sun, a beautiful flower will never endure. within my fair embrace, my love for you is tender and pure."
it didn't seem to make much difference though. still, at least we can understand what he's saying i'll leave him alone for now.
or i can just give you the mastery mark, up to you.
you said external forces might be messing with my head, right? that just makes me more curious. hmph, no one gets away with locking up my memories! let's go. i'll show you the way to goethe hotel!
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath
are we just supposed to abandon those "less likely" locations?
hmph, we've not even drawn swords yet and you declare yourself the winner? let me offer you a word of advice -- don't underestimate me.
in any case, you can deliver her directly to us. once we learn something, i will share every piece of information with you.
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
hmm i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
with this mask on, i intend to keep the world at bay.
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
i don't know. galaxy rangers always work alone, but i don't think boothill will do anything that is detrimental to the express.
my other senses make up for that fact to some extent -- they're as strong as anyone else's.
i see that you've recovered the lifeform in the master control zone. thank you, well done.
tsk, trying to worm your way in again, huh? but you won't be able to establish a connection if you know nothing about slumbernana monkey~
i take back what i said. we have to hurry to that memory zone where miss firefly's presence was imprinted. considering what this person can do
if it weren't for you, i wouldn't have had any idea about the hardships people were going through in the underworld. it made me feel like maybe i could help a little, and make belobog a better place.
the reverie hotel's bellboy how did he end up here? and right after miss acheron severed the beautiful dream
my old friend, your call for help back then has been answered. luka is the answer.
impossible! even if there are still undercover borisin that we haven't sniffed out, hoolay can't have more than a few dozen people. how is he planning on simultaneously attacking the streets of the xianzhou luofu?
we can't always face problems alone and build walls to keep people out we need to learn to rely on others -- especially those we care about the most.
nameless ninjas? are you talking about the nameless? we have names, you know. i'm march seventh and he's dan heng.
you never know what unexpected troubles could arise.
and before you say anything, there will be a next time. i know we'll meet again.
how observant! you're right, i'm not a xianzhou native~
my lady, i did speak to professor capote, and i did ask him some things.
...assignments like those were okay before the invasion, but now i need to focus on clearing out any last traces of the legion.
the vast starry sky, the billions of cute, magical critters even if only for them, i've gotta work hard.
just me? why can't we just talk here?
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
"unlikely, potential" meaning there could still be conflicts
but let me make it clear: the alliance sent me here to handle the business impartially, not to choose sides.
she was kind to me though. when she went to the space station, i followed her.
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
while a cursed sword grants instant abilities to its wielder, it comes at a cost.
because of that exciting match earlier, and also because you're the second wardance contestant from jarilo in the past seven hundred years.
a newcomer with the cloud knights? *sigh* just go back to where she's from. everything is so competitive here in the luofu. you can't get promoted.
remember when i mentioned that the cloud knights blocked all relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing happened? stargazer navalia is not under lockdown.
long the permanence, idrila the beauty, ena the order, tayzzyronth the propagation akivili the trailblaze.
i once felt regret for those that were lost without a trace, but fortunately, we were later able to sense, discover, and preserve them.
the pegs. i forgot to mention -- thick snow needs leaded iron pegs.
well, that's more like it. just be careful, because i'm not as easy to handle as the borisin.
we heard that mister xiao proposed to "reorganize" the merchant guild, and we wanted to ask why.
h--hey! i'm not always like this! it's all because of that cursed sword
the dock workers are always yelling "lay 'em out!" before stocking the merchandise. it scares me to death every time.
that was some impressive cloud knight spearmanship. which unit are you from?
*sigh* if i didn't have to worry about nutrition, i'd be ordering cosmic fried rice every meal
i'll explain later. let's get moving.
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
ya sure got some daydreams on ya, little one.
and trial two will be complete.
why are you getting so skinny these days? shall we eat to live, or live to eat? i know, let's go for some hot pot.
the president is still a hero to aurum alley -- he helped it achieve prosperity but a hero will not be embraced forever.
i knew it no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
a starskiff to get us out of the luofu. the borisin we discovered at stargazer navalia were actually preparing a vessel for their escape.
it's hard to imagine such contrasting personalities working in perfect harmony as i mentioned, the campaign inflicted heavy losses on the xianzhou air force
it follows that the alliance's marshal and six generals are in no way inferior to lord ravagers.
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
seriously, who lights a green lantern in their house? those guys must be nuts.
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "the stone heart of a ninja is immune to pressure, immune to lies, come wind, rain, or shine."
i helped set the underlying mechanisms for this type of gear bridge. it's controlled via different terminals in combination. let's go find them.
see! that was easy.
looks like we won't be able to convince each other. now that our conflict has been destined, let's unveil our paths and reveal to the universe the true path.
sure, do what you need to. come back when you're ready.
hesitation never did anyone any good.
great! starting tomorrow, yanqing and yunli will teach you the basics of the cloud knights' swordplay.
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea. anyway, i'm getting off-track, i won't take any more of your time. good luck.
mm, you should take this opportunity to enjoy the rest of the tournament -- no need to rush to a decision now.
let's play truth and lies!
i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
i wish to express my gratitude for the invitation to the express.
you made it sound like you were talking to those kids but you were talking to me.
a correct observation, if i may add.
that's right, but don't worry, this isn't a trial. i just want to have a chat with you and get a better understanding of the facts.
it seems like someone has been awaiting us. ready to step into the spotlight now?
ah i apologize. please, continue.
do you want to leave? then do it now.
however, dan feng's ritual failed, and his powers remained within me and yet for some reason, it also created you.
got it. but it sounds like mister assistant detective has his own misgivings would you like to go over it again?
you aren't getting any funny ideas, are you?
are you saying that humans will suffer the same fate?
well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, of course. wildfire has no reason to help you yet, so we'll just have to give them one! with your talents, we have nothing to worry about.
let's go. once this stage play concludes it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
there was a gravitational shift. the same thing happens when we warp jump, only we feel heavier.
i've heard there are serious incidents unfolding on the luofu. communication with the divination commission's delve has been severed. for your own safety, i'd suggest you remain here.
it really does have a tracking function let's see how useful it is.
essentially, the dream of penacony is a world formed by memoria. only by fully understanding its nature can you move freely within it.
oh? you look fine to me. sorry, i need to prioritize the wounded. there have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days -- many people are injured.
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
sister, don't be angry. most of your time is spent in the field -- you're not accustomed to dealing with others. leave this to me. if i explain the reasoning, they will leave.
"the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen"...
please consider my plans carefully, supreme guardian. if jarilo-vi wants to rebuild its connections with the rest of the galaxy, your credit record with the ipc will be of great importance.
maybe igor even attended the wardance. the xianzhou people have long lives, so it wouldn't be something that happened long ago for them.
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully
the belobogians have always lived under difficult conditions. we children already knew our path forward long ago.
looks like the rumors were right -- "death" does seem to be targeting random victims. and based on sunday's notes he's no stranger to "death."
it's fine. do as they ask, and try to avoid any conflicts with the family report to me before taking any action. mhm. yes, alright.
you can be our referee, seele! you know the rules of the club inside out.
it's got a small base, but it's stable enough to get the job done. i used to love stargazing with it when i was a child.
well, i'm glad we managed to talk this out.
haha, the enthusiasm is cute, but don't think just because you're still figuring out the game that pela and i will take it easy on you!
and so the hero of the xianzhou became its arch-villain.
how are things going lately? work is not going well, as usual. i envy the nameless of the express, as they can come and go as they please.
since lady asta sent you to look for me, i assume she must've given you the encryption key for accessing the elevator system?
precisely. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
i'm fine, a quick patching up will do. thanks for asking. i'll report the situation to lead researcher asta immediately. bye.
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already
luka, you've always had this bad habit of taking a hit to exploit a weakness, but gepard's much stronger than you, so remember, stay away from his punches.
"guessed?" so, you don't have any evidence
or maybe you ugh, what kind of hotel is this, anyway? no peepholes on the doors?
uh, let me ask you one more question do you know the person in the coffin?
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
i feel like some of you aren't convinced by the whole online ghost-hunting thing how about this -- we take a look at the leads we have so far, and pick one to try out as a test run.
come on. can't you read the room? something is definitely off about the three people we just met.
(i'm not sure pom-pom is the best casting choice for a gang boss)
i don't want that to happen. if you guys really believe that you can convince mister svarog then i need to be brave too.
that name sounds familiar oh! one time when i went to uncle j's house, i saw someone hiding on the roof maybe it was him!
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
i have to remind you that sparkle is a masked fool. do you plan on finding logic in the mind of a masked fool?
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
is this lady your friend too?
fantastic, miss guinaifen. i'll be on my way, now. stay safe, everyone.
just enter the command into the device. the vessel used to cultivate starskiff seeds will be activated, and a ship will appear in the skyport soon after.
i was concerned about the safety of my companions, so i acted brazenly. i admit i was reckless at that time, but
yes, i grew up here, listening to the sound of waves while researching prescriptions with my mentors and peers at the alchemy commission.
ohhh, i've met them, alright. one time, i wore a weeping mask and snuck into their troupe.
this is also a lovely answer.
charmony bananadvisor is bound to slip up like the others. exercise caution.
but since you know about the stellaron and have stated that you want to help the luofu, i thought i should at least meet you in person
did she get rid of me on purpose
this norbert guy, do you know what his line of work was?
whenever i am in your vicinity, i sense a sort of power. could it be you have a stellaron in your possession?
i heard the healer lady is capable of curing all diseases. i'm here for the same reason anyone would be -- for a check-up and consultation.
my stay in exalting sanctum was supposed to be focused on treating people and delivering medicine, but the seat of divine foresight tasked me with analyzing the prescription i've been severely delayed.
makes sense. we went crazy and couldn't control ourselves i like the way you think.
when the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
luocha already saw the control panel -- why is it taking this long to find it
it might mean the tables have turned.
that was my final question, thank you. we all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here i believe it's about penacony's past.
m--my friends, don't just stand there! this drama really doesn't need any more bystanders!
i asked all about what the express was made of, but his answers were super short.
and much of that is thanks to all of you.
don't be rude, yunli! apologize to our esteemed guests from afar!
is there anything left to do? we're meeting the guardian tomorrow. there won't be any time for sightseeing.
not everyone can move beyond their past. but once a person comes out of the fog, their stride will undoubtedly become more resolute.
given our limited life spans, the only ones who place value on ceremony are us foxians.
look, a solitary chain. go say hello to it.
it doesn't seem to be technology from here. look -- it even has an interastral peace corporation logo on it.
then who should we blame? the ipc?
"the peerless boulder champion"
the vagrants had no choice but to ask mister svarog to look into it, but he still hasn't found anything i investigated the matter myself, but i came up empty-handed
simply put, my friend, i need your help. you may or may not know this, but penacony's far murkier than it seems. the family's eyes are everywhere, but you get the drift.
every child in belobog should visit this exhibit at least once no, once isn't nearly enough.
that's true, but what's your plan? did you conceal an orbital support beacon in that gift money bag?
they'll be okay now. you should head back to the bridge too -- the guards and wildfire have set up a safe zone there.
when the cancer of all worlds broke out, the ipc lost control of penacony, and the planet sought refuge under xipe the harmony. now it's a member of "the family."
yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
lingsha, as always, you're still an expert in making unpaid work sound so noble and grand
you don't look so tough yourself. well, let's find her. svarog's not going anywhere.
it was a deliberate display to showcase the dangerous nature of the "cargo" in broad daylight. this way, the cargo would end up in the shackling prison, serving as a tool for the prison break.
it took me a while to realize i was letting the whole thing stress me out -- i couldn't think straight. when i set foot on the express and saw how vast the universe is, i started to feel calm and relaxed.
i feel like going back to reality and resting too come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
hahaha, okay, i'll stop. anyway, that's what luka's like. he forgets about himself once he's in the mood.
the footprints here are different from the rest there are two sets of them. looks like an outsider might have passed through here not long ago.
hello. none of you seem surprised by my arrival.
he promoted helm master yukong himself -- he probably knows more about her past than anyone.
since you're here can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
it feels surreal that everything worked out for the alley.
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
my apologies. i forgot that you're not very tall.
but since we're already here, they could use our help.
oh and when did you become convinced?
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
that's a romantic way of putting it, but i suspect the reality could be more sinister
just swallow it already. hoolay is like all borisin, he can release a pheromone called lupitoxin that induces fear.
do try to think for yourself.
yes, indeed. however, cuteness is but one of many admirable attributes.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
i, too have embarked on journeys, encountering "old friends" with familiar faces on different worlds, witnessing their destinies follow paths similar to mine. so, i will tell you...
i know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
*sigh* alright! to prove my sincerity, i'll introduce you to wildfire. if you're looking for something down here, they're the ones to ask!
in the golden era you described, the old aurum alley had a trading volume similar to today.
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
while we still don't know what this legacy entails, it's only a matter of time before the power struggle ensnares innocent bystanders.
i'm happy for you, serval it's not easy to truly put the past behind you.
hello, what brings you two here? the wind and waves are restless around lunarescent depths today.
ninja initiate gigaku, what ails you?
metaphorically speaking, they are like moths to a flame but that flame is the thoughts of sentient beings.
i've got more than a dozen siblings! one of them is my older brother -- he's also living on the xianzhou. his name is langshile, but he seems to prefer being called "lancelot."
a regular customer? you?
miss march seventh! have you taken the time to consider my suggestion?
huh, chatting with you seems to have lightened my mood. it seems like talking can really raise one's spirits.
the answer is simple: it's because the assistant detective is the murderer.
judges are instructed by the ten lords to carry out their orders, but no one ever explains their meaning to us
...she's actually an emanator, who brings death and finality.
(speaking of which, when did i turn into an aurumaton?)
each questioner had good intentions, but the road to catastrophe is paved with good intentions.
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
my brain must be filling in the blanks probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
please, ask away. i welcome all forms of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge.
sure enough the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
however, objectively speaking, since belobog has existed as an independent entity to this day, its debt cannot simply be written off.
looks like this is one exceptional passenger. don't you have to accompany her then, miss himeko?
hehe, this is a pretty big ask~
still, that doesn't help us much. the ship is huge, with changing conditions across various delves. i'm sure there were showers across many of them at the time.
sometimes i get hit by sudden hunches that a great film is in the making. more often than not, these tend to be just scenes from different groups of people that are then edited together.
it's a present. of course it's gotta look the part.
by "passenger," do you mean this lady here?
still, none of the coffee they drink has the same aroma as himeko's brew. she must have a few secret ingredients up her sleeve.
i hope that one day, we will have the chance to meet on the racetrack.
every reunion is also a new encounter. hello, i am "sunday," a humble passenger.
so, uh a sweetheart?
when did svarog start doing his calculations, clara?
it is a planet made of data and symbols. the edges of reality and illusion are blurred in punklorde, as are its days and nights.
more good luck, i suppose. but it's not as cushy as you think -- scurrying from one side of the galaxy to the other, going wherever businesses require me to be
what else is there to say? you know him as well as i do. he's an upstanding guy, as well as young, handsome, and charming in his lack of charm.
when i left the train, i only had time to say a quick goodbye to himeko.
hee-hee, i like your sense of humor, benefactors. of course i'm happy to see you! when things settle down, i might even get promoted for catching a stellaron hunter.
now only one question remains why would cocolia exhibit such a sudden change in her attitude towards us?
i have no mechanism for "fear." there's an empty space in my mind and my heart, but i'm unable to perceive it. changing that part of myself isn't something i can do alone.
we're not entirely sure he said something about "adding an element of mystery to the story."
hello, edward. i'd like my friends to try something fun, if you know what i mean.
miss thunderbolt is such a thoughtful person! thank you so much.
...first, don't you want to know my name?
indeed, your counsel has always been of great help to me. you may use your discretion on the matters ahead of us.
ahem, but don't tell lead researcher asta what i just said.
here we are again, pal!
don't try to cause a rift between us. every move and technique i taught march is straight from the zhuming art of swordplay.
i always take doctor jiaoqiu's sensational stories with a grain of salt some people like to call him a weirdo, but the truth is he's experienced a lot of things that i couldn't even imagine
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
yes -- more accurately, my personal training plan.
i knew you'd come around. on the xianzhou you're the only person i can turn to for help.
my only wish is to get acquainted with the supreme guardian-to-be. any introduction will do -- even a painful one!
it is an unspoken rule of the knights of beauty that the commandment is uttered before a battle between knights. i apologize.
a world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the garden of recollection
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
but why did little gui have to get dragged into this? this mission is too dangerous for a civilian!
come find me once you've done what you're here to do.
i... th--those guys aren't serious when they refer to me like that, y'know. anyway, please don't start using it yourself too...
quick, back to the energy supply hub. anyone that tries to stop us is gonna find out a thing or two.
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract goes against everything the nameless are about.
what an amazing display of skill! you've rightfully earned the title of "champions!"
(doesn't sound like any of the "luochas" i came across)
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
you're overthinking it, jing yuan. as i said, i'm here to broaden my granddaughter's horizons. i have no ulterior motives.
the light of the aventurine stone has disappeared.
that's how outsiders refer to my peers in the zhuming cloud knights and the artisanship commission.
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
is that so? well, before you leave, i recommend listening to mister xiyan's legend of the high-cloud quintet.
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination
don't worry! this isn't going to involve anything illegal!
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
such a rudimentary lock. easy pickings.
really? after listening to dan heng, i assumed you all liked it
hahaha, thank you for the reminder, but i don't think that will be necessary. when she's at the table, it's the others who need to be cautious.
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
as the fragmentum spreads underground, more monsters go roaming around causing trouble for all the towns. that means more vagrants in the mines.
with the front line on high alert, they must have rotated the bridge to make it impassable. then they cut off the energy supply to the terminals to avoid accidental repositioning or to prevent deserters from escaping.
here for a show and here for the day, but bring your wallet 'cause you get what you pay~
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
don't worry. there aren't many people out there with that kind of talent. it shouldn't be too hard to find her.
you can't even imagine the atmosphere there -- even someone as heartless as me got the chills! i only stayed for a day before i couldn't take it anymore and slipped away.
i apologize for taking up everyone's precious time, and we shan't keep you any longer. if you need anything else while in penacony, the family stands ready to serve.
we were once adversaries, but his steadfast will and unwavering beliefs deserve my utmost respect.
looks like we'll have to play this little game of sparkle's then.
a "guardian of humanity" that can command robots? i've never heard of anything like
um, if you don't mind i still have important things to do. i'll go back now.
it really isn't worth going into.
indeed it was. we're lucky to have an experienced fighter like you who can adapt to different enemies.
she should be just over there, playing some game with other diviners.
the wheels are completely broken, but the connecting component should be pretty much okay. let's remove it.
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
you think that man is not actually "living", but that's not quite accurate. even without penacony, people create their own illusions called "self-value."
everyone expected my life to change after going through something huge like that.
the timescale of dreamflux reef differs from reality, so we mustn't lower our guard. you're sensitive to memoria -- a slight misstep, and you could get lost in this memory zone.
hmm i get it. looks like all the kids on the luofu live tough lives. so, how about you, miss yunli?
ah, that's right. since the legion's invasion, lady asta's been procuring defense products customized to the station's needs. i think she's already got platinum membership cards with some of the suppliers...
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
i was wondering why he didn't come and see me after the championship match ended. come, tell me about it.
i didn't intend to keep his sword. i was planning to take this chance to return it to him, but now i've changed my mind.
rule number seven: never leave a footprint. i have my own special technique called "invisible snow-walking." helps me throw off pursuers in notime
before i left, destiny's slave told me that this journey would bring unforgettable rewards. even though the script he gave me only had a few lines, i couldn't ignore them.
how quaint. a space so meticulously curated just for my refined tastes. i suppose it might do for moments of reflection.
fyreflies are such magical creatures, aren't they? they may throw themselves at a flame or suddenly grow old, but every night before that, they will shine brighter than the stars.
looks like they're planning to escape on the skiffs in stargazer navalia.
then for now i will excuse myself. qingni's irresponsible actions caused much trouble for the two of you -- allow me to apologize once again on her behalf.
at the time i was in such a hurry that i didn't hear the whole mystery. i tentatively speculated that the murderer had killed the victim the night before, but hadn't locked the door from the inside.
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
it's getting late, let's get ready to move. is there something else you wanted to talk about?
to make sure these ten boxes fit within one another, i had to meticulously measure them -- it would've been a bust if i was off by even one millimeter!
stargazer navalia is governed by the artisanship commission -- it took me a while to sort out our paperwork. i got a sense of the situation on my way back.
the cloud knights will have been alerted by now -- i need to hurry to the dock.
hmph, listen to her. "what is the meaning of this?" she still thinks she's an overworld princess.
that's just the work of my subconscious mind
the old me? i used to be a knight of beauty.
but in my opinion, akivili's fall holds significance for the nameless.
that's an answer i can accept. oleg, what do you think?
he passed out. his intense negative emotions attracted the nearby memory zone memes.
ahem, i wouldn't advise it. violence wouldn't make for a very interesting outcome now, would it?
even though my apprentice has learned a thing or two, as a master, i can't stop worrying!
this mural must be related to the others here. it tells the story of the vidyadhara self-reincarnation, from hatching rebirth in the ancient sea, to the return to that same sea as the cycle begins again.
one slogan to end them all.
i am not who you think i am, nor will my home be as fortunate as your world.
i know that, gepard. don't worry, i've thought this one through for a change.
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
jepella brotherhood... i've heard that name somewhere...
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur
ask away, my friend. i have all the answers you seek.
i haven't really worked with boss svarog before, so please, lead the way. let's go!
sometimes i wonder whether your head's screwed on right. we need to take you to the alchemy commission for a check-up.
mister svarog scanned the robots for irregularities, but the results all came back normal.
y'know, you're getting less silent and more deadly by the minute! sounds good, let's get it!
absolutely. the three steps of negotiation: listen, test, and strike. that's what you taught me.
you're making me blush i lost so badly it didn't really seem "beautiful" at all.
if it was a gift why was it in madam cocolia's office?
luka's opponents usually don't last long, hahaha. go!
it seems our every meeting is accompanied by an incident of some sort. i hope i can meet the astral express crew under better circumstances next time.
actually, some of the cloud knights use pellets which contain trace amounts of this ingredient. when you block pain on the battlefield, you have a better chance of beating your opponent and surviving.
do you actually believe in the stellaron hunters' prophecy?
hmph so this is how it is.
patience is a virtue. however, i won't hold it against you. on the contrary, i'm here to make my intentions clear.
but because of this, i believe that you will make the right decision -- a decision that will truly benefit your people.
oh! c'mon, my dear fellow, i thought we weren't going to discuss this? i beg you, the fewer rumors there are about me, the better!
i plan to entrust the alley to you two. if you ever need any help, just ask the president.
indeed, he was particularly concerned about that galaxy ranger.
ready? my stomach's always ready for food and drink!
weird i clearly remember clockie arrived in the new world in the end
is that really necessary?
i bet you've got nothing better on your mind!
oh, i've caught wind of the gossip. they're just scared of yanqing and yunli's power, so they don't have the guts to speak up!
guinaifen, an outworlder, unemployed you entered fyxestroll garden with sushang, a cloud knight, the day before yesterday.
as for whether they received the approval of the supreme guardian, well, that's beyond my knowledge and involvement.
people of the underworld, i dare not ask for your forgiveness -- i now know the reality of your decade of suffering
that girl doesn't talk much, but i know she doesn't see us as her enemy.
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
that's the answer, march seventh. this dream bubble is the place where i was born, and i i'm a dweller in this dream just like a memory zone meme.
in this splendid metropolis, some have a dream called penacony, but some have dreams that are no different from reality, even though everyone who comes here harbors the same motive in the beginning.
remember the old man we met earlier? without this dream, he might have completely lost himself.
i see... you've also had a similar experience? then you should know that this me and your memory of me are not the same person.
so this is the extent of "miscreants materializing from the inferno"? seems like doctor primitive wasn't wrong.
the astral express seems fine, but a collision like this in space is a little unusual. even for me, it's a first.
memetic corruption is known to influence one's thoughts even in the real world. and in the dreamscape, they catalyze nightmares that corrupt humans into monkeys.
i understand now i'm sorry, qingni i cannot support your dream because i made a promise to someone else.
general, you said it yourself -- this is beyond your control. it is the law of the alliance, we cannot deviate from it.
everyone has different dreams. if we accept miss topaz's offer, then doesn't that mean our dreams will never come true?
well, i'm going to have to modify your wording here: this little twerp can only stay temporarily until the research is done. or maybe i'll lose interest halfway through and they can just beat it.
sounds like you've taken it in your stride.
my apologies. truth is, i work undercover for the realm-keeping commission.
the same can be said for all of us.
sorry... this space station was entrusted to lady asta by madam herta. i must do this for the safety of the master control zone and the staff there.
so, diviner fu wants to be the general well, firstly, she needs to fix the issue where everyone just wants to nap as soon as she starts to talk.
then, there's a cloud knight soldier over there. perhaps he's here for patrol, but each patrol team must consist of two members, and obviously, he's not following the rules.
reinforcements? i am the reinforcements!
while you were enjoying your playtime on jarilo-vi, diamond was busy taking care of the head honcho of the building material logistics department. that's why he didn't attend today's meeting.
that's the spirit, sounds like you're all fired up! if you could just keep your legs from shaking so much, it would be more convincing, march.
mister reca took over the conversation from charmony bananadvisor on several occasions to steer the class in a certain way did he pick up on something too?
(stop nitpicking the details. if you ask me, i'd say you should take a look outside. but don't get frightened by what you see!)
worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.
s--so, your memory module is okay?
you need to choose your words carefully if you want to persuade him of something. it might be best if i talk to him though i'd need a strategy first.
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see
just as what happened on the xianzhou yaoqing recently.
perhaps it is not my place to say, but i believe qingni has the right to know about the past as the past is starting to affect her future.
the general is a true master of maximizing returns for minimal effort. i cannot match him on that front.
apologies, forgive my curiosity.
a dreamchaser story if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. we're forgetting that the realm-keeping commission was initially investigating whether someone brought a "dangerous object" onto the luofu.
i'm not sure. there don't appear to be any changes however, the many doubts that once plagued me have dissipated.
the ipc is not the garden, and there are real limits to what they can actually do. but you know all this.
thank goodness we got here in time. if we'd arrived any later
i feel like i'm dreaming.
the alchemy commission detained me for some time for a health examination. they released me only after ensuring i was in good condition.
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
i checked the map and found a gate in this open area look, there's a small dock on the other side. he may have left on a starskiff.
mt. zarathustrazapala iskandra -- it's the tallest mountain we know of on the planet
well, i've done my part, and now i'm simply waiting for the fireworks to begin.
don't worry, my lips are sealed~
how could it be? the beauty holds no bias. my words are fair and just.
not to mention he wasn't in bad shape when we found him. thank you for holding back.
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe an explanation.
north as far north as we can go.
see, i told you it wasn't going to be that simple. where is this?
he's arranging for rescue teams and supplies to be sent over. he won't be back for a while.
miss carmella is such a kind person she could get along with hook so quickly.
it's never a bad thing to reflect. one day, we'll all have to face our own farewells.
haha, i have to admit, you definitely have that rock 'n' roll flair.
so, this is the past of the kalevalan people's sword of heroes? you helped the people of that world bring an end to war?
no, no. today is my rest day. there's going to be a show later, so i came early to find a good seat.
i'm sorry for making a scene, but i have to melt down this cursed sword! i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands!
save your flattery. time is hardly a luxury we can squander. to debate the merits of mere mortals in the company of an actual genius? quite the paradox, if you ask me.
i received word from lady fu. the depth of phantylia's infiltration, along with her meticulous planning, makes her extremely difficult to guard against.
i've had the same bad habit as you since the beginning, mister ratio.
but before leaving, i'm sure you all have plenty to say to the nameless of the past?
i appreciate that, but it would be best for you to remain on the express.
then let's wait for pela together. she's in the storage room.
i will protect you. once i gather more information from him, i'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
lynxy? she's more like me. ah, don't tell my brother that, he hates hearing it.
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
i intend to save this remaining bit of fluff in my hand -- proof that it once existed in this beautiful universe.
march is right, grandpa. i heard the escaped prisoner from the shackling prison is beyond formidable. in case anything goes wrong
of course, it would be inappropriate of me to let you return without something to show for it. while i cannot accept your help with regard to the stellaron, i do have a favor to ask. please, after you.
well, ever since you showed up at the ceremony, i had a hunch, so i prepared another sword as a backup plan. and don't worry, this one has nothing to do with heliobi!
your humble servant "aventurine," at your disposal. just a cog in the machine known as the ipc's strategic investment department. nevertheless, i can also play the role of "friend" -- if needed.
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
anyway, i lent out one of her manuscripts as a resource reference not long ago. it should still be in the master control zone. you can take a look if you wish.
theoretically, you can, but it would be very difficult to pull off. after all, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria yet.
everything's fine. we were able to suppress the borisin attacks. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
if i do something about it now, the time saved is from my own effort, not a favor from you all.
alright. no more questions. i hope i didn't take up too much of your time. let's continue on our way.
this is the only way i can ensure everyone's safety...
i think we just made him surrender
and the sudden and consecutive disappearances provided the best environment for chaos to fester.
he says that his responsibility is "preservation." to do that, he must make decisions that best protect humanity.
ah, don't worry. i just want to talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
"at the end of your journey, all that perplexes you and troubles you will resolve."
okay, let's get back to business. since fate has brought us together, it stands to reason that you both seek the accolade of the audition's victor, correct?
simple -- because that murderer could very well be a traitor hiding inside the family.
ninja initiate gigaku, deliver your final line.
finding food is easy, but finding that component is gonna be hard
these poor little things stumbling about
the monsters have gotten stronger somehow. i don't remember them being this difficult
let's check them out now hopefully, we'll find out the reason why igor came to the xianzhou.
it's a pleasure to meet you. you may call me lingsha. i have returned to serve as the head of the luofu's alchemy commission after completing my studies on the zhuming. if you are feeling unwell, i can arrange a healer for you at any time.
...by the way, would you like something to drink? before we go, how about two cups of wake the heck up...? no, four cups.
she was there. she just made sure no one could see her.
maybe you've forgotten, but we were in a tight spot my friend -- there was no time to think. i had to use whatever i could.
i'm not asking your age! i'm asking if you have a dream like yanqing has?
i've heard that many places in the galaxy that partnered with the ipc have become popular areas for interstellar trade.
being surrounded by the universe feels amazing. the luofu feels like a small corner of something much, much bigger.
...a fitting metaphor for the nameless' trailblazing spirit.
did it do anything strange?
i recognize i may not be the most endearing person, but i still uphold fundamental courtesies.
i, and the two behind me, will go deeper into the prison to investigate.
which also means that we must prudently consider our next destination.
maybe i should take a moment to meet with march before the tournament starts?
lastly, we have the main strength of the underworld -- wildfire.
since returning to the luofu, i've been buried in work. there are only three things that bring me joy: eating food, making perfumes, and teasing qingque.
yet here you are leading fugitives into the restricted zone, attacking my silvermane comrades-in-arms, hijacking the energy hub are you really worthy of the landau name?
i have requested that the master diviner prepare a starskiff and open a way through the shortcut.
at least we know who to look for next. we can ask the bloodhound family for information.
seems like it. kids always come to me when they lose stuff.
but do you still remember? i said "i have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
don't fret. all amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
all the miners here huddled together anyone else getting deja vu?
you asked all the questions for us.
when i asked for your names, i couldn't help but think that this "first encounter" was actually a "long-awaited reunion" for you.
oops, there i am rambling on again i almost forgot you're still in the middle of a tournament! good luck! i can't wait to see what you're gonna pull off next!
you know, clockie. i don't think i'll be going anywhere else.
that type of performance isn't really my cup of tea, but i'll let you all decide.
i'm sorry -- herta forbade me from disclosing any information beforehand. she made clear that knowledge would not be paramount to this operation, but rather the lack of it.
or we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
isn't that a bit unnecessary?
most people in a frenzy don't stop to ponder the details.
i am very fond of the furnishings on the express -- it is apparent that whoever decorated the train truly put their heart into it. i wonder who it was?
she is captivated by something that has deeply mesmerized me.
let me tell you something. there were two mutes, but one is dead now, and the other though he's still in penacony, i'm afraid you'll never find him again.
r--really? we don't need to ask miss natasha first?
...when i saw this photo, when i saw you fighting alone just now...
according to him, he is an ipc worker. i believe he's currently resting in the carriage -- he is still in a state of shock.
i was always looking forward to the day she'd return this guitar i thought that would be the day we could bury the hatchet.
i have to make it out alive. my companions are waiting for me.
after all, we need to watch you practice for a few days before we can figure out how talented you are, right?
yes, and i heard that miss robin is going to host the new opening ceremony in the plaza. let's head over and take a look.
seer strategist, our time with the yellowbell is limited. let's get straight to the point.
i already told you about guyun, the sword that was returned during the ceremony. it's a cursed sword with a heliobus inside. and hanguang, the swordsmith who forged it is my father.
can you? you're toooo kind~
it's our stellaron friend's identity, isn't it?
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
seems like the longer i spend in my room, the stranger things are when i emerge.
got any more encouraging words?
glad to meet you, too. are you here to participate in the wardance?
the puzzle for you to solve is to use the limited number of thermic cores at your disposal to illuminate all of the designated snowshine lamps scattered around the victory zone.
we should tell bronya when the time's right. let's not dampen the spirit just yet.
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
earlier at the palace of astrum, i introduced these guests from the astral express to you, elder huaiyan, but with all the people around, we only exchanged pleasantries. now, i'd like to officially introduce them to you.
because you were created for that purpose -- your body has been transformed by the power of an aeon. you are immune to stellaron contamination.
what i'd like to know is pom-pom a rabbit that learned to speak? or a person that was turned into a rabbit?
oh, you're here, yunli. didn't expect you to be so well-informed well, now that you're here, don't forget your manners.
is someone really growing asters on the express? that's quite a bold thing to do!
over here, clara! wanna learn some cool poses?
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
we have experience in preventing stellaron disasters, and we've only come here to lend you that experience.
i do, blade is in a prickly situation. on the xianzhou you're the only one i can turn to.
come, this way -- it's a short walk. don't get lost.
have you forgotten where we are? we landaus ought to know this place better than anywhere the outer reaches of the front line against the fragmentum, belobog's most strategic protective fortress.
everyone, let's gather over here -- we still need to make some preparations.
h--huh? *sigh* you're right, i need to learn to unwind.
tell me the truth sampo -- what are you gonna do about the overworld girl?
it's the stellaron. no need to search high and low -- the traitors have planted it in the ambrosial arbor's delve, thereby causing the tree to grow once again. the disciples of sanctus medicus couldn't hold off any longer.
the true "death" where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
like i said, the sword contains a heliobus. argenti must have been under the control of the sword! maybe he was under its control even before you arrived on the luofu.
this influential figure either has their own ambitions and wants to reach a preliminary agreement, or they plan to put pressure on us to make us back off.
i know you still have many questions for kafka yourself.
she gave it some good thought, but whatever's going on in that supreme guardian's head even bronya might have trouble understanding.
that's the reason i said what i said you might mistake my words for being hurtful -- but the truth is, no amount of words can prepare her for what lies ahead.
pom-pom looks really cute when they walk
be it joy or pain, success or regret, it's all part of the journey. those feelings will accompany you as long as you tread on the trailblaze, and one day you'll grow used to them.
i enter the collected data into the archives' data bank. i try to catalog the people and places the express encounters, and compare and contrast them with the existing records.
since when did the masked fools suddenly start respecting agreements?
i don't try to disagree.
so i'll have to trouble you to take a bit of a detour... apologies.
despite the things he has endured, mister yang stays true to his heart and knows how to appreciate the small joys of everyday life. a man whose wisdom and maturity i find admirable.
arlan, i understood the level of stress you're dealing with as soon as i saw this photo.
like a useless idiot, i saved a fish named "life" out of the cauldron called "death," only to watch it struggle and dive back into the boiling broth.
welcome to the gallery of thoughts! you can think of this as the entrance to the golden hour. i'm here to provide guidance to our guests.
herta, i don't mean to question you, nor do i want to deny the hard work you've put forth for the simulated universe.
the abundance emanator, shuhu, rallied a great army and attacked the alliance i read about it in the shackling prison.
don't misunderstand, that was a mere reminder. this place runs deep, with plenty of unsavory characters. don't forget to stay on your toes. like... keeping your door closed.
huh? you're leaving so soon?
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
despite phantylia's ruthlessness, she spared me when i should have been eliminated. and why did miss ruan mei, who has no ties to the xianzhou, go out of her way to save me?
i'm not surprised to hear that from a nameless. if you ask me, i'd say it was the unity of the family that brought this dream into existence -- and the dream has become just as loving and forgiving as the family.
is that mister giovanni?
these are the archives. it has the records of all the astral express's trips since its first journey.
arlan came to me to learn how to manage pressure from his boss.
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
mister svarog, are you okay? let me repair your language module first
it sounds like similar technology. maybe we'll get a better understanding if we see the manufacturing process with our own eyes.
haha, the seat of divine foresight may seem imposing at first, but having stared at it -- and it back at me -- for hundreds of years we've grown rather tired of one another.
oh! no, not at all! i could do with a hand, actually
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
but jarilo-vi has far exceeded the allotted repayment period. i'm afraid milder solutions aren't the order of the day. so, i proposed to bronya
but now it seems the root of the problem goes way beyond me. there are elements around me that don't align with the harmony and losing my voice is just one of the signs of the sweet dream's collapse.
i'm a traveling merchant, merely passing through. the name's luocha.
sure thing, mister skott. you seem pretty confident that your career and life will last long enough to witness this victory unfold.
when there are no acting gigs, i work as a guide near glaux avenue. if you don't mind, i can show you all the exciting things around here! maybe if i do my job as a guide, people will stop suspecting me
well, the thing is, pain is your body's way of warning you something is wrong. if you ignore it and push through you might end up with some serious injuries without even realizing it.
mister svarog they want to talk to you about going to the surface.
oops, well, looks like i lost. here, the mastery mark is yours.
many of the records and details recorded therein are beyond the knowledge of even the ipc and the intelligentsia guild. that is why it became part of the masses of calculation data for the simulated universe.
right -- if the merchant guild pay back what they owe, the only one barking will be that ipc stooge.
alright, alright~ just putting it out there if you're ever in a pinch, remember i've got your back. i mean, who could resist a guy rocking spikes on his wings?
yep, touch it and find out -- ice cold. i was just about to fix it up.
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
indeed. in kafka's words that's also a "missing part" of my life.
the future is like a labyrinth: every divergence is merely an inducement. there is only one real path.
don't blame yourself. you know what i'm more concerned about. has your body had any changes since you swallowed the crimson moon?
it would serve you well not to underestimate them. they are as skilled in combat as they are tenacious in spirit. i worry they might pose a problem for you.
don't worry, i'll do something about it. let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
i guess once things settle down, i can spare a moment to contemplate the stars.
hoolay, have you ever wondered why it took them seven centuries to come to your rescue?
my name is gepard landau, i'm a captain of the silvermane guards. if you discover anything suspicious in the city, you can always report it to me.
his invitation to debate this matter publicly was a chance for the more difficult business owners to hear from you directly.
thank you, general. we apologize for taking up your time with such triviality.
i've never been able to really get into modern music, but i find opera enchanting. time passes like a river whenever i listen to the strings and voices in an opera performance.
mengming, the owner of the sleepless earl, went to great efforts to set up her shop, all so that workers like us can catch a break and find some joy in our lives!
the path to hell is paved with heavenly treasure; devils trying to fool you, better get your head together. the hunters hide greed with a welcoming smile; don't be beguiled, it could be your last mile.
a meticulously choreographed "chance meeting" sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
but i've seen enough failures in my time. and i want to believe that your loyalty has never wavered.
that means we're evenly matched, right?
a one-armed knight from the knights of beauty passed away in his pursuit of beauty.
mm... i need to feel the pressure he's feeling so i can understand what it's all about.
i remember this one best. wright has a broken leg.
that's not how it works. the desire to know your past embodies purity itself -- a thing of immense value.
she's the girl playing in the games parlor, right? she must have played for years to be that good with how good her skills are, it's almost a martial art for her.
never mind. it would seem the time has come for other means of dismantling the xianzhou from within
your performance at the theme park was wonderful and grandiose... a simple yet practical technique that fooled almost everyone.
i merely fulfilled my duty, and kept my promise to cirrus.
of course. i--i'm sure there's a story behind it, but that's between you and mother -- i won't pry.
i wanted to come here to perform for cocolia. to say goodbye
old oti is a tricky opponent. i didn't expect him to take the risky step of "going public" at such a critical moment for penacony.
let's see if there's anyone waiting to greet us.
even though sweet dreams are nice, they're just illusions. but for him, they're the only way to survive, even if it means giving up on reality that's not really living at all.
i should go back and give her an update and thank her for her guidance.
don't worry, seele. like i said, it was just the exhaustion. svarog was deliberately holding back.
you call that normal? i might have let it slide if it was in the cage on second thought, no, that was cringe even by fight club standards.
well then, we shall oblige.
i brought you all some gifts. hope i didn't cause too much trouble.
humanity flaps their wings twice as they complete their journey: once when they are born, and once when they die. in order to flap my own wings and soar again
my reason for coming to this martial tournament was to verify if you were good enough to contend against competitors from other worlds. and now i see you're good enough.
i happened to be helping out at the museum, so we both ended up waiting for you here.
mister svarog, can i delete some of them?
even though i had heard the legends of this sword from the delegation, delving into its memories was still fascinating. yunli, i trust guyun's experiences have changed your mind.
trust his judgment, and keep watching. we'll be right there.
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
i'm the complete march seventh with all of your forgotten memories.
no one can refuse the secret of the aeons, not even zandar. we'll definitely get a response.
i'll be gone very soon. jing yuan is still recovering, and the cloud knights won't protect me anymore it remains to be seen how the six charioteers will react to my presence.
i, on behalf of the organizers, extend my sincere congratulations to you, wishing you joy under their radiance.
be careful, dangerous is an understatement with this item. i'll take my leave.
i wouldn't say that -- a good businesswoman doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve. besides, the alliance has weathered plenty of challenges. we can handle this situation.
remember, it's often the unassuming pawns -- the lone traveler or the worm that subdues the dragon -- that leave even the best strategists helpless.
long story short, regardless of why the xianzhou alliance invited us, joining this wardance is of august meaning to belobog.
bailu told me you two heard me yelling before you showed up. is that true?
in other words, svarog is the target of both our efforts. if we can't deal with the boss, we can't deal with anything.
i'd like to hear their explanations.
now go and experience it for yourself. i will guide you in the simulated universe to make sure nothing happens to you! i'll even give you a substantial reward.
i don't think i've ever been this far away from the xianzhou before! who'd have thought i'd be hopping star systems only to wind up on this cold, icy planet?
the memories of my past life are like shattered glass i can't piece together the reality from the individual shards
by the look on your face i'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
i don't want to make things difficult for official dahao. let's do this his way and prove my innocence.
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
i admire your convictions. perhaps, what i need, more than asceticism, is knowledge.
besides, i'm a researcher how could i not get excited about the chance to explore new worlds up close? everyone gets tired of living in small places like belobog after a few years, right?
i once held the same ceremony on the fanghu, some thirty years or so ago now. painful memories don't ever fade away with time, and i don't want to bear witness to those scenes again.
she's actually on the correct path. she just needs to continue a little further -- i trust that she too will realize this soon.
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
truth be told, i am a guest like everyone. penacony is my hometown, but i left when i was older. i was graciously invited this time to return and sing a song at the charmony festival.
well then, i will take care of the cirrus situation. as for what gets written in the luofu's ghostly grove, i'll leave that up to you.
how many more of your comrades are here? where were you planning to meet hoolay?
even if life is short, memories can be eternal. as long as black swan still remembers me, the mark i leave on this world will not disappear.
i'm sorry, i don't know much about the watchmaker, but mikhail
did something happen in the dreamscape?
yunli! these esteemed guests have brought back your father's last work. where are your manners!?
in any case, i must thank the both of you for your assistance.
just a few intense emotions. as far as how we'll use them, you just wait and see!
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
it makes sense to have the foxians keep an eye on their arch-nemesis. since you trust my judgment, i'll repay that trust. what do you think about all this, general huaiyan?
hey! wait a sec -- uh those intruders, i wanted to ask. what crime have they committed?
i don't think searching like this is the best way
i was frozen in place, unable to move. it was only when my mother pushed me away from the deadly swing of the cursed sword that i managed to escape.
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
mm i haven't kept track in a while. since i started training at flamewheel forge, the number should be three hundred and twelve.
how can that be? my ship was the last one into port before the jade gate was shut. the sky-faring commission has already locked down starskiff haven entirely
if she can remedy that habit during her trip with you, then i guess it will have been worth it.
i imagine this knowledgeable doctor friend of yours has been of great help, yes?
that's not the only thing you won't have heard of down here, princess.
as for cocolia, the best side of her will live on in people's memory. that's not all bad
the family itself is a huge, perfect building. like... a living idol.
yes, i think this could well be the best time.
in my opinion, you enjoy playing the role of a joker, spouting off outrageous opinions just to seem objective and indifferent whenever you feel like it.
congratulations to the both of you on becoming the festive superstars of this year's charmony festival. before entering the grand theater
aventurine said something that concerns me
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
a ninja's super hearing can capture even the death of a proton. you spoke loudly before me. i wasn't eavesdropping.
if you want to give me a sword, just say the word, grandpa. no need to beat around the bush.
you're here. i just finished training.
worry not. as a knight, i bear the resolve and honor of assured victory -- my body, tempered by countless battles, will not easily be broken.
his scent is so faint it's almost imperceptible, but it also carries a pungent smell of rust. he must have many stories to tell.
you must be the messengers from the xianzhou yaoqing, i assume.
regarding the recent mishap i understand it negatively impacted some of our guests. as a member of the family, it's only right for me to come forward and offer my apologies to everyone.
are you saying you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and is hiding something from us?
all of you, stay focused. i'm right behind you.
thank you. i hope the next time i come i won't disturb anyone.
there's always a paradise that needs to be built. that vow is like the sun in the sky --perhaps i'll melt and fall before reaching it but some hardships i must endure.
so many buttons how many centuries would it take to press them all?
as for screwllum he's a good-hearted noble. it's just that his area of interest doesn't quite align with my research goals.
the university plans to hold an academic conference on the topic of "trailblazing" in the moment of sol. the astral express has been invited as guests to the conference.
so have you made up your minds?
hey now, you've got me all wrong! i just enjoy watching people fight, that's all. fierce words, fists flying what's not to like?
don't forget to rest! you guys have got a busy day ahead of you!
i ought to sit down and conceptualize how to incorporate and play up the way of the dazzling ninja in my narration
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
well, let me tell you what i discovered, and i'm sorry -- it's bad news.
come on, let's take the microfilm back to the museum.
let's try a different name, my dear friend.
in our family we have a strong military tradition going back generations -- many a landau has died in their prime. there's not a lot of "brother and sister time." everyone just does their best to get on with their life.
yes, mister micah thinks the same. but that perseverance of theirs isn't going to save dreamflux reef. i don't wish for this film to develop into a tragedy either.
each of us has our own past and destined ends. and on this journey, we have been invited by diamond to join him.
signing off now! time to get some songwriting going~
could it be...? velite, perhaps you still bear sting pheromones on your body.
hehe, there's really no need -- i've spent my years traveling the universe! not to mention, i'm younger and stronger than i look.
if you see your own name, don't be surprised, i also recorded this trip to the archives.
you're right, an oversight on my part.
jade stone can be pawned off, but not everything can be used in an exchange. outside of life itself, there are more valuable things that i don't want to give up.
once the dreamscape is swayed, i'll complete the second step. i'll fine-tune the slumbering souls with the song of the harmony, interrupting them with the discord of "trailblaze" and guiding them towards reality.
it's just i see people fighting for their lives and here i am thinking about how to escape i feel guilty about that.
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
i had surmised as much. i knew you wouldn't have avoided mentioning the bird for no reason.
wait a minute, you said these weapons have been hidden here from the very beginning? that means the architects of jarilo-vi never used them in their fight against the legion.
oh, really? i think that towering tree looks pretty impressive.
once you've broken through the front line there's nothing more we can do for you. you'll have to find out for yourselves what lies within the northern fragmentum.
at the same time, the blessing of remembrance will fall upon everyone. please look forward to this surprise.
you should meet the others of the genius society. some of them will trick you into thanking them after they milk you dry. at least i have my honesty going for me.
the encounter at the dreamscape hotel was a sign.
the meaning of a flower lies in the duration of its bloom, and not in its petals, aroma, or the seeds it leaves behind.
you are mistaken, luka. it's not pity. i am lending you this victory, and you will repay me by winning the wardance.
*sigh* i calmed down and thought about it a bit. if it turns out that woman isn't lying, then a lot of innocent people are gonna get hurt now's the time for thinking about other people hehe *sigh*
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
do you need me to point the way for you again?
exactly what it means: down.
you're too lazy to be a suspect, right?
in any case, you should at least pay her a visit.
and what was this grand strategy proposed by jingliu and that traveler?
you're right. i "took" it with my skills, so i guess you can say i'm a robber or something. how dare he imply i'm a thief. totally different!
we should consider pom-pom's opinion, too. they don't know we're considering amphoreus as a destination.
the temperature is returning to normal the monsters are retreating.
fangs bared, then add a little red dye the more ghastly the expression, the better! interesting, very interesting!
if you limit your involvement to this, there's still room for excuses. if it were me
a persons's footfall reveals a lot about their strength and emotions -- much like how a person's breath may serve as an indication of their overall health.
and all the while, people would be getting sick, losing their homes, and fighting just like in the mine.
for me, living one's days out like that is too repetitive
why would you think that? i've never harbored any ill intentions well, not when you were around, anyway.
so, you relied on this rhetoric to manipulate the ignorant members of the vidyadhara into serving you?
uh-huh anyway, what are you gonna do now, hm? hack an ipc branch nearby and get your accounts back?
according to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain path or aeon's power.
ugliness... the inharmonious pitch has surfaced.
it's the only plant here that looks like it's still alive
it's just a few steps away -- you're not leaving with us?
i'm qingque, a diviner from the divination commission. you wanna play celestial jade? okay, come back during my work hours.
don't worry -- those things aren't hostile.
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
huh? you mean the foxian soul-soothing ceremony?
so, what are your thoughts on all of this, general feixiao?
that's exactly what i've come to scalegorge waterscape to find out.
next, should we pin down the identity of the perpetrator? this evidence i've been staring at it all day but, there's nothing that can identify the perp.
making a big show of it will only scare the snake deeper into the grass a good hunter must operate alone.
i'm really, really disappointed in you.
the president commands the trust of many reputable shops in the alley. their support for him was likely to be a big obstacle to your rejuvenation project.
mister assistant detective, please feel free to point out a suspect as the murderer.
in that case, it looks like someone wants to make things difficult for us. since kafka's here, i wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be that stellaron hunter hacker girl's handiwork.
you work for the sky-faring commission, so i assume you're aware of its destructive power.
sorry, hardly the time for me to be obsessing over all this.
soon enough, it will no longer be a person wielding a sword but a mindless killing machine consumed by bloodlust and murderous thoughts.
so, have you found any information about her?
it's hard to forget anything tingyun says. the foxians' talent with words should be utilized to its maximum potential, no?
so what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
there may have been a few heliobi that slipped through the net, but they are of no major concern.
thanks for your kindness and sincerity, elder huaiyan, but is it appropriate to tell everyone here about the marshal's orders?
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
as the newly appointed cauldron master, there's been much to take care of within the alchemy commission. it's only now that i've had the chance to speak with you. please forgive the delay, elder.
you guys have some moves. if you need my help with anything, just shout.
well, i--it's just the dust has settled now. the stellaron problem has been resolved, and cocolia
penacony's grand museum, the primal waking library, the paperfold academy the pasts that we chase may be stored in these places.
i left my home in a hurry, too i know how it feels.
your unwavering faith in the trailblaze is truly impressive.
my orders are to arrest you. it is for the adjudication panel to present you with the nature and penalty of your alleged crimes.
i will say goodbye here to the me of yesterday.
we may live underground, but we won't be buried by this city.
looks like your memokeeper friend has finally arrived.
ah, it looks like the entire delegation from the xianzhou yaoqing has gathered at the alchemy commission. why don't we go see general feixiao and bring her some fruit?
it's alright. we're in this together.
it wasn't as fun as you think.
don't worry. now that you're at the alchemy commission, i'll do my best to find a solution.
a fun-seeker investigating fun things in the universe -- i guarantee there's no way that could ever go wrong!
where are you going? please take me with you~
excuse me, have you seen three outworlders? one of them's older -- wears glasses -- calm demeanor?
the next opponents are several cloud knights ah, they're like the silvermane here no, why am i explaining this to you? you should know better than me i'm the only one who doesn't know anything.
luka should tell her to go back to town -- he's always worrying after the kids' safety.
no murder case this time around?
is this some kind of villain entrance line?
he says my swordsmanship is outstanding, and i think he's a master both in the past and present. so you could say we completely approve of each other now!
i'm afraid it won't be wise for us to continue our investigations together, mister boothill.
in fact, it once belonged to me and cocolia. it was our shared treasure. if you don't mind, bronya could i take it back to the workshop?
perhaps it has its own set of authorization mechanisms, and only those it recognizes are permitted to sit on it.
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves
i have a bad feeling about this luka always does things on the spur of the moment.
you're welcome. i hope you like it.
i am sorry for our improper management, and i truly appreciate your assistance, general.
no, there's no need! i don't want to see sebas right now. sorry, mother
if you're looking to meet her, the lunarescent depths might be your best bet. i spotted her heading that way earlier.
so, the imbibitor lunae's reincarnation has returned to the luofu and will attend the wardance. i'd love to have a drink with you should the chance present itself.
they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
looks like it's over already.
if i remember correctly, you, march, and dan heng came here on that train -- the "astral express" -- right?
you've clearly heard a lot of folk tales, but that's not the kind of "cursed sword" i'm talking about.
chin up. let's go. we should head to qlipoth fort and meet with the supreme guardian.
you are indeed more like a "medical doctor" than a scholar.
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
incredible mister giovanni wasn't kidding when he said i'd be up against some exceptional players!
slow down, seele! listen to my analysis first.
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
a list of the missing researchers and their details.
an amicassador's seal, a small box a knife? a bow, and something wrapped up tight i wonder what this is.
so you've been to places way bigger than this?
and "little lynxy" is the youngest sister of the landau family, by the way
afraid? well, you do have a different aura from other cursed swords, but you're just trying to use my curiosity to lure me in.
my home planet was extremely resource-poor. to survive, people worked laboriously, manufacturing products for other civilizations in the galaxy -- mostly in the chemical or heavy industries.
yunli and i are will head out and purchase some sword practice equipment for miss march. think of it as a little initiation gift.
that's the kind of treasure i've always yearned for, but the general's position won't allow him to accept such a gift.
this is... a dead end.
you see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. the nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don't want to face will never come.
being able to see an actor who isn't a monkey fills me with such joy.
calm down, i'm just here to soak in the festive vibe. this may be your room now, but half a system hour ago, it was still mine.
it promulgated rapidly like cancer cells, so the interastral peace corporation named it the cancer of all worlds.
*sigh* forgive me, but i cannot disclose this information.
this is your future that elio has foreseen. do you like it?
well, did he enlighten you?
you want to open a bonajade exchange branch on this ship, too?
the artisanship commission delve should have suspended operations after the stellaron corrosion began. why haven't these people taken starskiffs to safety?
making the best of every single day and living life the way i want to -- those are the most important things to me.
from the day i set foot on the battlefield, i knew that my blazing wings would eventually be extinguished. all i can hope is, before i return to the earth, i'll be able to see the brightest light in the sky.
you were completely determined when melting down the sword, so why the sudden change of heart?
thank you all for your understanding. now, i must take my leave. for my next gift, i promise you this: i will not fail the good name of beauty.
hehe, it strikes me that you'd use any means to achieve your goal, benefactor.
the sofa is so soft
there's nothing to say about your past. you only remember me because i was the one with you when your soul was born.
i had a great time -- it's been a lot of fun.
but, the influx of people attending the wardance is like a breeding ground for disorder and rumors. one wrong move, and the luofu could be in a world of chaos.
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
congrats to you both -- you're champions now.
now that mister xiao is on board, his shop can be part of the logistics network we've been working on.
strange is this also the work of the heliobus?
i didn't find the information. it came to me. it was from a lady concerned with the future of the harmony.
it looks like someone used it and then destroyed it -- possibly kafka.
really? i'm not so sure about that
general jing yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, i'll take care of it for you. you need the final word from the ten-lords commission to quell any doubts.
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly
we can't trust everything kafka says. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
don't you get it? if he wanted me dead, i wouldn't have had the chance to even muster an ounce of resistance. in short, it was mister boothill who spared my life.
no matter how astronomically distant you are, the luofu cloud knights will always come to the aid of the crew, whatever your need may be.
meaning it could end in a fight.
thank you. i hope there are new discoveries to be made each time i visit.
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
no one knows what he did after he left jarilo-vi, and why he decided to come back.
i've heard about what happened to your planet, so i understand how you need this win. just one more step, and you'll take belobog's name into the history books with you.
it's okay. i won't be sad. i understand what pela really feels.
our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. see you later.
for some reason, i feel like i can open up to you
swords have a temper. sometimes, you have to touch them to calm them down -- put the hilt of the sword in your hand, and it'll tell you what's wrong!
remember zhongshan's face was disfigured after the incident at the cliff, right?
how would it be if the ipc were to freeze all of them? including all your game records?
to me, holding a physical book constantly reminds one of the gravity of knowledge, an experience that digital data just can't replicate.
it was a long time ago. the same time the underworld was sealed off, i think
a judge of the ten-lords commission has no past. once one has entered the service of the commission, all links with the outside world are severed
on the surface, things may appear to be getting better since the astral express lent a helping hand, but sooner or later the underlying problems will resurface.
our little girl in red is truly impressive. how did she get that giant tinhead to listen to her?
perhaps i'm too sensitive she did promise to help us. i just hope she keeps her word
prepare for my departure. i've always believed that a person's starting point should also be his last stop.
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
you seem pretty exhausted, don't overexert yourself. i'll do it.
march is right. though the fact that the distress signals have ceased means we're probably too late but i still think we should investigate the situation there.
i know you have many questions do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme
i was under the impression that i had successfully routed all of them. however, it appears that the stings continue to pursue us.
because i mustn't give the legion any chance to reach the master control zone by the elevator. i must ensure the safety of the station's staff.
come on, march! let's go find him!
the match hasn't started. how do you know i can't defeat you? my fist might not be slower than your bullet.
"when we look up into the night sky, the stars aren't really there. the glimmering lights we see are merely the images of stars from long ago."
haha, only joking -- i'm needed in belobog. still, if i ever forget how to play the guitar or fix things in my workshop there'll be a spot for me here, right? it's a deal!
the severity of the corrosion becomes worse as it grows.
look, those are my opponents for my first match.
my name is tingyun. i'm the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. may i venture to know the illustrious names of my heroes?
the name's serval. i'm, uh an ex-engineer from the technology division and gepard's sister. pleasure to meet you, chief!
it would have nothing to do with me. but i must warn you: it is likely that someone would step forward to stop you.
go look them up yourself. i don't know your definition of "fun."
yes she is a high-ranking member of the ipc, after all. she knows how to use words to her advantage.
however, you must understand that debt collection is a big part of my job. i've dealt with cases far more difficult than belobog's.
these borisin are disguised as foxians. please warn the cloud knights immediately.
well, i do know about the box and the cursed sword.
march, may your blade be sharp and your victory glorious.
things aren't looking too optimistic, doctor. i'm starting to break out in a cold sweat. do you reckon... there's still any chance of a comeback given how things are?
what has happened is destined to happen again -- that was my conclusion after having met her.
no need to be polite, i can help any-- huh? you're just here to say hello? you don't need my help?
huh, why are you two so straight-faced? can't you look a little happy?
i shall take my leave, mister luka.
i already said there's no rush to give me an answer. because no matter what happens... the outcome will remain the same.
shouldn't this be expected of a memokeeper?
that sword she holds in her heart has long since split heaven and earth but having harnessed that kind of power, she is no longer a mere master of the sword.
go and talk to these people. they're all customers of my pawnshop. see for yourself if their wishes have come true.
wow, i've never seen anything like this before! it's so much more spectacular than the little plaza in exalting sanctum.
indeed, and i extend my deepest apologies for doing so. i wish to remedy the situation, hence my arrival on the astral express.
just like everyone in this story, hurtling onwards along the path of destiny with passion and courage, for the things that breathe meaning into their lives.
clouds knights don't visit the ambrosial arbor without a reason, plus i'm new here
that galaxy ranger imposter who is it?
unfortunately, i'd like to speak the harsh truth before laying out my plan. let's cut to the chase. first, your plan won't work. penacony has no way of sidestepping the ipc and going public.
it's okay. they're all my guests.
remarkable. a vision that would transcend both time and generations of belobogians. madam rand was truly an inspiring leader.
once you secured the championship title, she wasted no time in reaching out to me. she mentioned that you have undeniably showcased your skill
whether it's a dragon lady like you or an ordinary person like me, i feel like many people's lives follow a similar trajectory.
you're right. it seems she really hasn't considered anything.
well, i heard that she's a silvermane guard that was sent to arrest you. i expected you to be less friendly around each other are you worried about her?
i'd rather not play around. we don't have very much time.
he had no name or memories -- he only relied on the guidance of that trace of beauty to keep moving forward...
with such a powerful weapon, i'd be able to take on a hundred fragmentum monsters at once!
you two! it's too dangerous here. find the silvermane guards and wildfire at the bridge -- they'll protect you.
those guys can't think outside the box. of course they can't wrap their heads around my design. *sigh* i thought it was something big. leave it here. i'll take a look.
by imprisoning hoolay in the xianzhou luofu, the marshal both suppressed the dangerous intentions of the yaoqing foxians and warned the xianzhou luofu to refrain from repeating its mistake.
i'm afraid that's impossible -- the artisanship commission's hall of jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process.
i'm very upset he didn't obey my orders and insisted on searching the storage zone even though everyone had already evacuated.
poor little march, being bullied by a mechanical scoring system don't pay them any mind, let's go!
uh, you remember the silvermane guards i mentioned? that's them
i'm not the kind that takes risks. the cornerstone must be in the custody of the family.
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
i know she's used to going into the snow plains alone for research, and we've always believed she can protect herself
interesting, don't you think? i fulfill people's desires and grant them favors, and soon, they come back to me with even greater desires.
to be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed" but we did escape.
next time, i think i should be the one trailblazing with you guys -- welt can stay on the express.
the reports look pretty normal today. you can go have some rest.
one last question. screwllum, genius though you are, can you deduce why i did this?
thanks to her, the antimatter legion outside is not much of a threat anymore. the space station's repairs and reconstruction can also begin smoothly, but internally...
i want to meet the current high elder of the vidyadhara.
glad to make your acquaintance -- i'm topaz, an investment expert from the interastral peace corporation. i'm here on jarilo-vi for a special business assignment.
*sigh* games are always fun in the eyes of a child but to an adult, they are but one among many ways of solving a problem.
if this "ipc" does indeed possess the magical power to restore belobog back to its former self overnight, then i think the answer is clear.
such a fascinating ball of fluff. i imagine them to be exceptionally fitting perched atop a knight's shoulder, serving as a symbol of honor.
that's why the marshal decided to imprison hoolay in the luofu. it wasn't an honor but rather a warning.
this is not my pad, it's just where i sleep.
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
i wouldn't dare! trust me, we're getting close!
hm? norbert, is that you?
i find it hard to believe a man who's full of deception.
"dealt with before"? so "death" does happen in penacony, if i understand correctly?
sure, let's reconnect later.
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future
anyway, since you're both here it only means one thing war! an aetherium war, that is
i won't forgive myself for past sins under the pretext of "knowing nothing," nor will i allow you to evade accountability.
miss samuel, i think you'd best turn around. it seems you're not quite familiar with the term "pawn."
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
right on time! xiaohan is about to share his strategy for the upcoming hearing.
i thought the general's retainers were all burly martial masters. i didn't expect yanqing to be so
all these years, and the view at the alchemy commission hasn't changed a bit.
i can understand your sense of urgency. but before i leave, i have a question for cirrus, who has been listening this whole time -- i trust you are familiar with apyra
of course -- i wouldn't ask you to start a whole investigation from scratch.
don't treat me like a new recruit. i'm all too familiar with the monsters of the fragmentum. let's get ready to fight!
it's nice to see you all again, astral express crew. i heard my disappearance caused quite the commotion out there i'm really sorry about that.
if i do not want a secret revealed, the most foolproof way is to destroy it. the anti-truth serum will make you forget the brief period we spent together.
i can still hardly believe it. i'll use my own methods to locate tingyun's whereabouts, but at present i
yeah, i agree! warriors have to keep challenging themselves and strong enemies. if you stop moving forward and get scared by the enemy in front of you, all past battles become meaningless
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
remember that night of hallucinations? in this very familiar car, the ugly giant sting solidified our friendship.
reveal your true identity and intentions otherwise, brace yourself for gravitational disintegration.
i'm a captain, not an adjudication panel. as a belobog citizen, you have the right to defend yourself, but that can only take place under the scrutiny of the architects, not now.
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know
be very careful and watch your step as you make your way through.
not to mention, forty-five system hours ago a stellaron burst occurred on the luofu.
anyway, it's just a legend. i see this view every day on my way to work -- i'm kinda bored of it.
i'm liking the energy
your efforts for the justice of penacony are evident to everyone and have been widely observed.
my real name is guinevere. guinaifen is the xianzhou name shangshang gave me. who is shangshang you ask? she's my best friend -- sushang the cloud knight. have you met her?
yes sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
i am truly happy for the dreamchasers on penacony -- the cosmos' brightest and, let's admit, dimmer intellects are now at their service.
the sofas here all look tailor-made -- perfect for vip guests!
thanks, franz. i'll put in a good word for you with my brother and get him to promote you!
i can tell the two of you have a close bond. if you get the chance, see if you can persuade her to open up about it.
i wonder if you'd be interested in seawater magma flavored pastries
before you leave the luofu, there are two things i wish to gift the express.
yeah, i was gonna ask what was all that supposed to be?
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
but you're not wrong. appearances seemingly tell us little about the lives of the xianzhou's leaders, no matter how long those lives may have been.
but that's fun too -- the masked dreams connect to each other seamlessly, like you're walking in a maze. maybe one day, i'll find the way out!
boarding exam? like a test? i can do that! that sounds like the admission system that schools in belobog use!
is it also a cartoon character created by the watchmaker?
after wandering around a bit, we finally bought a few dozen boxes of the zhuming's special salty-sweet pastries and ended up munching on them for several months.
then the ipc would've been more brutal, and the situation would've been much harder for us thankfully, xiaohan turned out to be upright and reasonable.
please let me activate the mechanism before we all move forward, and please watch your steps.
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
surprised? my reasons are pretty simple.
he was your tail for so many years, i'm sure he'd come back to say hi or bye.
heh, suddenly you don't know where it is?
buy. yes, just buy it.
give it a little push and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
did he spend his whole life falling? or did some long-life prisoner drain his life essence? we'll never know. anyway, please don't try anything like that.
no, it's not. grandpa made a promise to the delegation, and going back on his word would tarnish his reputation and make things difficult for the luofu.
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
well, you're just as good at comforting people as mister moze.
by the way, general, you met the healer lady, yes? could you show me the medicine she prescribed you?
i've been here many times in my life, but the scenery can never fully reveal itself to me.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
hahahaha, you needn't worry! that silvermane girl wouldn't be afraid of an old veteran anyway.
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
grandpa always asks me to go look at swords with him, but he hasn't said anything about this one. it's really weird.
this is the road that topaz took when she left rivet town.
it's too early to say, but it was a radical move. it means that we must have broached a highly sensitive subject a secret that she's sparing no effort to protect.
there's no stopping you once you've made up your mind. fine, we'll do it your way.
you are not wrong. my battle style has always been "simple and effective" -- one cut and it's over.
penacony's a true-blue land of dreams. how many across the stars would spend half their lives, just to acquire an admission ticket into the reverie?
tsk, just be patient! i'll explain everything when the time comes!
there are abominations up ahead. careful, everyone.
like all the other cursed swords i'll separate it from the heliobus, then i'll melt it down and make it part of the "blade of forged remnants."
take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss
even if what you say is true, to host a stellaron as a short-life species would only spell an early demise. it looks like you are not fated to live a long life.
make any funny moves, and i'll smash that scrap metal.
back when i first arrived in the underworld, i used to bring natasha the medicines she needed. i did that for a while, and before long it was medicines and intel. you know how these things work.
meeting you has been a great help to me, and i'm glad to have discovered this side of myself. i also feel grateful for the opportunity to tell you this in person
i haven't had this much fun in a long time
this qian ketong person should be sparkle's targeted victim this time around.
if being a workaholic were a disease, skott would be in the icu! it's okay to enjoy your work, but causing trouble in society is another story!
you sound exactly like master yanqing. but for now, both he and yunli have been forced to go to the alchemy commission for some well-needed rest.
as for how we'll communicate with lynxy in the future we'll have to have a good think about it.
so mysterious! but it doesn't matter, because now i'm going to step into the ring and see just how strong this "iron arm" is for myself!
if you have any other questions, you are welcome to come to himeko and me.
of course. you're not too busy these days, right? i'll give you a shout if i need help.
so you'll be living forever in this dreamscape, right?
besides, you guys need someone familiar with the divination commission to show you the way, right? then let's go.
i love your attitude, my dear. i have to admit you're different from your friend here -- your senses are much sharper.
this actor's lines may be somewhat cryptic, but yes, the general plot direction is on point.
madam herta's reputation precedes her of late -- her name is constantly mentioned in the company's broadcasts and programs.
i was requested by mister sunday to bring him the suspect. my name is ratio. he should've mentioned it to you.
hehe, correct, but i haven't come here to challenge a championship contender.
of course. we raised the accusation, we will carry the burden of proof.
if tears were worth money, i could depend on them to become the richest person in the cosmos!
in my humble opinion, while a cloud knight is commendable by securing victories, it's even more so to pass on your skills and spread the way of swordplay.
the battle is fierce, i need to get to the front line. i'll leave the command post to my officers.
but that's just my personal opinion. in the end, it's all up to lady bronya.
since the stellaron hunters lured you to our ship, we shall move with the current. you are hereby authorized to do as you deem fit on the luofu, with the goal of bringing kafka out of the shadows and under our control.
seems like the mansion's entire workforce were assigned other tasks before robin's death.
she's famous in belobog. you might have heard other people mention her in passing.
oh, i almost forgot this is my apprentice, yunli
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
the luofu's high elder? i once got to share a table with her in aurum alley. we ate tons of scallion chicken and fried rice balls. we even exchanged numbers and agreed to come back to aurum alley for a big dinner sometime.
mister xiao, i'm mingxi, the secretary of the merchant guild. we're here to talk about--
my position is simple: it doesn't matter to me. i suggest you ignore my opinions and make your own choice.
uh kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
and now i wish for you to attend this meeting with me.
the important thing right now is to generate enough revenue before the payment due date.
however, someone had already been on the scene before we arrived.
he cast aside his physical form in order to etch the memories of rage and sadness deeper into his being.
how interesting. for a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.
learned doctor, i'm grateful for your help. the family will surely reward a righteous person like you.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them
now that i see you again, i realize your sword was right. it wasn't me who took your sword. it was you who lost focus.
he says he doesn't want outsiders getting involved in the xianzhou's internal affairs, which is understandable.
actually, i have another selfish motive i want to prove to cocolia that i was right. once we've taken care of the stellaron maybe she'll go back to how she was.
*sigh* i'm only helping arlan. you're here to look for him, right? he's with march.
the word "borisin" was only used to refer to those wolf masters. i'm a foxian who was born in one of the "fallen territories"
nice to meet you, i'm natasha -- an underworld doctor. feeling sick? take a seat, let me take a look.
looks like march's curiosity has been piqued.
hello, mister gallagher, sir. judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
*sigh* what took you so long?
you really don't have to. i'd like to hang out on my own. bye!
yes, but what made you ask that all of a sudden?
an abandoned orphan, a cursed little girl, the last descendant of the puppet clan... i can tailor it to the tastes of the individual~
don't imitate the memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! well
and, as a memokeeper, i also have to fulfill my responsibilities and harvest some interesting memories.
and this young friend is?
yes, this is my duty.
aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. but this galaxy ranger we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
actions? ohhhh, i get you! another plate of delicious snacks, coming right up!
it is safe to assume that two people entered the simulated universe -- her, and her companion.
ultimately, only "heroes" like yourselves manage to achieve success.
so he boarded the ship of a troupe called the "mourning actors" and escaped the ipc. after a while he made his way to the express, and he's stayed here longer than anywhere else.
researching history and producing animations i'd say they go hand in hand.
haha, don't worry -- guest students don't get a lot of homework. besides, all of the professors and students are busy preparing for the festivities. just treat it as a party.
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
even if you wish for it... i can't promise you anything.
i am a fugitive, after all. i must remove any chance of being detected by the family.
film! did you hear that? that film he mentioned must be the same one that was stolen from the museum.
at the time, the supreme guardian was none other than cocolia rand.
one more thing don't let her discover you. otherwise, she'll probably get upset with us.
you're here, then let's get straight to business.
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
hmm. even the pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, not to mention the rear wheelset bearing. this looks like the work of svarog's minions.
and yet she didn't come to any of us for help. that's not like her.
of course! the nameless have quite the reputation -- you're following in the footsteps of the great akivili, after all!
let's cut to the chase. before the crisis struck, the astral express was guided here by a stellaron hunter, a wanted felon, in an attempt to resolve the stellaron crisis.
so you've made it your daily mission to tease me, huh?
i vow to take down a lord ravager and teach the ruin legion the true meaning of the hunt.
i'll be in the crowd, cheering you on. remember to give it your all, and most importantly -- have fun!
half an amber era ago, the family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that everyone on the planet became part of the family.
but i can't abandon my brother and the other guards -- i'm a landau! it's up to you now, i believe in you. you've given me new hope!
uhh, that was me copying video titles from the hottest streamers on the luofu i heard they help attract more viewers.
we must rescue the messengers, get out of here, and spread the news. we mustn't give up as long as there's a glimmer of hope!
you wouldn't want the stellaron in you to hurt all the people in the space station either, right?
that's right. it seems like she did a great deal of research and calculations in dreamflux reef before abruptly passing away.
um what's going on?
i'll keep talking to him -- maybe i can eventually unlock his chattier side!
penacony has made a solemn commitment to protect the safety of anyone inside a family dream. any person in distress will be forcibly awakened and safely returned to reality.
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning
same as you guys -- on terminals.
now that you've returned to the stage, what are you planning to do?
why is there chili sauce?
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details well that's reassuring.
so that's what's been happening -- no wonder we hadn't heard from bronya recently. *sigh* after all these years in isolation and without a single word from below, this is what's become of the underworld
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously well, at least we finally get to go through
what do you think? are you satisfied with your result?
fight with us, sister. let's dispel the shadow of the past once and for all!
come on, let's go to the restricted zone. if we can get ahead of the curve and find the stellaron, cocolia will be out of options.
but really, i just want those marvels of weaponry to all have masters who treasure them rather than wield them with only brute strength.
is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
thank you, i like it.
so, i've always been curious about your sword -- how the weight is distributed, what material it's made of, whether it contains any special ingenia, and what kind of sword techniques you use
so long as there remains a need for me to keep a low profile, i'm no threat to them.
i should state, i have no idea who the championship contender for this zone is, but i am pretty familiar with the mechanisms.
you are so very similar to caiyi. the more outstanding you became over the years, the more fearful i turned. i've known for a long time you were ready but i was not
ahem on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i would like to thank the crew of the express for saving the luofu from the stellaron crisis.
you want to see the skysplitter ship where the wardance will be held? let's go! i bet yunli and miss march haven't seen it either, right? well then, i'll give you all a tour.
makes my brain a little slow.
so, that's why gepard and i came up with this idea. we'd like you to help us find out what's going on!
then why exactly... do we even walk towards the light?
stop staring at me with those wary eyes!
looks like a puzzle that sparkle has left behind for you.
great! it's just the hotel is so busy, my vacation might not be long enough.
hehe, that's for sure. and you know what? the way i see it, the museum's reopening is a very significant event and worth remembering more than any other time in the past.
my "origin," huh i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
it's a shame we had to resort to this method, but we had no choice.
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
lots of children grow up learning to use a sword on the luofu, but for a child to be walking around with one
i see. the spatial ninjutsu that you displayed earlier was truly ingenious. i wouldn't be surprised if you were a memo ninja from the garden of zencollection.
and my phone definitely doesn't have enough storage so, memorizing it is the most convenient way to go.
sounds like you're speaking from experience
this lady is really something else!
relax, bro! i'm a man of my word. no need to stress out.
you aren't hiding anything, are you?
and the atmosphere here is completely different from the previous two scenes.
she ought to meet your "one we can properly speak with" requirement, right?
she seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and it's related to the watchmaker.
mm, lemme have a check
i especially love velvet coats, they're so fragile and beautiful. difficult to maintain -- you only have to be a tiny bit careless to ruin the sheen.
peace talks are over -- march, prepare for combat!
where should we start? should we go to stargazer navalia first? or the artisanship commission?
hold on, any minute now.
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
sure, when you're not passed out in fear! hehe
i've heard about what happened to you on the xianzhou, and i've got to admit, that phantylia's disguise was so perfect, it was like another me tricking everyone.
the two nameless have been honest in their answers. even though there are some tricky details, my intuition tells me there is nothing wrong.
is this the friend that you mentioned? luka? pleased to finally meet you. i keep seeing you in the news! my name is qingque, a diviner from the divination commission.
still, the outcome is uncertain. shouting loud doesn't necessarily carry any weight. what about the phone call i asked you to make, topaz?
he used an ability called "tuning" to connect our consciousnesses with his. in other words, he imprisoned us within his consciousness.
originally, we thought it was because the stellaron was linked to the destruction, but now it seems to be more than that. we might need to speak with mister yang to understand what's going on.
but do not worry, the races' organizers have designed slower courses for beginners.
let's go. i'll give you a tour of the skysplitter.
the moment of daybreak -- i've heard that's where the "dawn factory," which processes the foundation of the dreamscape, is located.
because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
then it's in your hands. elio didn't say anything about what happens next.
my intuition tells me that it would be unwise to provoke the conductor.
no problem. if we can get to the bottom of why helm master yukong no longer flies, we might be able to find out why she doesn't want you to be a fighter pilot.
i want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. it meant a lot to me.
by the time i turned around, the person had already vanished. so i handed it over to a nearby hound. i heard there were many similar reports before the charmony festival started.
we've tried repeatedly to negotiate with svarog, but he rejects every effort. he believes that wildfire is a threat. still, if it were you guys
what do you think? will you become a business advisor for aurum alley?
good example. do you know how to do the drunken swordplay?
taking care of yourself is hard enough under these circumstances, let alone if you have a brother to look after. i know it can't have been easy.
why do i keep bumping into you? are you stalking me or something?
you need the encryption key, right? which captain should i bother then?
i have recorded all the clues you provided, mister limestein. thank you for putting your trust in the silvermane guards. we will keep you informed if there are any developments in the investigation.
there, there. don't be so greedy. leave some for the other guests!
whenever i step foot aboard the express, i feel the joy of being relieved of all of my burdens.
thank you. did you find anything in the remaining footage worth paying attention to?
please take this seriously, luka!
now that you know what to do, why not give it a go? i'll be right here, waiting for you.
it's you again. who's talking to me?
i've still got this sense of foreboding. it's like we're stuck in a whirlpool -- spinning around that legacy even after everything that's happened
if an opportunity had arisen, i would have spared no effort to help him out of his predicament.
we foxians don't live as long as the xianzhou locals, but i still want to enjoy the hundred-odd years i've got left. you'd do the same in my shoes, wouldn't you?
assassins? none of us mentioned that the danger involved assassins how did you know that?
we should avoid an open conflict. let's find another path.
you let that status of yours go to your head, huh? afraid to show weakness? that's why you're keeping so much bottled up inside, right?
and it's not that i don't understand where he's coming from. i just want him to look out for himself, too!
yes. large fighter starskiffs need to be operated in pairs. one pilot takes the helm, the other controls the turrets.
if kafka is hiding in stargazer navalia, she'll have left behind traces. let's spread out and look for them -- leave no stone unturned.
i'm a firm believer in "small talk brings big clients."
of course i'll do my part, but not on the skysplitter.
i lament that we share the same weaknesses.
i know how it is alright. put that to one side for now we need to get going.
having visited the express so many times, it's only fitting i bring a token of my appreciation.
she stares at the screens. is she looking at herself in the mirror? ...what does she mean by "try again"?
she wanted me to stand next to her, but i'm glad i stuck to my guns. besides, i'm not sure i could handle that many people staring at me.
my master said: try not to think too much about what you lost -- think more about what you gained. every time i look at my arm, i remember those words.
but that dream with the masks, each more vivid than the last when i think about it, isn't that an allegory of my life?
now can you tell us what really happened to aurum alley?
i was very interested in the express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where i left them. now i can't remember anything about it.
i left so determined who would have thought that circumstances would draw me back once more?
do you still remember the "no man's land" i mentioned? i'm considering a solo trip back there during my research downtime, just to see how things are.
yep! it's not that complicated. i just wanna go a few rounds with the one everyone agrees is the most powerful in the underworld, and see where i stand. what do you say? are you interested?
we saw strange creatures outside the city they must have come from a tear in corroded space. a fragmentum, correct?
vowing to protect the underworlders in one breath, and then deciding they deserved to be abandoned in the next "family code of conduct" -- what a joke.
no. you're way too dangerous. i don't mind personally, but i don't want asta and others to take the risk.
of course you do. you can be strangers and simply walk away. but i feel you wish to help the xianzhou.
hold on. what about bronya?
having someone by my side calms me -- it's always been the case thank you.
here's your sword. keep it safe, or it might get taken away again. by the way, we haven't settled the score yet. i'll defeat you fair and square next time we fight.
i have business to attend to in the palace of astrum -- the rest is up to you. convince the old shopkeeper, and you may just become the new heroes of aurum alley.
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
please allow me to correct your statement: i never attempted to steal this weapon. as idrila's knight, i've sworn to live in poverty and possess only what is necessary.
i keep tabs on all the goings-on in aurum alley, including rumors and the latest gossip. if we can solve some of the problems in the community, it could help in rejuvenating aurum alley.
sister! i know you want madam cocolia to respond
however, when work does slow down, i may return to the parlor car to put such leisure into practice.
as for the person who employed its power it is in fact mister gopher wood, the current dreammaster.
therefore, on behalf of the merchant guild, i would like to formally extend an invitation to you all to serve as "business advisors" in the plan to save aurum alley.
i received some intel just earlier today. someone said they found clues related to a gang of thieves in the underworld's robot settlement. i don't know if they'll lead us to the sculpture, but it's worth a try.
i'm guessing you don't know about pela's mother, right?
mister svarog, you said you were willing to make all my wishes come true, right? my biggest wish right now is for everyone to work together. like like family.
but after i boarded the express, i found out that even your most ordinary everyday equipment is way more advanced than any tech i've ever seen!
the ipc representative has arrived, and i've called for miss xikui from the sky-faring commission to act as a notary.
don't worry, miss qingni. we've been in worse danger.
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
general, i've brought our guests from the express. i'm sorry for my bad timing. i didn't know you were meeting a guest, general.
i should've known don't quit your day job.
only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
where else? you think we'd leave you on svarog's turf?
um, i mean, who is this knight?
such races can be quite difficult for beginners to get a handle on.
i'm really worried about the future of penacony
as recorded in the data bank, it is customary among the vidyadhara to place one's hand on one's forehead when greeting someone. but we don't need to do that.
fyxestroll garden is full of abnormalities -- even the ten-lords commission cannot guarantee your safety. i suggest you leave immediately.
i just bumped into himeko. we got chatting, and, well i never knew she was such an expert.
quick as lightning, always keeping her word -- that was her way of doing things. back then i thought we'd be friends for life.
i encountered a patrol officer named lujun before. it was a few weeks ago when we were transporting the borisin prisoners.
i hope you have an amazing journey, serval. do remember to visit home when you get the chance.
so, one of my answers will be true, the other will be false. as for which is which, that's up to the asker to make the call
i know about the stellaron. it's exactly what the fugitives behind you are seeking. but the madam guardian has already revealed the truth to me! these people have ulterior motives, serval. they want to steal this treasure from the architects.
but i trust there are still a few factions that remain exceptions, and that's why i need you all. the reputation of the astral express precedes you, and the harmony will give you the fairest of appraisals.
i can't help but say that after arriving on the express, i'm a little envious of your way of life. you are able to enjoy the vastness of the universe, and with reliable companions by your side.
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
that path may have been more ordinary and challenging, but now he's in a comatose state, and the "sweet dream" has become a sort of end-of-life care. his fate is sealed.
no, no, she's got skill alright, i can tell she's got training.
the underworld has been struggling, but i never tried to help. i didn't even know that it was my own home that had fallen into such a dire state
hmm, it looks like your team isn't complete yet
hatching rebirths are specific to the vidyadhara can humans also experience de-aging?
really? so i don't even need to write a resignation letter?
when you were abandoned in the wild and near your end, i showed you a way to survive and helped you escape the jaws of death.
...mister yang, before answering that question, i wish to continue the previous topic.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
since i was a kid, it's been clear to me that not everyone deserves to have a weapon in their hands. giving them a sword is no different than being cruel to the innocent.
i can't say for certain, but with you on board, our chances have greatly increased.
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides
the intelligentsia guild assigned me to be an invigilator for the ipc's ambassadors. hmph, nothing more than an errand from the office of academic affairs.
and adler already discovered the relationship between spontaneous human combustion and the phase flame through the concept of "energy lifeforms."
oh am i understanding this correctly? a masked fool, inviting me to work together?
i've heard about himeko of the astral express -- my colleagues were gossiping about how beautiful and knowledgeable she is. if i ever get the chance, i'd love to meet her.
i see it too -- let's go.
yunli, please go for now.
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
looks like the hidden dregs have finally come to the surface. and as i said before, it's time to wash them away, once and for all.
the xianzhou is reluctant to involve outsiders in the stellaron disaster, so why is it so keen on letting us capture a stellaron hunter?
although this small robot appears to want to communicate, its speech is all scrambled
mingxi, please ready your questions.
you know the way to the great mine, right? let's catch up with gepard when you're ready!
i i was born and raised here.
and that's precisely why i haven't been able to shake off this strange feeling in the days since i started traveling with you.
hm if i hadn't moved away when i did, i'd probably be where they are right now.
great, great! it's a real treat to see so many talented young people around here today.
ahem of course, i trust that such an important article will not be used for trivial or inappropriate circumstances. i hope you can understand
look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
asters are a type of plant that release a unique scent -- barely noticeable to humans. however, numby is extremely sensitive to it -- look!
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
little gui, this is official business -- it's nothing like the street fights we're always dealing with. you can stop being so excited
am i really that important to someone? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories
i'm afraid more than trust will be destroyed here.
so he can forget about it for now!
jing yuan, is it not time you sent me to the xuling?
only a very few people in belobog know of the existence of the stellaron. those that do would never associate it with the fragmentum or eternal freeze.
i'm really sorry, but i have to leave for a short while death still hovers about, and i must personally ensure miss himeko and miss march seventh's safety, and warn them
that would explain why mister sunday has been having such difficulty in catching the traitor.
but misha can see clockie, too, right? they even grew up together, but misha hasn't started the way of the trailblaze yet
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
it's time to see if you're as strong as she says you are!
oh right, i remember mentioning something after that... what was it again?
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
i'm not sure. she hasn't left qlipoth fort. the supreme guardian just said she'd returned. nothing more.
well, i'll be on my way then. i wish you and your friends a happy today, a happy tomorrow, and a happy day after that!
i heard there's something called a stellaron in madam herta's collection.
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
to my understanding, the family's harmony and prosperity have never relied on so-called "divine laws"
should we really be charging over there? even without a heliobus, yanqing is a swordsmaster among swordsmasters.
the general already has a lot on his plate. as his retainer, it's my duty to share the burden
yeah, sure. why should i object? not only this sample, but all the goods on the transport ship are yours to keep. like i said, we won't inspect them.
i've only smelled something this sweet and enticing once, when i was little.
ah, we see each other pretty often -- usually it's me running away and him running after me. gotta say, i'm gradually beginning to enjoy the attention, hehe.
so you're the general's cook?
what a dismal sight. this district have you been here before?
but then again how can i blame you? i mean, i caught you off guard. it had to happen -- you could even say i deserved it, huh? besides, i've made a gallant group of new friends as a result, hehe
that young swordmaster has a keen eye and a swift hand, but i have no desire to compete with anyone in a sword fight.
i'm good, everything seems normal
yikes, enough already. don't make a spectacle.
as nanook's followers, they stand against all life and civilization and execute the will of destruction, disseminating chaos and calamity.
if you know nothing about martial arts, why were you smirking earlier?
that's exactly what i had in mind! nobody knows who's gonna come out on top! it could be me, could be someone else it'll probably be me, but whatever happens it won't be him!
he's just surprised that it has resurfaced.
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
thanks for stepping in, general feixiao. otherwise, i'd have had to knock them out with my incense.
i tested it so many times just to make sure and now that i finally boarded the express, it doesn't even work. oh well, luckily, i brought along some sparklers too!
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
as you can see, i've only returned to my home to bid it farewell. would you be kind enough to give me a chance to say goodbye so that i may leave without regrets?
but the smarter ones wouldn't have joined the game in the first place. see? i'm smarter.
has anyone ever told you that you're more like a detective than a memokeeper?
why are the bad guys always using good swords why can't the bad guys take bad swords?
speaking of champions -- have you heard the story of the mysterious "elite player?"
come on, i need to look around a bit more before i can be sure
the luofu has enjoyed centuries of stability since the end of the sedition of imbibitor lunae, much of which can be attributed to general jing yuan's masterful strategizing.
my guess is that they attribute their suffering to their decision to renounce the path of the plagues author. thus, they seek to save themselves by becoming denizens of abundance again.
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now
you promised me, qingni! we shall discuss this when we return.
this place is the rift between dream and reality. a place reserved only for those who have awakened from ena's dream.
welcome to bonajade exchange, radiant feldspar branch.
because our shared goals give equal weight to the beliefs we strive for.
actually, i'm simply using the authority granted by the xianzhou people to let you return to the tournament. you don't need my recognition at all, or anyone else's.
seven hundred years ago, i didn't have the chance to help his home. but it's still not too late for me to step in.
listen to me, gepard! the origin and spread of the fragmentum is linked to the stellaron. the meteorite in the architects' records, it's--
whoa, whoa, stay cool, seele. like i said, i'm thinking clearly. every word i said is serious!
it's all thanks to the eternal freeze. we can eat raw fish from seven hundred years ago!
you claim to be our companion, so it's only reasonable to ask that you state your identity and purpose.
hmm? are you writing a letter, miss march?
we can set out at any time. just come find me when you're ready~
yeah, whenever he came back, he'd place a logbook on the bookshelf in his room. they contain records of his expeditions to every corner of the world.
it was the last time i spoke to caiyi.
you've been running so many errands lately -- i'd like for you to take some useful items away with you.
ah, then he probably didn't describe the scene in detail.
the remains of the swarm author?
miss gui has set up a social media account under the guise of investigating paranormal phenomena and unexplained mysteries we can use it to gather intel for our mission.
beautiful beings, are you disciples?
well, the healer lady couldn't do anything about my condition. she just told me to "enjoy some tasty food."
in fact, by way of thanks, i'd like to invite you to the palace of astrum for tea. it is about time we knew each other better.
no no, after all they've brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. i just feel like i'm starting to understand them less and less
restricted area? since when were you in charge of fyxestroll garden?
come with me -- we'll go find them. you come along too.
the strategic investment department comprises the ipc's most elite employees, many of whom can be very forceful.
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor
the emotionless, soulless, and merciless evil ninja osaru.
before i joined the stellaron hunters, the nature of my work meant that i barely ever saw the same person twice.
mm-hmm, pretty accurate nickname, right? that guy has a lot on his plate -- it's enough to make you worry.
having witnessed this spectacle... i am sure you will come to grasp the depth of my convictions.
yeah, then let's check out the rooms i just mentioned.
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
uh-oh, someone's getting a little emotionally overinvested
huh? what's wrong with that? everyone around here knows the way i work
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
as a silvermane guard, i observe the oath not because i fear to go against it, but because i am obliged to uphold it.
of course! the deadline has already passed, but bronya still hasn't signed the contract. i think i can guess what's holding her back
looks like nothing can be found here.
the ipc is eager to reclaim penacony, so their presence here is not unexpected.
i apologize for my tardiness, once again.
it's a nice feeling just like the one i had before.
we're still preparing the starskiff for the ceremony. please, everyone, come back to me when your work is complete.
garden of gourmet. you two deserve a treat.
miss march, i would advise you to refrain from interfering with the vidyadhara.
show me robin first.
this is all but a fleeting dream, one of the thousands of manifestations of ix... under the watchful eye of nihility, we momentarily linger here, before moving on to our own paths.
before coming here, i had all sorts of scenarios in my head about dealing with the family i did not expect an empty mansion
i feel sorry for this world. first the stellaron, and now you
i knew there was a workshop in this town, so i wanted to try my luck here. i found all the components i need, but then i ran into a monster
uh hah, good question! so, actually, we're affiliated with the ten--
i'm going to count down from ten. if you do not come out, i will destroy the ship.
yes, that's what i was talking about something strange has happened.
most exhibits in this museum are of little value.
rest assured, asta only had a fright. she is recovering in the clinic.
and perhaps the grownups among us could refrain from acting like children?
it's just a guess, but there are also some footprints on the ground here.
these are all relics, sis. please don't touch them. what if you break something?
hm, true. let me check a few bottles.
a story for another time. as host of the dreamscape, do you have any suggestions for fixing this problem?
not all of the vidyadhara harbor evil intentions. if you feel uneasy, dragon lady, the seat of divine foresight can arrange for you to stay elsewhere.
uh thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.
well, it looks like everything's finally in order. i suppose it's time to head back?
the stellaron? but how is that possible? penacony is a free-flowing interstellar hub. there are no signs of contamination whatsoever.
it's guarding the ambrosial arbor's roots and the furnace.
let me say it again: the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
yes, more specifically the xianzhou luofu.
oh, you've come along, too, mister dan heng.
conceal your form and hide your intentions, don't fall for their distractions.
oh, that's right! you're already a part of the express making new friends is what it's all about.
let's disembark here, benefactors.
they hold claim to this debt for all time. the great battle between general teng xiao and ignamar was fought largely for this reason.
but they also knew that cassidy could fix little fay, and use its tracker function to find big ben the thief must have tossed the broken drone somewhere and only made off with big ben.
since i do rock 'n' roll full-time, i'd say my hobby is work? what's wrong with that?
we are most grateful, miss sushang.
it's about time we were on our way.
a distress call method regularly used by the nameless.
not that i'm doubting your skill, but i'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself in the process.
hold on a second that's obviously a chemistry problem.
okay, let's see what there is.
the supreme guardian has briefed me on the situation and asked that i assist you in locating topaz.
oh, that's a letter i was gonna send to my mom. i haven't even finished writing it.
ahem all my talk of former days is rather spoiling the atmosphere. my apologies.
unsheathing this sword without merit is to blaspheme the divine will of the reignbow arbiter, and invite calamity.
he became a galaxy ranger by accident and spent many long years traveling among the stars. he encountered countless fascinating individuals and saw wonders witnessed by few.
and? what's wrong with a quick route, hmm?
maybe if i had made a small change in my childhood, i would have turned out to be exactly like him.
this guy is really into these puppets.
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
a hard bed is good for your spine. a bed that's too soft will end up hurting you.
when you think about it, it's just another part of the cycle of life.
hmm... i ended it with a period. it was a statement, not a threat.
huh? oh, uh let me think "hey sis, the energy supply lines in the restricted zone have malfunctioned. those useless engineers can't find the problem." something like that
i will if i have the time.
yes, this is the last chance to investigate the cartridge data.
the sky-faring commission has reserved rooms for you at the petrichor inn. when you finish your business here, how about some tea together?
*sigh* i understand. well, this photo will always be close to my heart. i'll make a copy for you too, clara.
i can't say that i know her, but she does look a little familiar. is she a guest of the general's?
i try to be inconspicuous when i'm on patrol. that way, i can avoid disturbing the researchers while they work and observe their utmost concentration.
you and dan heng make good points. i'll throw in a vote for edo star too.
don't forget, she's on the ipc's most-wanted list -- a fugitive that nobody can seem to pin down and now we've become her prey while she stalks us in the shadows.
how's the journey been? if there's something weighing you down, let me do a little divination for you
rest and recuperation aside, don't forget pom-pom's request. the conductor has done plenty for us, and it's time to return that favor.
it seems neither the dreammaster of penacony nor this old oti is happy with sunday's recent performance.
huh? you don't agree with my methods? hmm, but it's already too late. moze has already taken care of things.
even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. there are countless things that humans cannot change.
it eludes me, but there's a known semblance in the memory zone, mirroring the essence she radiates what reason does she have to delve so deep into the dreamscape?
do not try to emulate that gambler's penchant for attempting to be overly clever. i'll let it go this time, but this won't happen again.
what's this a plush toy?
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy it must mean we're doing something right.
i have a feeling that with you, i can pick up the lost threads and dispel my uncertainties.
of course! this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- i can't miss it.
he said so? hmm considering the spatial obstacles that the star rail has encountered, it's highly possible.
"be eager to help those in need and do one good deed a day" i like to practice what i preach, but i never thought we'd accomplish so much.
wanna hear the truth? i'm afraid great ambitions and lofty plans no longer hold much appeal for an old-timer like me.
i see that's a pity. have you considered starting one?
don't be afraid. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall is of great help to the garden.
so you guys aren't that close after all? i thought you were sworn friends.
i'm honored. i've also been raring to witness the strength of the legendary luka strongarm.
so, you're saying even though grandpa knew it was a cursed sword, he still chose it to be a prize because he thought it wouldn't cause any trouble?
oh? well then i'll give you a chance. defeat me, or hand over all your swords.
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation
yet you will repay this favor all the same. after all, you're only alive today because of me. you owe me that much.
hold on, i i'll be there soon.
of course not! what were you thinking?
y'know missy, you sure know how to bear a grudge.
my lady, if i may, i wish to perform a tuning on you.
i'll say it again. i don't care what ruan mei said to you, but there's no chance we're shutting down the simulated universe!
they fell into a spatial curio and could not leave until the department of ecology's most knowledgeable curio expert solved it from within.
just stay cool! let me think of something got it!
a lot of the data is corrupted, but even the residual pieces contain huge amounts of information that we're struggling to process. i'm trying to sort them out.
however, even though svarog is no longer sealing off the furnace core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
as i expected. before you came, whenever march wanted to go anywhere, himeko would make mister yang and me go with her.
bring it down. we need to cover the retreat.
rivet town is only at the outstretched fingertips of the corrosion now, we're deep in the fragmentum's heart.
i don't blame her. i got excited when i heard people arguing at the dock and the rest is history.
hmm why won't it
you misunderstand. if you were in my shoes right now, wouldn't you want to keep your guard up~?
no need to worry, the majority of the ipc's employees are quite professional -- wouldn't dream of tarnishing their company's reputation.
thank you for the concern, but i'm fine~ the general commanded me to stay with you -- i dare not go against military orders.
when i first heard the news, i was definitely proud, but also a little concerned
general, do you know about igor's experience on the xianzhou?
it's a very long story, so let's deal with the problem at hand first.
he must be a fan of this book too i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
as for how many floors there are? well, not even us judges know for sure.
no wonder i kept smelling that familiar stench. so, it wasn't just my imagination. do your thing, moze!
i didn't catch all the details, but i do remember seeing him forge those amazing swords while the visitors watched with smiles on their faces. i used to believe that craftsmen brought happiness to others.
just lemme know when you're ready and we can head over together!
but with such a large group, it's inevitable that troublemakers will find their way in. they've been stealing from the miners and picking fights. and that's not the worst of it.
but as a suspect, shouldn't i be bound and interrogated in the shackling prison? is it really appropriate to bring me to a place like this, general?
if crushing our enemies was as easy as breathing for the reignbow arbiter then what purpose did our sacrifices serve?
i want to be like her when i grow up so i can protect everyone and protect mister svarog!
hmm, let's keep moving. the person i was looking for isn't here
there's gotta be a better shot than this one!
however there's a problem that needs to be resolved before it can open to the public.
moreover mister gopher wood has been kind to my sister and me, and i didn't want it all to end like this.
you're a member of the express crew, dan heng. let's settle this matter as soon as possible -- our journey doesn't end here.
as such, i came to the conclusion that the communication must have been an attempt by the stellaron hunters to sow dissent between us.
present company is gathered to reiterate the xianzhou luofu's esteemed gratitude for the magnanimous actions of the nameless.
alas, this place is a bit of a mixed bag -- plenty of "characters." keep your wits about you, friends. don't let anyone deceive you.
hmm i'm not sure if anyone sells this kind of thing, however
sushang is very kind and comes to my shop every day to ask: "is business difficult? i'll help you!" "did anyone smash your shop? i'll help you!"
good answer! the tournament is about to begin, so i must go carry out the mission that grandpa gave me.
the signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
the alchemy commission members examined them and found some unusual structures within.
they're already awake in their rooms. will you be comfortable in following me now? time waits for no one. we must hurry to the lobby.
have you ever heard of cursed swords? that sword is one.
madam, forgive me. i had no idea about anything she said -- as you saw, i went through a brain scan and everything.
as a nameless, the express still needs me.
this is my bargaining chip for negotiating with the higher-ups. i'll convince them that jarilo-vi has a place in the company's long-term strategies.
boring. i'm changing the directions of this scene. cast member of the family, that's a wrap for you.
well, the part that shocked me the most was about the aeons.
elio only gave me one instruction: allow the astral express to pursue the grand legacy. it means that the watchmaker's legacy holds great significance to trailblazing, and to you.
if she can delegate more resources to the investigation, that should help it move forward faster.
haha, don't drink too much, or you won't be able to sleep tonight.
let's light them up! look! aren't they nice!
herta was probably impulsive and added the cartridge into the simulation without telling anyone, resulting in the item being listed as lost.
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
"when you see it you'll scream!" that's so cliche, with the arrow and everything "failed your starskiff pilot test? you're cursed!" tsk, people are always looking for excuses
i thought you knew... didn't you say you had me pegged?
huh, i guess it's time we got our act together.
and the very place where the future of penacony shall be determined through conflict.
this button says "system reset." let's give it a try.
i saw you the day before the goethe hotel. gepard took you to see mo-- the supreme guardian. he told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
a warm reminder, benefactors, that the artisanship commission is as important to the xianzhou as the divination commission.
are we not outsiders here, miss sushang?
the seat of divine foresight heard that yukong's seldom-seen but often-feared temper was on display. i believe the two of you were caught between mother and daughter?
i hope to be able to drink and talk freely with you once again when everything is settled.
i wish it were made up unfortunately it's all true.
since i'm returning to the xianzhou, i think it's better to choose something unrelated to the alliance. feel free to pick a few for me.
you want to come as well? but you look quite tired.
alright, enough chinwagging. so, how much did the microfilm sell for?
you know what's even more of a waste? your experiment's on its way to failure.
nope. apart from this boring festival, i have no dealings with the man.
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
when we run into kafka, we'll do the fighting -- and the capturing for that matter. thank you for showing us the way.
while i know a thing or two about swordplay, in a proper duel like this, a knight should rely on the skills he's honed day and night.
who knows? she tends to make decisions based on the results of her divinations as opposed to what others might be thinking.
hey, there's something engraved inside the ring: "zhongshan family heirloom"
it's a long story but, at least mister sunday took it easy on us.
...and that is why i boarded the express with velite. i am hoping to solve this crisis with you.
ugh, where's the pin? is there anything those vagrants won't steal?
yeah, that's true. of course, i want things to be resolved peacefully, but aren't we getting stuck in rigid formalities here?
huh? you just said you didn't wanna complicate things for me, and now you're sending me on a mission
actually, we're not really unauthorized, are we, judge?
can you identify the people who left these footprints?
i remember seeing a picture of a depth crawler in my childhood -- i insisted to my parents that we had to go and see them my parents told me how they had been extinct for thousands of years.
people here must have felt abandoned by the guards after the passage was sealed off. if we were to simply "take over" the underworld in the name of the supreme guardian i can only imagine how people would react.
i didn't expect to see someone his age still using a sword as a toy from generation to generation, it seems some things never change.
it wasn't too long. seeing your enthusiasm for this "celestial jade" game has stoked my curiosity.
come now, friends. i can understand the mistrust, but there's no need for the charade.
oh, did my smart-reply function tell you where i was? it's a system developed by the technology department. pretty neat, right?
but before that, on the road towards the end, there are still many things that we can do.
you guys can hang around here, but don't run off too far -- there'll be cloud knights coming to escort you back soon. bye for now!
i heard a few versions of the story from cloud knights who were there. the number of wolftroopers went from a few dozen to thousands, and the number keeps rising. it's becoming more absurd by the minute!
talking? i just hear white noise
once again, thank you for being kind to me. i wish you a great time in the dream, and i shall not interrupt your... date?
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
mm, i'm sure.
i see then you'll have to speak with gallagher. but he's currently busy hosting a visitor from the oak family, and specifically asked not to be disturbed.
miss robin, may i stay here with you to gaze at the stars, before the show begins?
let's go. we need to get to the wardance ring!
take me to the one who knows the most about curios within the department of ecology, if you would be so kind.
in your opinion, what does this "deja vu" mean?
oh you brave and fearless trailblazers, you benevolent nameless, can you really remain indifferent to that?
the boss he appeared suddenly after the guards were redeployed, and became a major player in the underworld.
that's the reason i asked for you to come here. i need your advice.
even though i lacked the talent to pilot the starskiff and wasn't much of a warrior, i still chose to travel around with the merchant guild.
the memokeeper on the express
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh inconvenient situation.
right, and as i mentioned, that fantasy raiment of yours doesn't exist.
no wonder aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone -- the ipc can't back him up in the dreamscape.
since you do not understand the beauty, i will have to show you in a way that only a knight can.
let's ignore the fact that you understand insect-speak for now. that sentence
i know when danger will come and what form it will take. don't worry, together we can do this -- no harm will come to you.
apparently, they used to be good friends well, good friends who were bad for each other. bladie forgot nearly everything, so he doesn't remember it well.
still, i bet there's still a chance for kids like hook and clara, right? who knows, maybe they'll be able to represent belobog as it returns to the arms of the universe!
svarog claims to be a guardian of humanity -- all the ownerless robots obey his commands. they've occupied the furnace core hub, and they're not letting anyone get close.
as for the harmony, my stance remains the same. whether it's you or the paths, if what i once doubted -- or even opposed -- becomes the force i must rely on in the future
your kindness is much appreciated, miss qingque. as for celestial jade, we'll have to leave it for next time.
i want to spend some time honing my skills then, when the time's right, you can take me down, and we'll see what the masters of this snowy planet can do.
whether it be for competition or for joy, they leave a trail in the places they visit. one symbol after another link up to become a long, long journey that writes the game of life.
they glimmer with such brilliance. it's really hard to determine. i wonder if there is some way to appraise the authenticity of the seeds and rainbowite? perhaps right here on the express?
i have something else for you also: an aether expansion chip. integrating its data into an aether spirit will grant them new, innate abilities.
did helm master yukong never bring this up with you?
the flame we witnessed claimed to be lord ravager phantylia -- a name i've heard other nameless speak of in the past.
you know something, gepard? that guitar case in your hand, and my guitar they're both from the same prototype -- the "super electromagnetic flux player."
ahh, i haven't been here for a while -- it's nice to be back in the old stomping ground.
well, the situation here is pretty similar to when you first arrived. it's just that instead of a few thugs and broken robots, now we're dealing with much more formidable adversaries.
no, you do not have to. this is merely an unspoken rule for battles between knights. i apologize. we, the knights of beauty, hope to convince people through battle, not poetry...
well, well, someone's feeling pretty confident
this is one of the places mentioned in the riddle -- one of the three talons. if we can break the seal here, we'll be a step closer to the roots of the arbor.
so the corrosion is inside the city that's a grave situation.
photo? this feels like one of my fan meet-ups, haha. anyway, for you guys, i'd do autographs for free.
see? see? how can you compete with me? i'll teach march seventh the essence of zhuming swordplay, so she can win the contest with my sword skills.
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
if elder huaiyan accepts the explanation, so do i.
there's no need to be modest! the most important thing about consumer relations is the bond between us. i hope everyone will continue to support our work in the future!
it's probably an isolated glitch.
our first priority is finding the thief and recovering the stolen item, but we don't even have a suspect yet that's why this case is such a conundrum for the silvermane guards.
connect the cycrane to your phone to control it remotely. use it to find the crash, and hurry.
another vessel in our vicinity encountered the same obstruction and was unable to control its velocity. after the collision, two individuals found their way onto the express.
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control f--from the bridge, i mean.
hehe i, too, wished to go with you. but himeko insisted on letting you and your friends rise to the challenge.
whether it's driving starskiffs or leading the sky-faring commission, madam yukong is always present in the xianzhou's course. i'm still lacking in my skills as a helmswoman.
pela and i are probably the only ones in the world who know how to handle her oh, and that assistant of hers too -- molly.
march is curious about everything, and she's always getting me to do combat poses. she thinks i pull them off pretty well, apparently. you think so too? hmm
there will be numerous contests and celebrations during the wardance, and the main event will be the ringmaster's challenge.
you've got style with those moves, but you're not striking where it counts. it's such a shame to see you misuse your sword like that.
you think you look alike?
well, there's never been a human that could accommodate a stellaron in their body.
it's also my way of saying farewell to tingyun. i know, i'm selfish. she may not have died a cloud knight, but she's still one of us here at the sky-faring commission -- a victim caught up in a wider conflict.
you are my most trusted aide, and there are some things that i would only assign to you. speaking of which, yanqing
the mind is mysterious i've lived for more than two hundred years, forgotten nearly every conversation i've ever had but i still remember us shooting the breeze that day -- it's crystal clear.
mhm, make sure you never forget about it.
only to mom. you know i still don't get along with dad.
the way i see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection
thank you. i must apologize for the trouble my daughter has brought you.
greetings, my honored preceptor. it's been a while since we last touched base. i've brought a friend with me today. i believe you're already familiar with each other.
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too
but if what you say is true... in the name of beauty, let us use this fated duel to test your mettle!
well, well, looks like someone's finally seeing sense.
so you admit that the merchant guild mismanaged the dock.
the feeling of boarding the express and seeing everyone again is simply indescribable.
hmmm i say that's a good title. what does everyone think? alrighty then, it's decided.
why are you two always so quiet?
darn, i wanted to see one
this isn't something the healers at the alchemy commission can handle. i'll take huohuo back to the ten-lords commission -- perhaps they'll have an answer.
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
oh, really? i'm sorry to hear that.
are you saying that march seventh can actually take down an aurumaton from the artisanship commission with a sword? come on, an aurumaton is no match for our state-of-the-art mechs!
why does luka always come sneaking back into town like this?
i want to let you enjoy this firsthand experience, hee-hee.
hmm you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet
those cloud knights said they were just ordinary soldiers they were tough as heck, and yet they are just the luofu's most ordinary fighters
march, a--as much as i enjoyed your deduction, i do have a few questions.
well, that's not up to me dig in. i called you here so you could enjoy the food.
looks normal enough on the surface let's take a closer look.
we also defeated an ancient robot known as "svarog," and learned some truths about the stellaron.
velite, i will escort you to your destination. a knight always keeps his word.
you probably still can! want to give it a try?
got it! it's definitely sturdier now nice job, lynxy!
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya
from what we've gathered, the influence of the stellaron can still be contained.
it seems you have something on your mind. let's hear it. i'd like to hear a fresh perspective myself hehe, as talkative as himeko is, we've pretty much run out of topics.
i'm not certain yet but there's more to our "friend" here than meets the eye.
the skit this time is a modernist one.
ah? oh, yes, that's right
the dock is undergoing an unscheduled safety inspection. it would be best if you took care of other urgent issues first.
and now, i will reclaim everything i have lost. and it should begin with a proper acknowledgment--
haha, quit worrying sushang, you've been an awesome squad member! and a very talented sleepyhead.
and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
hmm, good idea. the everyday vibe of the aurum alley is a rare find on the planet of festivities.
just between you and me, i think declining the offers was a smart choice.
what's the rush, chicken wing boy? did i get to you?
signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." for most of the residents here, especially those in the underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
the foxians curse his name day and night, and they even use it to scare children into staying quiet. how could they grant a swift death to such a great sinner?
you want to create a situation where all three parties are present?
help you? hmm, that's interesting. i was under the impression you'd already decided to obstruct our operations here.
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
not at all, the analysis of an aficionado. i wouldn't take my word for it.
hehe, conversing with you is truly a delightful experience.
that way i won't have to hide behind mister svarog anymore.
what? five hundred thousand!? no offense kid, but i can't see you haggling that kinda number
hehe, well, seeing as you're so confident, let's give your idea a try.
i'll fight for this opportunity for you, bronya. i shouldn't have conflated your own circumstances with my childhood. that was a serious lapse of judgment on my part.
as for aligning with me, see the truth first, then decide... you'll still have time.
let's get going, miss. careful -- take your time.
if i'm right, this conference is probably just a prelude. whoever organized it wants to assess the ipc's stance beforehand.
i think the guards must have done this intentionally.
i almost feel bad for him. aurum alley's enemy should be the ipc, not the president.
belobog's weapon testing ground -- at least it was seven hundred years ago.
i bought these shoes for you -- i remember the size and the design. this is undoubtedly your footprint.
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
this area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. i guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
these days i just spend my time fixing things in this workshop and playing music. it's a pretty carefree existence.
detonating a stellaron... i can't do it. the aventurine stone is too broken to even safeguard my escape from the stage.
if we circumvent clara and the gate, svarog will only identify us as intruders. he'll be even more likely to give us the cold shoulder.
their so-called "immortality" is just a facade. i mean, nothing can truly defy death, can it? i just don't understand why the luofu kept this tumor for so long, leading to the terrible situation we're facing now.
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
they say that many years ago, madam yukong was an ace pilot in the cloud knights. she was a "work hard, play harder" type, known for her hot temper and incredible skill.
reminds me of me and my brother -- sort of a love-hate relationship.
there's something wrong with the stuff this guy is shipping -- it's causing damage to other people's goods, and our dock here is liable for the compensation
so, you think richard was the one who stole my encryption key?
i'm worried that he still holds some grudge against me. but to be honest, i'd love to have another spar with him.
*sigh* don't worry, i won't dig too deep. i know bronya must have thought long and hard before deciding what to make public.
since you're so curious, i'll give you the whole story.
what kind of sword training will you do today? do you wish for me to accompany you?
understood. we won't put you out of your comfort zone, miss tingyun.
you misunderstand. thanks to the ten lords' blessing, my sister turned into an ingenium centuries ago. dying and returning as just a soul to the hall of karma's document office has become a routine for her.
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
me? have we met?
long-range communication technology is still improving. perhaps the presence of the stellaron is affecting signal transmission.
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
well, my granddaughter was inspired by the heroic legends told by the miekka kivessa, so she dragged me here to take a look.
many xianzhou comrades who were lucky enough to survive the wars became stricken with mara -- a condition that immortals are susceptible to.
that tinge of regret i sense ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories i cherish.
we'll have to cut the banter short let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
but this thing in front of us is our enemy! it was born out of the evil gathered in the fragmentum! you won't get answers from it!
you mean to say that you don't trust me completely?
so they can talk after all! miss black swan, they're heading straight for you
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
i don't think we're in a position to take down this deer until we've dealt with its regenerative abilities
yes, they are waiting in the dragonvista rain hall.
i'm ready, svarog! we can start any time!
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
her again? sparkle really is obsessed with scripting her own death.
the ambrosial arbor was severed long ago, but it is not dead. if there is any activity from the denizens of abundance, it will be connected to the arbor.
i feel a bit better then. i was worried i spoke out of turn or upset him.
records from heron express show that this container was sent by a person named "a-feng." what do you have to say about that?
yes, yes, yes i have to go now -- i'll leave this in your overwhelmingly capable hands, fu xuan.
even the toughest long-life species would have a hard time enduring this.
you think? i really like it. i'm not good at it though -- silver wolf always manages to guess right.
sadly a lot of our researchers get shoulder and neck pain -- they're sat at their desks most of the day.
well, seeing as we've come this far
clearing out some abominations? meh, sounds boring.
that was the most suitable way of describing the galaxy rangers in my interpretation.
maybe the emotions of organic lifeforms are an expression of data, don't you think?
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
your analysis is accurate. however, in my humble opinion, now may not be the best time to call the harmony shogunate for aid.
but general, the situation inside is still chaotic and perilous. your presence would be
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch
let's go and meet them. we won't know until we're down there.
i never imagined that something i learned about unexpectedly would become the key to connecting everything.
everything. they keep the peace, uphold justice, fight for resources, distribute goods
why did you choose to bring the order to penacony? wouldn't it have been better to choose a desperate world instead of a city filled with hope and dreams? why?
stellarons, huh? ask away, i'm listening.
qingque, i've been thinking through the calculations for this puzzle -- there really is only one solution.
lately, many children have come to ask me how to become a captain *sigh* to be honest, the best advice i can give is to keep training and have a balanced diet.
apart from the incense that helps you sleep, there's also something i trust you will like.
i have the right to remain silent.
if that's true, the only way to get a wider perspective is to leave my comfort zone and look outward. the answer to reviving aurum alley isn't necessarily within the alley itself
in any case, since you remember what happened just now well, that's put my mind at ease.
it should be a view i tire of seeing, but it always leaves me in awe the heavens really are boundless.
that's right. cassidy sent us here! hand over what you stole, or be prepared to face the fist of a champion!
you two should head over to natasha's place and check in on the wounded.
really? so my guess was correct.
exquisite reasoning, and very close to the truth but i have another answer. would you like to hear it?
yes, we saw one in serval's workshop.
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
your appetite astounds me, but it seems you didn't eat anything that might affect your brain.
upon ingesting the brumedew concentrate pellet, you will feel the limitless freedom of the form bestowed upon you by merciful medicus
what will kafka have to say to you? i'm curious to find out myself.
when everyone's rested and ready, let's go through the leads. time to find another heliobus.
he often said that those moments felt like returning to his family's side, and the difficulties at sea didn't seem quite as challenging.
quite the contrary. i should be the one thanking you.
yes... this is my wish.
he knows how to keep his identity hidden, and his sources are fast and reliable i guess he found out about mister norbert's arrest and made a run for it.
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
i hope his memory bank really does contain data on the stellaron.
attachment, desire, longing... they may all be right, but they are all incomplete.
well, life and death, jiaoqiu, it's all predetermined.
you've earned my respect.
maybe that's true. a boxer does need to take in a lot more energy than the average person. hahaha.
when the life of a vidyadhara is over, they return to the ancient sea and form a shell, before emerging anew. this is the hatching rebirth cycle.
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
the alchemy commission and scalegorge waterscape delves are adjacent to the ambrosial arbor's seal. i'd like you to investigate these places.
if you want my take, he prevented another underworld conflict, even if the execution was rough around the edges.
however, since you are now a member of the squad, and in the interest of everyone working together, it's best that we know each other a little better -- i'll tell you some of the secrets i know.
in other words, you and i are each other's destiny.
the only thing worth saying is: old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
mister yang mentioned the express' next voyage is to send a passenger back home. could this lady be from the xianzhou alliance?
we worshiped idrila, the aeon of beauty. we vowed to guard their beauty with the sword, but one day they suddenly disappeared.
periodically stirring up trouble is part of their tradition entire buildings vanishing into thin air, puppet riots -- you get the picture.
it symbolizes a chance to introduce ourselves to the cosmos once again -- a heroic kingdom that survived both the legion and the eternal freeze with tenacity.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
i said, why haven't you left?
those travelers who came seeking hanguang's swords all came in the name of justice and honor.
i'm feixiao, general of the xianzhou yaoqing. now that we're acquainted, should the astral express run into any trouble, feel free to contact me. the yaoqing will be there in an instant.
hmm, let's leave the slogan to mingxi. we should head to the next location.
come with me, we need to check the engine room! it's the heart of the ship, so we need to prioritize its safety!
stay calm. asta was merely teleported -- her life was not in danger.
seems like a love poem to me.
he looks like a skilled fighter, the covert kind. he has large palms, yet his fingers are slender and nimble. i reckon he has experience using knives, like a short sword or dagger
fine, let's finish up here. but i'm gonna put it out there -- we're not gonna forget those lines of yours anytime soon
i remember the xianzhou was a sight to behold. good luck.
your testimony went out the window the second you started being secretive.
and so when he learned this piece of information, he realized that the victim had created their own locked-room mystery.
your understanding is more precious than any treasure. i have faced many a traveler, encountered flattery and provocation aplenty. it is rare to find a spirit as pure as yours.
i knew you'd come. when we first mentioned the xianzhou, there was a sad look in your eyes.
that gears and wisdom sculpture i told you to take apart and hide away can you remind me how many pieces it had?
you removed me from the shackling prison and decided to interrogate me here but not for security purposes. you wish to discuss things that shouldn't be overheard.
unfortunately, i didn't have time to ask the craftsman to customize the swords for you, but i did my best to choose ones that look nice and are suitable for a beginner. i hope you like them, miss march.
but looking back, haven't you learned something more important than just swordplay?
i just couldn't believe that he never lifted a finger to oppose cocolia's order to seal the passageway
when i shut my eyes, i get this feeling that i'm among the stars.
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
my apologies, miss silver wolf, but none of what you are hoping for will be happening today. you may leave now.
look at how bustling this ship is, not bad! someday when i'm less tied up, i plan to host a grand party on my eco-ship, and you'll be on the guest list.
if we really want to do this right though, it's the thought behind the gift that truly matters. the more thought goes into the gift, the better the recipient feels it.
still, it'd be nice if those kids would stop littering it's barely lunchtime and i've already picked up three half-eaten packs of snow-white popping candy.
of course heh, you didn't see the look on joshua's face. he could barely hold back his tears.
my conversation with sunday convinced me that there's a traitor in the family, and that they hold the secrets of penacony... so, i took the opportunity to set everything in motion.
he also asked about the xianzhou alliance. maybe he saw it in the admission documents himeko submitted.
i've asked our friends from the express to take care of that for us. worry not, you'll have your moment when the current stalemate is broken.
what's wrong? are you not feeling well?
but i hope i made the right decision this time
wait, are you for real?
such a direct act of provocation is enough to get my competitive side worked up too.
was that a message from lady bronya? hm, this theft case has been dragging on for too long -- she must have decided to intervene
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall
this has nothing to do with them. besides, the more people involved, the more problems there will be.
mikhail is grandpa's name.
i spent a long time wondering what to give you... in the end, i realized i should stick to what i'm good at. miss asta loves my fried rice, so i hope you like it too.
ugh why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
n--no, why would anything have happened?
which means it's you, mister sampo. i've been using this term of address -- but it was you who first came up with it.
fyxestroll garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen foxian fighters at the foxsomn tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
but i'm also aware that not all emotions in this world are positive if there are too many negative emotions that go unchecked, then someone needs to step in and stop them.
the talent motivation department again? internal review? will it ever end?
weak heartbeat and pulse march, you better do cpr.
the xianzhou luofu? it belongs to the hexafleet of the xianzhou alliance. we've heard of it.
weird that's what the guide says
please continue to investigate the case. all i can do is sit tight in the real world. i look forward to hearing your progress.
if those two approve of bronya, then everyone following wildfire won't question her either.
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey
the dragon lady has no power and dan feng is a criminal. one can understand their desire for a new high elder.
not only do they not smile, they are also bitter, grumpy, and weep in sorrow all the time.
i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
samuel, nice name. so, what do you need, miss samuel? and what are you willing to give up in return?
this object is no ordinary trinket. it has borne witness to blood and tears.
march seventh and i could already tell. it's clear that every cloud knight soldier we've met on the skysplitter is an elite warrior.
which means we need to decide where our next destination is, soon.
huh, i just found this in my pocket how did it get there?
oh? our ancestors once thought so too, but the miracle of longevity was nothing more than a vain dream.
age doesn't really matter. all swordmasters will understand how i feel.
order's already been restored to the alchemy commission why are we here?
he's just unconscious. don't worry.
bored? your big brother sampo's always up for a chat.
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
your injury hasn't dulled your instincts, general -- the preceptors and the commission seem deeply concerned.
oh, working together? understood. rest easy, i won't make things difficult for her.
sounds like a very elaborate way of saying that you failed.
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword"
be that as it may, did you really have to poison us?
i've spoken to miss asta -- she proposed that the two of you should decide what to do with the aether spirit her only requirement is that you keep her updated.
h--holy smokes! what's up with this guy? he just came out swinging from nowhere!
i'll request a beating for you lot! you've been told not to drink during work hours!
i must correct you, luka -- idrila never promotes the twisted notion of winners being more beautiful than losers.
could you repeat what you just said, yanqing?
according to micah, they died long ago.
hahaha! that's quite the tone to take on our first meeting. i won't forget you in a hurry.
i've instructed the artisanship commission to keep the sword safe in the arsenal. if you have any doubts, feel free to ask the people involved.
i'm sorry dunn time for a little nap.
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
little gui's methods can be a little unorthodox, but that's just because she has a vivid imagination when it comes to getting things done, she's actually pretty reliable.
reuniting under such conditions affirmation: unpleasant.
it's a tiny robot? is it searching for something? but i don't remember mister svarog issuing an order like this recently
she just came back from a scientific exploration on the snow plains, but she seems really out of it almost like she's worried about something
in the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the navigator mentioned we'll have to try a little harder.
you gave your medal to that kid eric. this thing might not be as valuable, but it's at least a replacement of sorts.
yeah, anyone could see that. i just wanted to hear you say it again.
are you sure? i'm not well-read, so i might really believe you!
you got the gist from natasha, right? the miners and vagrants came to blows over the vein, then svarog's subordinates pushed everyone back.
lady bailu! lady bailu, where are you?
we're truly sorry for what happened but this is not the end of the story, right?
the general must have had that in mind when he invited us to attend the wardance
seed isle's latest flavors of dried earthworm hit the shelves today -- we should head over before the queue starts. the early bird catches the... anyway.
if you're so keen to stay fine. i'm okay with it. go speak to asta. she's the lead researcher. she's in charge.
haha~ i've heard that before -- more than a few times, actually.
it's not that i don't want to. it's just that i can't... i've come so far, and i can't sum up all of that in just a few words.
wow, impressive! thank you for saving me the self-introduction.
you already know its story, so i won't go into too much detail. my main reason for being here is merely to witness your decision.
i was looking around before you got here i already looked everywhere, but march seventh is nowhere to be found.
but what if they and we aren't really that special?
she told me to make sure you return to the overworld safely. i gave it some thought, and i think the safest way is to ask this fella for help.
congratulations. you attained your very first victory in this tug of war. it's a good start.
regardless whose idea it was this place has been designated as a restricted area. no one is allowed to enter.
straight to the point, just the way i like it -- i'm here to challenge you, boss svarog!
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
this memory zone is overly twisted. i have to use inelegant methods, so you two please give me a little time
um i know you're working hard for the people down here, but mister svarog doesn't trust human emotions. he only trusts his calculation results.
you mean, what are they made of? it's geomarrow that's undergone a change in color. the color of geomarrow is related to the environmental temperature during its refinement.
our bout just now was something else!
sound promising! i'll meet you in the underworld, then.
i haven't moved. what you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. they're all over the station. i just connect to one wherever i am needed.
but i disagree. robots have their own thoughts and feelings
i'm sure she knows it better than i do.
well, you have a point let me ask you this: if there's a fussy child who refuses to eat green peppers, what's the best way to make him eat them?
correct. and it's different from the underground towns you described. the fragmentum there has quite literally torn everything to pieces -- there's no sign of life, despite the monsters.
this isn't my first time seeing you. i was there when you had the duel with boothill.
so far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream.
wow this place is a complete mess. and those two weirdos are probably here, too.
everyone on the express is a passenger.
every day i see silvermane guards sacrifice their lives in the fragmentum, but i've never had the resolve to change mother's mind.
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
they are mere fragments stripped from the lives of the vidyadhara.
thank you for your efforts, memokeeper - quite a brilliant move to pit enemies against each other.
ha! i'm honored to be one of the things in the underworld that even you don't know about!
i never thought the world beyond belobog could be so huge
why of course, but now's not the time.
that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name
no, nothing... maybe i'm just overthinking things... however, if this traitor really exists, could they be responsible for firefly and robin's deaths?
maybe it's because she left home early she realizes that dreams, while enchanting, are ultimately just that -- dreams.
that's how i trained my swordplay and healing skills. you are also a wanderer. surely you understand.
when i first saw the ranger and the hunter together, my heart skipped a beat... i never thought you'd successfully trigger a conflict between the two.
lefton's suspicion level can be downgraded.
the dreamscape of chic, luxury and consumerism -- the moment of dusk -- my companions have been there too.
we may not be able to decide our lives, but the dreamscape is doomed to be just a dreamscape. for those who fall into the abyss, i can only hope to help them heal and return to reality in peace
what must have transpired to cause her such a drastic change? still, orders are orders. it's not for soldiers to question their superiors.
but did he ever teach you how to deal with the mara-struck?
besides, we once lived a cat-and-dog existence. embroiling you in my affairs won't weigh on my conscience.
their actions cannot be explained by reason, because their only motivation and purpose is to destroy.
oh, that weird bunch. i'm satisfied with just one stellaron, but they've scoured the universe, obtained several, and still aren't satisfied. i don't know what their true intentions are.
hmph, you do it next time -- i'm tired of being the villain.
this sword case is intended for the wardance's award. it's empty now, but in a few days, a precious sword will be delivered and stored inside.
my thesis might just be related to the express... i hope you'll agree to be interviewed later -- i need first-hand information.
yeah, maybe. but if the case was too much trouble, wouldn't it be too conspicuous to carry around the sword like that in plain sight?
and now it seems you need to confirm our identities before you can contact our companions.
we can move out any time. let me know when you're ready.
i can imagine. a parent is often a child's first hero, and their image can influence their whole life.
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
i will hold them back. don't let hoolay escape!
according to the description in the news, i'm certain i once encountered him.
what's all this nonsense? even if you were married to him, you still couldn't represent the intelligentsia guild!
as for which one we're headed to, that still requires a vote
we talked about a lot of things -- how she repaired the express, all about her adventures, a certain resident fluffy conductor, and you guys
looks delicious, huh? i should have taken a bite first.
heh, the most famous restaurant in town. natasha would bring the kids who behaved well here for a special meal.
that memory zone meme, it is here as well.
we came here for something known as a stellaron.
"be more patient." well said. remember what you learned today, because there will be many more situations in the future that will require you to "be more patient."
the universe is vast, and our lives are but specks. the trailblaze never ends, but against the backdrop of the cosmos, the average person's lifelong journey is merely a short stretch.
don't worry. master oleg and pitch-dark hook the great, i'll win this for sure.
for long-life species, such events are more like yesterday's memories than ancient history. this awful spectacle is child's play in comparison.
barely. the people here are way too gullible. a little bait is all it takes for them to bite, and they run away at the slightest hint of danger. in other words, they're naive and cowardly!
secondly, trial of the mirror. like a mirror's reflection, one needs to personally experience the pressure others feel in a job in order to understand it.
good, then i'll also count on you with the preparation of the receptacle.
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
i should have realized sooner -- a civilization that can give rise to someone like you wouldn't be easily wiped out.
the part that was corroded is irreversible, so the space station will always be in a state of quasi-fragmentum.
every day, i try to figure out how to repair some of them and return the robots to normal. except there are a lot more than mister svarog and i can handle on our own.
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of
other than the the family of the harmony, it's hard to imagine any other power in the universe that could sustain a building of such magnitude.
exactly -- the automatons would be our turrets in space. that's also how himeko uses her satellite.
contact the exalting sanctum. tell them, if they see a light in the sky, all units are to retreat immediately!
indeed, and i've learned not to judge a book by its cover anyway, that's enough reflection for one day. let's get going.
there are all kinds of wonders in the universe -- you never know what you might find with a telescope.
she specifically mentioned that if you wish to buy anything at the inn, be it food or otherwise, just let the innkeeper know. the commission will cover the cost.
we're just here for the questioning. we'll leave as soon as it's over.
are you trying to scare people away?
that outsider looks weak, but is pretty brave. if he weren't on the xianzhou and hadn't met me, he'd totally get robbed just for lugging such a huge case around.
let's focus on the business at hand. that miner we met said his brother came this way -- we should look around.
it's complicated, but in a nutshell, he's now the former oak family head.
but even if there's no one to greet you, you should wait for the host, don't you agree?
ahem, let's leave this discussion for later. for now, we should be focusing on returning miss tingyun to her normal self.
and it's suspicious how they suddenly finished their "overhaul" and walked away as soon as they laid eyes on us.
ah! i remember a good place that's not too far from here. follow me!
but on the contrary, those staff members used "stargazer navalia is on lockdown" as an excuse to persuade us to leave. this contradicts the cloud knights' plans.
anyway, don't dwell on names. as long as the machine works, what does it matter whether it's a "jade abacus" or a "computer"?
there will come a day when the sky will drizzle, and i will hear the call of gaiathra triclops and know that it is time for me to go and be reunited with my family.
you were wrong, igor. "the next punch is always what matters most." for our world, the future is what truly matters.
we will transfer ownership of the radiant feldspar to the astral express! a meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.
do such things often happen here?
the audition is over. you are now a student of dreamweaver academy. here is your student card.
is this order really correct? lemme see
they're not foxians at all. they revealed their true form. they're borisin, just like the bandits i defeated on the ipc ship.
what strong names! greetings, ninja ruri and ninja hiryu!
i think it's safe to say that the shadow of madam cocolia was the reason for this invasion. the other anomalies we experienced were probably also a direct result
the robots will have seized the road ahead by now. we should go carefully.
as for "genius," don't mention that word to me again.
let's hope justice will prevail soon. i have a question for you, if you don't mind: how did the family come to the conclusion that the murderer was within the family?
who's there? didn't your parents tell you to knock before--
and you will die. i mean... all of you will.
the smell of this luofu swordmaster is as pure as his character -- i only detect the scent of rain. hmm, does this mean that his will is pure, or that he is too naive?
it must have been a big project to require that much manpower the "charmony festival," perhaps.
i've decided. i'm gonna raise the issue with the conductor and get them to put together a training room for you!
i came with a merchant ship. the shadows of old friends have returned to my thoughts of late i came to reunite with them and relive old times
you're pretty sharp. divination commission staff call this the "loafing gate."
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow
this is an automaton direwolf, but it appears to have been modified. it's most likely another abandoned robot pet
from before the memory loss, before the express
i also have something i wish to discuss with the merchant guild, but i'll wait for you to finish.
i'll cross that bridge when i get to it. for now, there's still some time before that payment is due, so why not exercise the right to freedom that i've just regained?
i know you're penacony's festive superstar, so i expect you to show me what you're made of.
i'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the skysplitter.
before i lost my memory so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
i would ask: would you still embark on this journey?
be careful when you draw your swords, and make sure you don't hurt each other.
the forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
that's right. we're evacuating the miners together with wildfire. are there any other civilians up ahead?
it works in a similar way to our automatons. if we could launch our automatons into space like satellites, it'd definitely give us an edge in combat.
yeah! an actual assistant! c'mon, don't be so distrusting -- do i look like someone people can't rely on?
seriously, do you actually know anything about swordplay or what?
mister ratio, your style of questioning would seem to have a preconceived bias.
we don't really need that stove to cook.
it's time to deploy the automaton stealth bomb.
serval, i understand your reluctance to rejoin the silvermane guards.
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of "death" and shared this truth with all of us.
it appears to have a malfunction, but i think i can understand it
no, only a handful. after all, i prefer warm memories baked in sunshine. they're the ones that usually belong to kind people.
are you alright with this, miss tingyun?
why, of course i will! meeting friends from the astral express is always a moment worth cherishing!
mister svarog's warnings about the potential risks do make me nervous.
stroll around the luofu more don't drink sweet dreams soda ok, i've got it memorized.
even if the preceptors' interference denied you a true rebirth
if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the xianzhou zhuming!
i asked her already and she said it was fine. she seems like she really trusts you.
this isn't just a heliobus illusion, it's a complete sensory barrier -- cutting off the individual from the outside world. in this case, even the harmonic chime won't work.
let's make sure it never moves again.
if you want to find arlan, just contact march.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go
thank you, but that won't be necessary. it matters not if my flesh is pierced by the insect's horns. the closer i get to death, the closer i may get to the path of the beauty.
alright, i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
pardon my abruptness, but i have a habit of asking questions. as fellow beings of this universe, are you acquainted with idrila the beauty?
so, what do you think? i can certainly prepare more for you. it's become somewhat of a tradition to bring strawberry pastries when i visit stephen lloyd. his attendance seems quite dependent on them.
we're taking you to see the general of the luofu. you can profess your innocence all you like, but the general will decide your fate.
however, the three questions i posed earlier were not just for the nameless, but for you too, general jing yuan.
as a grassroots organization, wildfire did an extraordinary job maintaining order for over a decade in the absence of the guards. i can only imagine how much work you put in to protect the underworld.
ugh, that noise! do fragmentum monsters usually sound like this?
i hear the blue hour is very romantic. do you have any tales to share?
you win! i'll help you to the best of my ability -- free of charge i might add! but please, don't go spreading rumors about me?
no, i mean... what did you mean by "becoming one myself"?
to your tenacity throughout time, to each sorrowful night, and to the dawn that is finally upon us.
the last time i saw him was in the master control zone. he was with wen shiling from the department of implement arts.
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
we all walk our own paths. though it may be lonely, as long as we keep moving forward, we won't forget each other.
she went toe-to-toe with the general's star pupil! i'd be pretty pleased with myself, too.
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
nope, i'm not about to suffer in pain. it's much easier being a coach, hehe.
no need to expand on that now. it's not yet time to reveal my trump card.
you can always find them.
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it they don't teach this stuff in school. wait did i even go to school?
he wanted to go investigating on his own, so i let him~
"all in the name of peace" -- that's our motto.
come with us for now. i'll take care of things here later.
but for some reason, the aeon disappeared among the stars without a trace -- almost as if they had never existed leaving only their descendants.
maybe the other family heads don't think "death" is a big deal one thing's for sure -- there's a lot of internal conflict within the family, and everybody has their own agenda.
jing yuan, i'd like to borrow the seat of divine foresight's "chess board" for this purpose.
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want. we will likely meet again.
if a space telescope were deployed at this location on the express, it would almost certainly be possible to observe shorter wavelengths...
have you considered whether the answer to your question will be of any relevance to our current predicament?
hm? not really. it's my personal training plan.
i sent multiple letters, all met with silence. you know her, himeko, the space station is but a mere warehouse for followers and rare items. she doesn't really care about it.
even though they look all bright and colorful, they're still stones, right? aren't you all looking for these kinds of stones?
before i met xiaohan, i always imagined everyone at the ipc would be like skott -- overbearing and dodgy.
we should take advantage of the momentum to upgrade the aurum alley dock and increase its transaction volume.
they are. what's wrong?
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
how was she? did you deliver the medicine?
*sigh* sometimes i practice over a dozen times before reporting to my superiors, but i still can't get it right
looks like she also sent you a message
peace is the best for business. it's best to work with persuadable people. for those who are less persuadable, cooling them down with a fan works wonders.
so, the moles are a part of wildfire
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
birds belong to the sky, so we should help them return there, right?
fallout from this incident remains. surely you have plenty of pressing matters to attend to? or is the safety of the space station beneath your concern?
now, i'd like to give something to his descendant in return for his gift.
i have faith in you. however, before we depart, there is one more thing i must tell you.
no, no matter how i think about it, something is definitely off. grandpa didn't tell me anything about the ceremony. he must be hiding something.
this is your handwriting, arlan!
you should not mention this name it has been a forbidden word for a long time.
don't let her words distract you.
your confession came sooner than we expected. so, is this one of doctor primitive's schemes?
i'm sushang, and i recently joined the cloud knights. talk to me if you have any issues but i don't know the luofu very well either, hehe.
oh? seems like numby really likes that!
there's nothing there.
sounds good. but ms. navigator, i must point out that--
lefton. that guy lost his hand
you remember rivet town? when the fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. we didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
it's telling the truth mister svarog made a promise to me, and he never betrays his promises.
your master yanqing wasn't as lucky. he's probably still in bed
the most important thing in a soldier is one's intuition for victory or defeat. and you have given me confidence in victory.
i'm still alive.
relax. when the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
march, i don't think that poem is about you
i sent a message to sushang telling her to meet up at oldies depot.
being on the express isn't exactly the same as "traveling" or "adventuring" the astral express symbolizes "trailblazing" you understand?
that's my conclusion from my long-term observations. as for those lost guards maybe they were chasing these little creatures and couldn't find their way back.
but, once the formatting is complete, pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish
alright, alright. lady bailu, it's getting late -- you need to go home now.
perhaps he plans on doing so, but i won't.
agreed. it's hard to imagine members of the genius society taking an interest in such mundane research
"i bestow poison in the guise of sweet dew. come the toil of spring and yield of fall, i patiently wait for the branches to be heavy with withered fruits."
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like hair accessories or brooches?
i see. that explains why something always felt off about your appearance.
once this gathering ends, i will return to the express to continue my journey.
now, i can embark once more on my journey as a "traveler of no return," exploring the paths that lie beyond.
whether it's calming, joyful, angry, or sad, all they need is a little nudge to take that step toward where they truly belong.
the fire demon of fetora, the duke of the annihilation gang there is another secret with ifrit.
oh forgive me, i forgot to introduce myself. i'm an interstellar merchant -- my xianzhou registered name is "luocha."
yes. no need to worry, my friend. the cartridge has never left the space station.
okay, so what are we waiting for? let's get moving and see if we can find some witnesses.
hey, you two! cat got your tongue or something? if you knew what was best for you, you'd get out of my way!
if you like, i can give all of you a small private show any time.
look for another -- every platform linked to the gear bridge should have a similar terminal.
ten years of being sealed away has sapped the underworld's vitality. now that the furnace core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
please excuse us, benefactors. i look forward to our meeting.
"i have drifted far from my homeland and am on the brink of death. yet, i take solace in having honorably fulfilled my duties."
ah yes, general feixiao has a counselor by that name. i've heard that it's very, very difficult to see him, unless he reveals himself willingly. but usually he's nowhere in sight
you could say he's a special case. for most people the interview process is much shorter.
we'll turn the entire heliobi-hunting process into regular uploads. viewers will see that there's nothing that scary about it, and there won't be any public panic!
fate has brought us together -- that makes us friends! i often perform at exalting sanctum, so if you've ever got time, come and enjoy the show!
once catastrophe has been averted, we shall discuss this in greater detail.
glad to be traveling with you again, miss black swan.
it looks like this gate has a more complicated structure than the last one
sorry, i'm afraid there's not much i can do for you -- our task this time is just to "place" the target properly.
didn't they mention something else? "topaz"?
i may not be capable of the things that dan feng was capable of.
hmm, a drone that was supposed to sound an alarm suddenly went silent worth remembering. anything else?
sure looks like it and they were probably placed here not long ago
at this point, there is no need to hide things from you. i believe there's more to the incident involving the stellaron on penacony.
nice! you guys are pretty handy -- you picked that up in no time. wanna be my assistants? average pay, but i'm a good boss.
nope. i met him and you at the same time.
apologies, it's an unfortunate habit of mine. when one is immersed in academic research, skepticism comes far more naturally than belief.
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy
err is something wrong here? this is too easy. the first case wasn't hard, but this one
the essence of turn-based games lies in the numbers, so you'd better get ready to witness the precision of my calculations!
so you suggest accepting aventurine's proposal to team up?
if that's true, it's no wonder there are so many similarities between this place and the sweet dream.
this is a work habit of mine -- using touch to open my senses and letting the details of your biological existence flood into my brain helps me understand your construction as a living organism.
but the best-laid plans of snow mice and men often go awry they didn't realize the parts would interfere with the robots' systems and cause them to run amok.
i've always firmly believed that no one knows this city better or loves it more than the supreme guardian.
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
yes, i suggested to yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. a hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."
let's get going, everyone. the hour of trailblazing is upon us.
a few days ago, the spiritfarers received reports about an ipc transport ship that was attacked by borisin. then, a bunch of those abominations were dumped into this place.
easy there, don't get mushy on me now. we professional types don't have time for "thank yous." it's business! feelings don't come into it.
this is my own time. i came here to learn from master apyra to learn from these swords.
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
before we found you, she'd already revealed her stellaron hunter identity, and shared a lot of information.
after that, she asked the express to escort miss tingyun back home. we made a stop at penacony along the way, partly to allow her some time to convalesce.
haha, this is a personal visit -- no need for formalities. call me jing yuan.
my name is dan heng.
y'know, i just realized there's something i forgot -- maybe you could help me remember.
why would i do that, mister aventurine? i'm just wondering what a passerby who stumbled upon a scene of murder could have found out, that's all.
don't worry, the space station is not as fragile as you think. whether it's cosmic warfare or the incident that just took place, they're all within herta's grand plan.
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
compared to the skies and the stars, our lives are as brief as fleeting insects how i wish i can witness the day that the xianzhou truly returns in triumph.
you're right. if igor could see how impressive you are on the wardance stage, he would definitely be very proud.
i'm going to work really hard, so i can save up and explore the stars just like grown-ups do!
i appreciate the offer, but i need to head back and deliver my reports.
but didn't someone work hard to make this? i can't just take it from here
i take my job seriously! i'd never post something like "late as usual" on a public forum.
wildfire has tried many times to make contact with svarog -- without success. he has no intention of engaging with us.
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences and can come to represent what we seek the most.
i don't think so no one should be living here. i never saw anyone when i came here to hunt for supplies.
stop overthinking and just open it.
there are many "charming" creatures across the universe. please keep your guard up if you don't know the other party's intentions.
please, stay a little longer, elder huaiyan.
she had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
the master diviner has a harsh tone, but she speaks sense. to be completely honest, her lectures are quite memorable
really? you're gonna say yes just like that?
because such selfish pursuits in the name of "good intentions" once led to a tragedy on the luofu that served as a warning to future generations.
that marked-up map is a map of prisoners' escape routes. vidyadhara craftsmen once made blueprints for the prison's construction, so i imagine, mister taoran, you have a similar map in your possession. this pill --
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
it is as i said: here we stand so different from one another. dan feng is no more -- now there is only dan heng. but i
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents
but if you're going to work in the space station long-term, the stellaron may have some serious effects on the station's fragmentum. as the lead researcher, that's a risk i cannot take.
hehe, these "talks" aren't exactly what you might expect, but i have to agree, the supreme guardian definitely knows how to govern a city. that's the reason i'm here on jarilo-vi -- to meet with her.
can you make an exception and let them in? i'll provide my vip card as guarantee that they won't cause any trouble, okay?
no matter what, i hope you can trust aventurine -- or rather -- trust me and see the "truth" with your own eyes. this can lead us deeper into the secrets behind penacony.
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times it's making me a little nervous.
i've weakened blade's senses to the outside world so that he's only able to hear my voice and feel my touch -- he's oblivious to everything else.
this atmosphere is this really a marketing class?
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
there is an unwelcome third party here with us.
what could be more important than herta's safety?
i'm curious about the express' trajectory. will it pass by the place i call home?
do i miss it? if you're talking about the time with my comrades-in-arms, of course. but other than that, i don't really prefer it over life in the underworld.
i'll just assume that's a compliment! maybe next time, you could just say "silver-tongued."
i was just about to get into those, before miss march's colorful attempt.
oh, okay -- i feel a bit better then. i was worried i spoke out of turn or upset him.
very good. i'm grateful you're willing to listen to your director's suggestions. it's truly an honor.
seeing as we're in penacony the answer is "sweet dreams troupe," right?
ah, i see. sheriff, the murderer is lefton. the evidence is the tie, right?
oh, you two already know each other? guess we don't need any introductions then!
but elder, your actions have gone beyond mere survival you've become a beast driven solely by the propagation, devoid of even a hint of empathy.
there's still more work to do to revitalize aurum alley. let's give it our all.
so the truth is clear now, right?
hah. so this is the life of a "nameless"? eternally bustling about, never catching a moment's rest.
pom-pom, the conductor -- what kind of food do they like? do they like snow radish? herbs? or maybe
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
...wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. your gamble... is not over yet.
oh, right, you guys call it a "camera"! anyway, did that all make sense?
if what oleg says is true, then svarog is an architect creation leftover from the old era.
grandpa always treats me like a child. but come to think of it, at his age, who isn't a child to him?
i must apologize for your long wait, honored guests.
there isn't any concrete information yet, but anomalies have been reported around the area. the family is currently investigating.
i'm giving you one last chance. please do your best.
i only care about one thing right now -- demonstrating to the shareholders of the ipc that jarilo-vi can generate value.
i thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant memokeeper might have left in your mind. now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.
lady asta must know what this means.
yes. when customers are done eating, they can come to the alley for a stroll.
experience is always the best teacher -- so go ahead and try for yourselves with these two lamps!
i don't think you need a bystander in this scenario. go on ahead.
i wonder if i could be of help? please seek me out anytime if you require more information about the beauty.
i don't have much to go on now. perhaps we should talk to the other miss tingyuns here.
without a doubt, you aced it.
mm it's just an ordinary snowdrift. are you sure you're not seeing things?
"bathed in my light, my people shall flourish, while all evil shall be eradicated."
(hang fire, march -- i don't think luocha was here to beat people up he wanted to make a deal, right?)
lady bronya has ventured deep into the most dangerous regions of the front line with us -- many times for that matter.
aha--! i knew it, i always have an eye for talented people. no problem, take your time.
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
you should go back soon, lady bailu. those two medics have had a rough day.
it's only natural for a director to familiarize himself with a performer's resume before an audition.
you wouldn't stand a chance.
take it and enter the championship. show the universe your strength and resolve, and you will surely find the answer you seek.
i knew it. this will be a breeze for you.
as the marshal's special envoy, i'll dispatch the luofu cloud knights to pursue hoolay myself.
in all the time since i took him in, this has never happened.
it's a grassroots organization. think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
of course, i know everyone here. on penacony, anyone could be lying but the remembrance does not lie.
calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to what again?
i almost lost my cool when he went for his flask
then on to the next order of business -- let's discuss your companion, shall we?
what's this...? medical advice?
really, i wouldn't do anything to her.
luckily, he'd already hidden in his little sleeping pod when the disaster struck.
march's weakness is that she likes to get involved in other people's business. perhaps that's also her strength.
hey, let me ask you something
i'm happy that he was able to find a new life.
it's the armillary sphere for sure. there's a shape on it that really looks like pom-pom!
now, esteemed knight and delegation members, please head to the artisanship commission, where --
ah, yes, i remember you. your performance at herta's space station was adequate, i suppose.
i'm unsure if jingliu has ever mentioned this to you, but we had a mutual friend who was a nameless, just like you.
my strategy uh, sorry. it's my first time participating in the wardance. i'm the only one in my team, so i don't have any strategy to speak of.
ha! i knew you'd say that. here, i've got a gift for you
am i correct in saying that this is your first time entering a victory zone?
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
i'm about to embark on an unknown journey, where it will be impossible to maintain my orderly life. i will have to navigate unexpected surprises, much like today.
the end of our battle signifies my departure... the moment has finally arrived for me to bid farewell to the express.
according to the plan, the ceremony will begin in six hours. the skysplitter will be activated, and all visitors will board the ship to watch the contest.
so, yunli, what do you think we should do?
pretty sharp, aren't you, chicken wing boy?
not really, no. she was a military history major -- very different from what i was doing.
though i too find this way of making my entrance rather excessively deliberate, we're not blessed with the luxury of time
i must apologize... i cannot believe that such a beautiful creature was merely a hallucination. its deceptive and threatening nature is much uglier than its appearance would suggest.
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i am invited to host the public bidding of the aurum alley commercial district. with members of all parties present, the proceedings may begin.
the answer is: there is no difference. the sword pierces the body and severs its life.
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces let's hurry back.
was there anything particularly memorable?
to show our reverence, we named this fortress after the aeon themself. the architects, under the protection of qlipoth, have continued to lead this city forward, repelling all manner of disasters.
a lot which is why wildfire has never been able to take him down. svarog's forces are too strong. we don't have enough firepower.
the formula and technique seem oddly familiar.
always on the hunt for more followers
clara said she was going to find components, right? let's start with nat's storage room.
hey march! don't forget to take a picture of the stellaron for me.
well then, it would seem that everything is in place. let's go and meet our old friend.
i've only chanced upon it a few times myself, but whenever i tried to take a photo of it, it had already run away.
thanks for the concern, but i'll manage. it's my first time on this world -- i'd like to take in its vast, iconic snowscape for just a little longer.
this shell hmm it doesn't appear to be the same design as this little fella's
i spoke to mister yang. i'll be staying on the express this time. i wish you all a delightful time in penacony.
yes, a genius got involved. she's very accomplished in the field of life sciences and managed to grant miss tingyun a shot at survival.
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
as a fellow arbiter-general, i fully understand the difficulties of this position.
and you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
so i want to draw up a training schedule for you and march!
more importantly it was only after losing my arm that i found the meaning of life -- what it really feels like to be alive!
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
looks like things blew up real quick everyone's flocked here to see what's going on.
(unexplained coma? that's actually what happens to your body if your brain dies in a dream, but unfortunately, the customer ended up waking up in the end.)
i'm from belobog. we've only recently re-established connections with the cosmos, so you might not have heard of it.
what you said was the last piece of the puzzle for me. i suddenly realized that my decision to leave was just me trying to run away from my problems wasn't a mature decision.
come, young man -- i'll let you finish up.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
mister sampo, take a closer look this is a wonderful smoked red herring.
really? you're not kidding, are you?
i don't have a stirring pre-battle speech, yanqing.
outsiders, follow me. belobog lies beyond this blizzard.
the evidence is above us.
but wildfire will be familiar with all manner of forces below ground. if we want to find stellaron clues in the underground, i'm certain they can help.
in your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
and guess who arbitrated that case and handed down the sentence? none other than general jing yuan himself.
haha, who would've thought? that you'd be so immensely popular in some weird circle.
that's right. you must defeat my four companions gathered here -- then you will have proved yourself a worthy opponent.
this atmosphere really feels strange are you sure topaz is here?
but i suggest you don't bother him. he's given himself a personal trial.
i think the thief knew that little fay had an alarm, so they decided to break it.
that's not true, general huaiyan. she's been here a while, but i'm sure you've heard of her unbridled nature.
i really hope the museum can open up soon the children here need a culturally-enriching environment -- especially those from the underworld
for some reason, i'm suddenly stricken by the feeling that we haven't crossed paths in quite some time.
i never thought slacking off could convince me of anything the sign of a true scholar! a diviner of the divination commission after all!
quite the contrary -- i made a terrible mess of things. fortunately, the tourists thought of it as nothing more than a spell of merrymaking.
i'm glad you believe in me, truly. but the problem remains: will the realm-keeping commission trust a judgment based on this logic?
after we revealed our intentions, the supreme guardian suspended communications and sent soldiers to arrest us. her reaction was strange, to say the least.
be careful, benefactors. the disciples of sanctus medicus worship yaoshi the plagues author -- the greatest enemy of the xianzhou.
both at the controls and behind the turret -- caiyi was like a cold blade efficient, decisive, unfeeling when she had to be.
forget it, it's not important. old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
even after all this time, being by her side makes me feel like a young fox again perhaps it's because she's become more affectionate with age?
so, are you planning to continue melting down the rest of hanguang's swords?
need a rest? go! tell you a secret though -- a champion wins by training hard while others rest.
wildfire can provide that while svarog is recovering.
thanks to you and sushang, aurum alley's success is nearly a done deal!
the duty of the silvermane guards is to serve the people. so, where can we find these robots? clara, can you lead the way?
i wonder if you know why hoolay wasn't taken into custody by the foxian-majority xianzhou yaoqing, but instead imprisoned in the xianzhou luofu, miss lingsha.
like i said, we'll go and see. once we've packed everything, we should head to our next destination.
as you can imagine, the conclusions that the evidence points to are not mutually exclusive. which means this is probably another prank from miss sparkle.
it's a very cute room, miss march just like you.
all existing fragmentums are connected, so there will be monsters that will enter the space station through its fragmentum.
you go back first. i'm going to take a stroll along the streets.
himeko and mister yang told me that qlipoth is far from the only aeon in the universe. for example, the enemies that invaded belobog seven hundred years ago were emanators of another aeon.
if you wish to dispel miss qingni's curiosity, perhaps we can take a small step back from the topic at hand. what do you wish to know about yukong the pilot?
but arlan doesn't care about getting hurt, he only cares about protecting others. it's the only way he feels... fulfilled.
let's look around and see if we can find some clues.
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
it's eric, right? here, you can have this.
ahhhh well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
has pascal been waiting for rivet town's evacuated residents to return?
ah! can you not do that? don't worry, this time we're gonna avenge you! i'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
merlin's claw, is this your line of thinking or the ten lords'?
mister xiao, why not try working with us? mingxi is pushing for reforms within the guild. we're nothing like the president.
let's go -- can't keep a girl waiting, can we?
i have worked in every post in the sky-faring commission from maintenance to pilot, combat reserves to stargazer such a long time has gone by so quickly.
compared to the aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of aeons and the paths.
that smells so, so good! where is it coming from? is it coming from the kitchen on the express?
did you at any moment think about what i would feel if something happened to you?
there's no need to say that the beauty of music is its ability to resonate with people and stir up their imaginations.
but, i can tell you one thing: my favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
the past and present of the sky-faring commission do not have such a simple relationship. the events of the past crafted its current greatness.
fool, you've been left with no choice since the moment you accepted the invitation to be here. you better pick a side while you have the chance, or else you'll end up losing everything.
so, did the elders send you to take out the "unworthy" high elder?
i am the director of this film as much as i am an actor in it. when it comes to the last scene that i will appear in
my rational mind tells me yes, yet my heart tells me to believe.
still, when i was clearing out the rear courtyard recently, i found these beautiful stones buried in the pen where snowmoon used to live i guess snowmoon must've buried them there.
no, i recognize my family's handwriting. we are all doctors after all.
you're not really here to help me. you're here to stop me, right?
are you a knight of beauty?
of course you will! you just have to eat well, sleep well, train well, and you'll be even stronger than i am! when that happens, you'll be able to ko me in just a few punches, and then yell triumphantly in the ring!
i had a strange encounter. i was at the plaza, watching people play cards and i met a kind-hearted girl. she said she could help us repair the jade abacus we brought.
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
(where are you going? we're trying to trace luocha's movements -- we shouldn't backtrack.)
hmm can i see this pom-pom? sounds like a talking teddy bear to me.
i felt tired of voyaging -- like i'd lost the courage to pull on a bowstring ever again. i hid away in the sky-faring commission and buried myself in work, never wanting to see the sky again.
i accept your challenge, hoolay. because the very moment you stepped aboard the skysplitter, you stepped onto your path to ruin.
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
i am jing yuan, the general of the luofu cloud knights. there's no need for formality. "general" is a temporary title, and you can simply call me jing yuan.
there's no better place for looking out into the stars than the express. i envy you guys.
trailblazing implies the unknown, be it unknown risks or unknown rewards.
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
oh, come on you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
correct. that medicine is a wolf in sheep's clothing -- wildfire has cut off the supply chain.
i always get people asking me how my workshop makes money when it's not trading. use your brain! it doesn't!
no, i've thought about it. she deserves a day off.
hah? hold up, he's back? that can't be, he was still in the city a little while ago
let me see, what next
norbert's position is indeed an idle one -- it's no wonder he has time to socialize with members of the limestein family.
is there anything left to dispute? i'll cut to the chase -- the merchant guild should have removed itself from aurum alley a long time ago.
he strikes like lightning does mister dan heng really need anyone's guidance?
no matter what solutions we propose, we will always take the welfare of the people of belobog into consideration. otherwise, we'd be no different from the legion, would we?
you haven't been back home for a long time, have you master dan heng?
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
well, you can still sign up. the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
the way is awash with flames! it must have just teleported!
luka do you often find stuff for other people?
so the burden of mentoring you fell on me. it was a stressful job, and i dumped you on the train as soon as i got the chance.
my scoring criteria are different from yours.
it's true -- the divination commission really can't go a single day without lady fu.
at least half the members of the society have etched their names on the universe's wall of history -- there's aiden, emperor rubert, elias salas, doctor primitive, screwllum
it doesn't? looks like miss sparkle is more careful than i thought.
remember, this is no field trip, we're having tea with the helm master of the sky-faring commission. we'll need to act with diplomatic decorum.
i must say, i didn't anticipate this at all.
the mirage echoes of scalegorge waterscape mentioned that not only was dan feng a brave warrior -- he could heal others with cloudhymn magic.
that's what i'm saying! at first, sushang didn't believe that fyxestroll garden was haunted. but after the judges showed up
holding you in the shackling prison would be more trouble than it's worth. for security purposes, we will be performing your trial here.
who? oh you mean the state of composure?
i'd hesitate to call it that. shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom -- many people lost their lives trying to catch a tiny morsel of meat for dinner.
general jing yuan said the ambrosial arbor was an unfathomable celestial blessing
don't worry, i've got enough money with me.
and for those who don't speak fu xuan?
sometimes i find multiple good sheaths for a new sword, and i end up buying them all. and yet, one sword can only use one sheath
yes, my companions already checked in. my name is dan heng, and i believe my personal information is recorded in your system.
the back of the mine has been secured, which gives us a forward base to send in supplies. the silvermane-wildfire combined regiment is conducting rescue missions as they advance.
thank you again for your help, friends from the express. the situation remains unpredictable, so take care.
everyone, we meet again.
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
i first heard about the astral express from her. it is a shame that, in her travels to thousands of stars, she never had the opportunity to board the express -- the sacred place of the nameless.
yes. this is a visual record. no doubt about it.
so, if you're headed next door
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
things are manageable, the latest wave of monster attacks has slowed. i'm back in the city to take care of a few matters, but i'll be back on the front line later i thought i told you?
one rule though -- please don't ask anything boring
i can tell you what the future holds: if you don't go to the luofu, the stellaron will eventually contaminate the entire ship, and over half of the inhabitants will perish.
they were different from most but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
but your question would suggest that there are others interested in dissuading you from such a venture.
wait, aren't we supposed to be operating in secret?
there are only a handful of individuals who know my identity now. i do not wish to guess what could occur if word gets out.
so who exactly is the murderer?
"why can borisin control the power of moon rage?" "can we foxians break free from this curse?" these questions were asked frequently.
you you just won't stop haunting me.
space travel is pretty tempting, but what i wanna do most is help the people around me and protect my home.
what if the responder is polka kakamond?
barry needs me too? put him on another line -- i have something urgent to take care of. i'll contact him later.
so that's a yes, right? i knew it!
qingni! have you thanked your benefactors yet?
nah, it's more he's just honoring a bet. whether it's apologizing or squealing like a pig, i doubt he'd do it willingly.
we had a difficult start, but things got easier. look, that's the barge i was talking about.
hehe, it's kinda embarassing but i was caught up in the moment -- i guess i never thought it through
you're more than welcome, general huaiyan.
tell everyone about mother's true motives about a lie perpetrated for seven hundred years
there is no master plan, only a bet a bet on the senior vidyadhara's incomplete exuviation charm, and on dan heng's ability to access the memories of the high elder
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
yet you were also the most fortunate. her desire to claim everything about you for herself meant she needed time, so you were spared instant annihilation.
yo, what's up! you're finally here! without you, our ghost-hunting squad would be nothing!
maybe i should go pack my bag right now
and the gray vest, tie, hound emblem, bottle, the bartending and your role as a security officer these are all true traits
(even if luocha was able to unlock the door, what was his goal?)
the alfalfa family had a meeting with the ipc?
i think i just saw a group of void song whales fly past the window.
let me guess: a catastrophe is coming to jarilo-vi, am i right?
i need to use the spirit whisper on blade again, but let's play another round first. have you thought of your question? come to me when you're ready. i can wait.
revenge is also a form of the hunt. however, that doesn't explain how she managed to bring the stellaron into the scalegorge waterscape, which was guarded by the vidyadhara.
if you need any information, your best bet is to talk to the guide. unfortunately, i've got a few other matters to attend to right now, but i wish you both the best of luck!
no! this sword was forged by hanguang
do you really think that is the case? you don't understand merciful medicus, nor the devilish archer author, but you understand me -- do you see me as such? a heretic?
so you mean, if we can attract a large number of outsiders to this system, their free will would intertwine with this dream and shake it to its core
up to now, apart from bronya, whom sampo brought here, i still haven't seen a single silvermane guard.
my colleagues from the merchant guild accounting department want me to remind you that we haven't met our revenue target for this phase yet.
and not only do you have belobog music, but music from other planets, too
i see. i am truly impressed by the attention to detail and taste of the conductor
the camera can convey everything in place of words. her silence is a question and your reaction is an answer. you gave a logical answer.
with this, the debt between the traveling merchant and me is clear.
not a clue, i never had the urge to go on a svarog suicide mission before. you guys are the ones that want in, why not go and ask the robots?
please do not misunderstand me, general huaiyan. i was simply stating the truth. master thought it would be inappropriate to keep you waiting, so she sent us here
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
funny that sunday puts a miniature that makes him seem like a giant by comparison right where he can see it first thing in the morning. insecure much?
it's just i thought that silvermane guards were all cold and unfeeling -- they left the underworld to perish. but she doesn't give me that impression.
the touch of a paper book is a sensation i frequently find myself missing.
it's just training, for real! it's not like you to be so suspicious, seele.
so what's the story? are you full of fanciful fiction, or is asta the one hoarding secrets like they're going out of style?
maybe we can ask some people who might know the truth.
i hope you're all set i've been relishing this duel for quite some time -- don't disappoint me, now.
most of you were not aware of their arrival but it is thanks to them that our world now flourishes with hope.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. i've been warned that the ones in the mine won't go down without a fight.
monsters of that type rarely venture outside the fragmentum meaning the corrosion affecting your planet is already very serious.
but with a keen eye, it's possible to find a diamond in the rough, so to speak.
just look at this flying sword. even if i give it back to you now, it'll just be taken away again in a few hours.
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
so, the one who attacked you was a girl dressed in red, adept at illusory arts, and was able to shapeshift
the storage zone you passed through contains all our inventory, and is the main research center.
she's a member of the genius society. only those approved by nous may join -- the smartest of the smart her genius is one in a trillion.
also, it's not all bad. i might even beat you at arm wrestling now.
i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct
the small fragment of consciousness in there is gone. duke inferno has discarded this fire
oh, i remember now luka was defending his title once, and seele was watching in the audience.
mister luka, you're invited to compose...
if i were you, i would shut my mouth. it's wise to remain silent when you should.
for an object so precious, it probably comes at an even higher price than other forms of recompense.
i wasn't sure. it was just a hunch, but since misha feels familiar with this place my hunch might be correct.
it can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
huh? hold up, i wasn't that late
i can't believe i've left everyone with such a peculiar impression of me
no need, miss qingni. it was nothing.
no matter what hoolay does, there is one truth that cannot be changed: he is trapped aboard the xianzhou luofu. the only way for him to escape is to find a ship.
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
i knew you'd pick the right flowers. mom and dad will be so happy.
that's right, but i'll let miss asta explain the specifics.
attempting to storm qlipoth fort by ourselves? forget it, seele. i don't care how skilled you are. i'm not sending you on a suicide mission.
correct. all the cabins they might pass by have been checked. remember to report to lead researcher asta.
i've said before, you can liaise with your companions, or even twist the narrative against me. i'll wholeheartedly embrace it! it signifies your potential.
pascal, why do your peers keep rejecting you
hearing, touch, thought -- through these, you gain emotions -- cherish them. with emotions, we make choices. and so we return to the original question...
so, what did she seem like to you?
fools think themselves wise, but the wise know their own ignorance -- now, he has become the latter.
the person who always disappoints his sister
we'll search for the prisoners while maintaining order on the luofu, acting as if nothing has happened.
i can't wait to hear for myself how this song of harmony is going to turn out.
a... note? looks like instructions from the butler for the other servants.
if i were one of the stellaron hunters, i'd be very happy to capitalize on all the chaos. it'd be harder to escape, but easier to blend in.
"should you feel compassion for me, kind traveler, please take a handful of soil hence and bring it back to the luofu."
to prevent its resurgence, i made some minor modifications to your body -- or more specifically, your tail.
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
i appreciate your words, and i see you put a lot of effort into welcoming me, mister sunday. however, this is no way to greet a guest.
change of plan. i've decided to stay in belobog.
where are you guys headed next? if a colleague of mine happens to be there, i can give them a heads-up and have them show you guys around.
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while
these are all charred remains?
the negotiation will commence at the hotel lobby. everyone, please follow me.
why don't you skip all this rigmarole and just have a heart-to-heart conversation with me? it might tickle a little.
our journey begins anew. life passes like a fleeting rain, eventually merging with the ground. may our next encounter be... under a clear sky.
i don't know if this will work, but it's worth a try: where is clara right now?
such brute strength is not something an ordinary borisin possesses this is likely the work of hoolay.
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details
her name is sushang. she apparently just transferred here from the yaoqing.
both your approaches have merit. we would always rather avoid losses and settle matters through peaceful means. but if the situation changes, we must be prepared for armed conflict at a moment's notice.
this is a gift from the silvermane guards, to show our gratitude towards those who saved belobog.
it's a family heirloom -- it belonged to rhonda once you should take care of it.
i'm the garden of recollection's memokeeper.
they set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
if we start by investigating the starskiff he stole, maybe we can get a lead
it's you. don't sneak up behind me next time. lucky for you i wasn't armed.
but when you set foot on the planet itself, you realize how small and helpless you really are -- just like them.
something that mom isn't supposed to know?
and what did you do? you messed it up and ended up as their prisoner. i told you to make friends with a mute, not become one yourself. you really let me down.
like the time guinaifen dragged me to fyxestroll garden so i could protect her, but i was so scared i ended up fainting
otherwise, i wouldn't be able to hear your lofty opinions.
not exactly my expertise. i'm just a traveling merchant
who knows, maybe we'll cross paths again during the celebrations. oh, here's my contact information. i don't usually respond during work hours, but i'd be happy to chat off the clock~
calm down, serval! it's just a fragmentum illusion!
it's nothing urgent. we were hoping to understand helm master yukong a little better.
my take on this might surprise you.
bronya, do you really
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
the destruction? i don't understand
on the xianzhou zhuming, the judges cast those unforgivable and nearly immortal abominations of abundance into the eternal flames of the stars, reducing them to ashes.
however, i have no clue what the yaoqing arbiter-general has in mind.
i've said my piece now. even though it'll be tough for grandpa i still have to melt down the sword.
you know what? he's got me excited too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
but there is some information i can give you. that place is also used to welcome non-humanoid visitors and has a shuttle that connects to outer space.
speaking of which, why hasn't she arrived yet? they say the merlin's claw strikes like lightning. being late isn't her style.
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason
a show of unprecedented splendor is about to be staged in penacony. if you're too late to take the stage, you can work behind the scenes.
who is this weirdo?
our current plan hasn't been rated too highly maybe we can improve it a bit?
this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
nevertheless, this is but a trivial blip in the annals of galactic history. what truly matters is the course this river shall take in the days to come
seventy-five rounds see? it's fortunate we didn't join the ipc system, now we don't have to endure this misery.
you want your sword back, right? well, you can't just take it back. on the zhuming, when you lose your sword on the battlefield, you have to reclaim it on the battlefield.
excuse me little bro uh i'm not sure how old you are. can i call you "little bro"?
what an honor! where are my manners -- we can talk about heaters all day if you like. let's have a chat~
but if we didn't take care of those monsters, what were you planning to do? just stay here, shaking in your boots?
please allow me to introduce her to you, mister alfalfa. this is miss himeko from the astral express, one of the future shareholders of penacony!
i promise to be more transparent next time.
heh, don't mention it. thank you for taking the time to welcome me.
see you around, nameless~ try to stay out of trouble, especially the next time we meet!
active starskiff, active starskiff there!
i told you, gepard, the barrier hasn't been fixed yet! don't try and be a hero!
you misunderstand, young sir -- we genuinely want to help. can you tell us what happened here?
so we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
i--i've never seen a robot with this kind of malfunction before what happened to it?
i can't say for sure, but they're definitely planning something for the charmony festival.
workshop? oh, do you mean the tempering workshop in rivet town?
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
i caught a glimpse of the mechs in those crates, and they bear a striking resemblance to borisin. i wonder what they're planning this time?
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
well, it appears that you are still unable to give explanations for several details about how the nameless got involved in the ambrosial arbor crisis.
huh him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
let me see slender fingers, but strong. this hand belongs to a killer.
*sigh* spare me. beautiful eyes though -- are you from sigonia?
i've conducted a preliminary survey and found that there's one area with a relatively normal temperature on the surface of the planet. by "normal," i mean a temperature that just about allows for human survival.
we'll head off now -- the commission must be busy. i look forward to our next meeting, madam yukong.
take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. i'll have the alchemy commission healers see to you when they arrive.
it's such a bother to talk to people and try to figure out what they mean *sigh* at least when i talk to pela, i don't have to think so much
i'm sure you guys and the express itself are more than capable of maintaining security... but it's important not to overlook basic prevention methods.
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
thank you i know i'm standing safely here on the express, but sometimes gazing out at such a vast sea of stars makes me feel a little uneasy
you said i'd uncover a clue if i became the fight club champion.
but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
alright, alright, i think we're all used to march's modus operandi by now.
but sampo after all this time, what made you suddenly want to take back your mask? this doesn't seem like the sampo i know
sorry, i would have helped her myself, but i've been drowning in paperwork in preparation for the bidding.
haha, you're awful polite for a big robot. ask! don't be shy!
(hmm i suppose that makes some kind of sense.)
precisely. i've been without sight since the day i was born.
to sentimental organic lifeforms, it could be the first falling leaf in the change of seasons, or the marks carved onto someone through the passage of time.
in any case, say what you will, but i can't sit by and do nothing. not when i'm the cause of all this trouble in aideen park. there's no need to involve the dreamweavers. i'll fix these distortions once and for all.
her name is sparkle, a masked fool who has infiltrated penacony don't worry. she won't be bothering you for now. she's probably patting herself on the back for a job well done.
goodbye for now, dan heng. i hope the next time we meet, it will be under happier circumstances.
in some ways, i believe he is similar to mister svarog. i can't overlook this unique quality
i did say that if a danger proved too great for you, i would personally step in to confront it.
because in the next few centuries, visually impaired people like us will continue to require help from everyone we meet.
so that's what happened, mister svarog. but there's one thing i don't understand why is pascal being treated as a fragmentum creature?
you don't need to worry about little gui. she won't be able to sit still, even in a sick ward. i'm sure she'll come find you again in no time.
we know a little bit about it. what do you need?
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream and tell mikhail our decision.
nothing? hmm, interesting so it's all based on interpersonal credit? huh, i'm amazed everything runs on something so fragile!
i set this as the final goal of my training a few days ago. think about it -- is there any underworld opponent worth challenging more than boss svarog?
all matter and space that comes into contact with the fragmentum will be turned into fragmentum creations.
i rarely discuss my worries with robin. as the older brother, i should bear more responsibilities. the dark side of adulthood should not be brought back into our home.
my advice would be to get on. you're not doing me that big of a favor by staying anyway.
of course i did. and it wasn't some last-minute speech i cobbled together. it's how i've always felt.
and maybe we are don't get too close, or you might turn into a ghost too.
uh what's going on?
while i spent my time waiting for grandpa to return from his voyage, walder gave me this workshop, and it became my "secret base"
during that time, all children of the appropriate age in both the overworld and the underworld will be tested. in the end, only one child deemed as "worthy" will be chosen.
for the silvermane guards, the guardian's orders are paramount and absolute. but there is something of equal importance in the oath we take
i like chatting with silver wolf. she's got a lot of ideas for someone so small.
penacony and the entire universe have witnessed far too much innocent bloodshed. the strong wield their blades against the weak, and the victors push the vanquished to the brink of life
this lot won't be able to slow down the astral express crew.
i've briefly traveled with your companions and know their whereabouts, dan heng. please rest assured, your nameless companions are safe, but they need our help.
apologies, i realize this is personal speculation.
as long as bailu is in the pictures, we should be fine.
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
source code. or to be more precise -- source code that is able to take control of all mechanized units in belobog.
if you prefer, you can call me by a more familiar name, the watchmaker.
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
in that case, the vote stands at two to one.
i'll stay at the divination commission for now. there are some other matters i have to handle besides restoring the jade abacus.
then i've something private to take care of regarding that galaxy ranger. let's leave things there, shall we?
i lean towards trusting pom-pom's instinct when it has to do with the express.
that oleg he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
you've looked out for me during our travels together these past few days. i'm truly grateful and can't thank you enough.
perhaps, there's something else we can do?
if ifrit is a scion of the phase flame, then the entire incident is now clear as day.
life is ephemeral, and i only wish to be a piercing arrowhead -- to be the hunt -- until my very last breath.
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
just as expected, you and the little trotter made it to the final!
to be honest, i feel the same way.
natasha trusts me. in her eyes, an ex-military officer was more suited to be the leader of the organization than a doctor.
...but that won't come to pass. i'll do as you ask. i'll leave.
i understand in that case, please go ahead with your plans first, mister boothill and miss march seventh.
you can always find something surprising in the snow plains that's the charm of outdoor exploration.
the cloud knights are here -- i need you to help me get rid of them.
with all due respect, it's in the ipc's interest to wreak havoc before the charmony festival and the family has every reason to suspect the ipc's involvement.
claiming to have family ties with the enemy sounds to me like an attempt at asking for mercy hoolay, are you begging me for mercy?
it looks so much like dan heng i wonder if
she came for the stellaron but showed a strong interest in the curios and just as we found out about the existence of the aether cartridge, she just so happened to show up in the simulated universe.
i remember when old mettle and i first met, we weren't very accepting of each other he said i had a bad temper, and i thought he was ugly.
do you mean you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
please, don't be like that. we have so much history together, can't you have a little faith?
this isn't like our childhood games, serval. you won't get any leniency from me.
th--that's very reasonable, your honor! thank you. i promise we'll leave after asking our questions.
as you can see, after nearly one hundred days of renovation, the interior looks brand new.
i say "gift," but it's more like bits and pieces the kids cobbled together. still, i hope you like it.
i did want to ask him a few more questions, but
is captain gepard around? h--he's an old buddy of mine
i adore the vast amount of knowledge, but i cannot accept that the simulated universe remains simply a pending contract waiting to be attended to.
qingque has the guts to grab march away right in front of me and go play celestial jade but i can see she has experience. march might be able to learn a thing or two from her and apply it to her swordsmanship.
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
"tragic fate"... that duke turned his dying body to flames and sacrificed his life as a martyr. he was a determined and heroic pathstrider. not even a villain should be disparaged like this.
afterwards, wildfire began to grow. to be honest, i never thought a day like this would come.
on the contrary, that's exactly why we're here. to ask you about the case and gather more information -- we don't want any loose ends.
the longest-serving general of the xianzhou luofu. do you think he'd have only a few enemies?
somehow, a nightmare called "death" has descended upon penacony, striking indiscriminately, bringing spiritual death to all equally
i've thought about it, and well, if i were bronya, i wouldn't sign it.
this purple ninja secret brew seems like it would replenish my ninja power. shatter it and replenish some ninja power.
maybe it is! but i think we need to set our sights on something a bit more realistic. you guys want to know the whereabouts of the stellaron. wildfire wants to remove the restrictions on the underworld
don't worry about that memokeeper. let's talk about my thing. i've helped you out with everything you've asked, as agreed
when you are free sometime, i'll take you to one of my favorite scary places to test your mettle -- what do you say?
but that doesn't stop me from knowing the answer! it's glutamic acid, isn't it?
hey, don't worry. i'll help you.
i tend to forget things -- which is why, rather than memories, i'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what i normally wouldn't otherwise. so...
here, hurry up and come inside. we need to discuss the details of our next operation.
very good! staying calm and sanguine is essential when you're on stage. it is a talent most performers yearn for.
in my dream, that was the day i died.
don't blame me, this was your general's idea. when he learned that you gave up being the ringmaster to join my wolf hunt team, he insisted that i hide the plan from you. perhaps he thought your impatience would mess things up.
not at all, just doing what you asked. how about we call it even as payment for the healer lady's consultation?
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
thanks to your help, the lease was paid off and the dock capacity is increasing. i told the workers to clear out areas that weren't utilized and use them to store extra cargo.
i understand. thank you, miss huanxi.
i'll become your apprentice?
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang
miss qingni, i don't think the two of us should be reading your mother's diary.
turn around and leave? accept defeat? how is that any different than taking a desperate stand? no matter what i chose, my life wasn't in my own hands.
if i wasn't mistaken, you'd just made a serious accusation against the family.
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting
should you take a liking to them, i'll make sure to prepare more next time.
mm, i see it too. but it doesn't seem aggressive and it's all chubby and cute
those three nameless must have meant a lot to pom-pom.
i don't think i've ever seen you that excited.
if i had to choose a site for initial investigation on this trailblazing expedition, that would be it.
the purchase price of sky-amber doubled to support the lord of preservation. however, it is up to the corporation's fancy whether this becomes good or bad fortune for worlds rich in ores
timmy, open the gate please. i want to see mister svarog.
anything special about that name?
but under lady bronya's leadership, the silvermane guards will atone for past mistakes and bring relief to the people. from now on, you don't need to worry about the safety of your family.
"foreign object"? that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
how do you that's right. out there in the blizzard, there are still many threats including the monsters you saw.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
it's nothing forget i said anything.
miss sushang, what exactly has transpired here? in all my trade visits, i've never seen starskiff haven in such a state.
i've been deeply fascinated by the starry skies ever since i first heard the story of the nameless.
miss march, you said you were on your way to the belobog festivities, right? my apologies for delaying you both!
actually no. this is a hibernating snow radish rabbit.
run away, you said? well, i'm not the one who's trying to run away right now.
in hindsight, that was probably the first time that i enforced order.
thousands of years have passed since the reignbow arbiter felled the ambrosial arbor.
well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
what? didn't general huaiyan offer you any guidance?
still, we hung out every day, it's only natural that my love for inventing would rub off on her.
we're almost there everyone, stay close.
lieutenant yanqing, the winner and loser of this battle have yet to be determined. don't give me that "there's no point in fighting any longer" speech!
you're right, but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
i once witnessed your dauntless courage and tenacious will. the gates of the knights of beauty are always open to you.
life cannot be reset, but the dreamscape allows them to experience another life. so even if they have to pay a price, they would still make this choice.
if i'd known there were so many high-tech wonders on the express, i probably would've insisted on going with you guys.
this may sound embarrassing, because i would sometimes forget stuff i really shouldn't have from past experiences... it's just a habit of mine, don't mind me.
but who's to say there won't be any changes? maybe deep down, i'm also anticipating this possibility.
there's no point in resisting, mister norbert. your accomplices have been subdued. there's nowhere to run.
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter
that dose of "bitter poison" i'm curious as to how you found this information.
clara had already arrived at the storage room by the time we got there. we split the painkillers with her.
considering the intense battle with hoolay and then with general feixiao ahem, the rigorous sparring session with her! his small body couldn't take it anymore.
huh who's wilder? and what's "aetherium wars"?
not yet, everything looks normal so far. i think the problem is stemming from the energy hub.
gepard! way to make it obvious.
actually, seeing as there's no one around can i ask you some things?
what's going on? why is it getting hot in the memoria?
also, the dock is a military installation -- the cloud knights would be on the scene at the slightest disturbance. how did so many monsters show up without warning?
what do you take the ipc for, miss march? we're just the same as belobog's architects -- we're all followers of the preservation.
never mind about that. here -- this is for you. i made it this morning. and i've been keeping it warm.
i um i don't take sides!
miss march, you might have the wrong idea. i'm just feeling a mix of regret and relief.
my friends and i used to wander those streets thinking about where to find our next meal. that is, until chief oleg got me out and took me to the orphanage.
it's simple. that stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
after their coming of age ceremonies, a lot of them aspired to join the ipc to make it big.
but the plan has changed. as her brother, i know she doesn't want to sing for the order, so i'll take her place.
well, even though i'm a vidyadharan like you, i'm an outsider just like my companions here. i can't really say much about a "remedy," but i do have a piece of advice, miss lingsha.
after all, this is the only place i'm able to lose the helm master uniform and relax a little.
you're right. i've probably been idle for too long -- it's easy to get stuck in your own head.
splendid, well done. this was a spectacular move.
mister gallagher, you even know my name?
we'll stay a bit longer, but not too long.
did you really think the galaxy rangers were outsiders this whole time?
i have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. this was also part of grandpa's orders.
hehe, giving a dramatic speech to my boss was cool and everything, but it's not gonna help her break free from the heliobus clouding her mind.
share your findings with me, and me alone. i don't want vague conjecture to interfere with other people's judgments before we find solid proof.
who's he? i'd like to see more information on him.
let's go, we must try to squeeze some answers out of cirrus.
it's a family heirloom, and probably has a history? my ma can swing it with just one hand, but i struggle even with two. ah
that's why i'm here -- to help the general eliminate those demons.
the sofas here on the express are too comfy. after falling asleep even my dreams are soft and cuddly.
i can't stand discourtesy -- even when it comes from myself.
do you remember the invite that the express received?
as if nothing has happened? yanqing said he'd assist the generals, and now he's nowhere to be found. with the host's ringmaster gone, how are we supposed to act like nothing has happened?
there are many such people on penacony. failure is like the setting sun to a dreamchaser. it's something that happens every day.
relax, i'm pretty self-disciplined. i usually don't even take drinks with sugar in them.
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide this kind of work was made for him.
no need for that. we'll return to the express now.
huh? they were on their feet a second ago
oh, really? but i just heard pom-pom say that she sometimes sleeps in until noon.
yes this is where we put an end to it all
correct. when i was trying to track down the person who murdered my sister, apart from you gopher wood was my second suspect.
let's focus on the current situation right now. please help me!
you're right, miss himeko. we'll be using the automaton stealth bomb to cover our tracks.
look, it's common sense and easy, right?
that sounds sensible enough. since you went through the trouble of gathering the family head, the crew, and the stellaron hunters, i'm guessing you have something important to say, mister gallagher?
sure, i guess now's not really a good time for stories don't worry -- i can sum it up in a single sentence.
oh? a collaboration between our two sides, perhaps?
if that's what they want to do, then so be it. i've long passed the stage of working just for money.
how did the conversation get so heavy again!? no good -- let's talk about something interesting.
many years have passed since the two of you departed the xianzhou, and yet the circumstances of your return appear to be equally unhappy. if you still thought of me as a friend, you should've forewarned me.
you possess great cunning. deliberately setting us up to be on opposing sides, constantly repeating the words of the emanator in front of others, leaving me no choice but to draw my blade against you.
hold still and don't move three, two, one
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley
well, i guess that's that. we're on our own now. let's keep going.
speaking of the oak family head where is he now?
no, i came here to help my cloud knight coworkers get medication for their bruises and swelling.
...i ended that man's life, alone.
huh? the next puzzle? i didn't sign up for this.
that's why i was sent here -- to reassure them.
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
the charmony festival is about to start, and time is against us. we must hasten.
if i'm not mistaken, the containers in the trove of verdure can be moved around using a control panel.
so, am i right to see your act of betrayal at the dean's office as a ruse to teleport us to safety here?
i learn the most valuable lessons from my past opponents. please say whatever's on your mind.
that's enough knowing the enemy for now. come on, i want to see what the ring looks like.
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
she has come specifically for you.
now that i think on it, we did hear sounds akin to swallowing and other movements from the "cave..."
after that, general huaiyan took me in and treated me like his own granddaughter. to me, he is a hundred times better than my sinful father. he taught me forging and swordsmanship.
on what basis do you believe he's incapable, necessitating the delegation to someone from a rival faction, the ipc?
it makes sense that there are many merchants who oppose the merchant guild and support the ipc.
if there were, they left a long time ago. there might be valuable information here shame we don't have time to look for it.
it's hard to find the music you want on the streaming platforms managed by the ipc. i, for one, had to subscribe to at least a dozen of them.
who would have imagined that i would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? no, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
where did the express' conductor come from?
ah, that's right. as a small token of compensation for playing that little trick on you with the empty light cone, i will gift you with some words -- they hold great significance to me
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
i see the sky-faring commission has really gone all out as the host. interesting
when the vidyadhara are reborn, they are as fish that have returned to the ocean it is a state of complete freedom. that i may glance upon him from the shore is enough for me.
your arrival is timely -- this dreamscape is fraught with danger. since our destination is the same, how about we join forces?
and the room on the other side was the toy room. i loved spreading out all the toys from the box on the floor and making up stories for each of them.
but the trailblazing expedition ahead is always full of unknowns, and my blade is sharp enough to sever fate... as long as we maintain our original resolve, i believe there will come a day when we will meet again.
i commend your stamina for recounting that interminable tale -- you must be exhausted. my ears certainly are.
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
my lady, i... i'm very touched, but...
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
what do you mean? that's me too, y'know. the "me" that my patients see, at least.
interesting... i'll have to have a closer look some time.
while i lack the will to trailblaze, nor can i become a true nameless
haha, let's go then. first, we need to think of a way to get to the other side.
i sincerely wish that this will be our last meeting.
i updated the data bank entries today if you wanted to look anything up.
this snow is mesmerizing
a stellaron? that's impossible.
miss qingque has restored more parts of the record?
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
if my guess is correct, it's probably boothill checking in under pom-pom's name.
really? i find that hard to believe
whether it's helping her test some new specimen, or looking for ancient documents i've never even heard of...
seele's usually always out on patrol here at this time
remember you are still on the luofu. try not to go too wild!
it's okay it's not like i even know what she looked like
so what you're saying is the "engine of creation" was a weapon constructed by the belobogians themselves?
i see. if the express has been swallowed
it sure is but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
this way this is where we part ways. all of this is like a nightmare.
well, if it isn't franz, long time no see! you're still watching the entrance?
ahhhh, which means what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
nice to meet you too hehe, you're very polite.
haha, i wish!
to begin with, let's set him to scent detection mode~
the second jigsaw piece. is this a pair of wings, or a decoration made of feathers?
this mural portrays the vidyadhara young. they acquire knowledge and depart for different places on the xianzhou -- thereby dedicating themselves to serving the alliance.
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
sorry for all this trouble. yunli told you quite a bit. now, it's time for this old man to tell my side of the story.
hold on, it seems to be intentionally guiding us toward there
i'm sorry, my dear. my dream dance partner i've already got sights on someone else.
huh? can coffee get rid of dark circles under your eyes? no wonder it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission
but i know you're going to say "but," right?
these kids found way more than we did fixing all those robots what an embarrassment
both parties don't have to be aware that this is a farewell.
how did it manage to bypass the sky-faring commission's inspections and the divination commission's predictions? where is it now?
see, my mechanical hand is made by the craftsmen in the underworld. the techniques they used are the best in belobog.
there's much you don't know about the space station, and even more about herta.
*sigh* i guess i don't have any special insights. i think i think we should ask the merchants what they think.
you flatter me. fortunately, i did my research, or this conversation would've been quite dry.
does "miss sparkle's body" even count as a real character?
miss black swan, we fully understand our current predicament now. going back to your original suggestion
belobog's architects talk about the great deeds of qlipoth all the time. in our minds, qlipoth represents the single greatest power in the universe.
i made a clone, but it doesn't hold a candle to the emanator.
when the swarm disaster began to take hold, tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple aeons.
look down there. see the mess that remains of those old stalls? that's rivet town's market. the supplies natasha wants are probably there.
building a better world for future generations sound great, right? but is it any fun for the engineers and architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
seeing that you sense something is amiss, are you looking to defend me and clear my name of suspicion?
i see it's fine if you'd prefer not to discuss further.
but miss jade, this is
it really seems like something that was thrown together rather quickly. its creator most likely didn't consider whether the system would function properly or not
gray hair, don't be so nervous.
is that so well, i respect your choice.
i don't think so. i think he may be perceiving an unfamiliar presence.
while many of the roads that akivili traveled along no longer exist, i think it's still meaningful to record our adventures as current passengers of the express.
it's a long story
i can assure you that the guards are not here to seize power. if it takes time for the people to trust us, so be it. we're willing to take small measures and serve as an auxiliary force to wildfire to help maintain peace.
there must be some robot shells lying around the machine graveyard. everyone calls it a graveyard, but there are actually lots of useful parts buried there.
that's why i'm convinced that there are a few big secrets lurking behind the scenes.
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
that is a normal reaction. most organic lifeforms will experience discomfort after undergoing beacon projection. what do you see?
oh? you two are closer than i expected with her.
i've already concocted some of the medicine in question, but there can't be any further delays. could you assist me in ensuring it arrives on time?
i don't know. that depends on your friend.
a second-hand account, she wasn't at the scene. hearsay hardly counts as compelling evidence, now, does it?
acheron, the galaxy ranger?
time to get to work. let's prepare ourselves and meet that esteemed "supporting actor."
i gotta make this clear: i have nothing to do with this fella! you have to trust me-- miss hook, please don't point that thing at me, it's scary!
something came up in dan heng's schedule, and he couldn't make it. i have an idea -- could you reassign his room? it's still the same number of people.
like i told you. that guy barely leaves his nest -- it's rare to see him away from the furnace core. even when he does appear, he doesn't stick around for long. he leaves everything to his subordinates.
that's true. and that's why i'm also here for another purpose -- to visit hoolay.
something doesn't seem right. i need to leave for a moment. you can stay here with the receptionist.
the disciples of sanctus medicus were deeply rooted and had been plotting for a long time. i admit it was my negligence for not noticing it earlier.
hmm hey! those look like handprints on the side of the cabinet -- human handprints. could this monitor have been recently used by someone?
how about we start with your name? now, should we call you misha? or
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
you're such a hoot, buddy. this is penacony, of course you're in a dream!
they're getting ready to attack! those miners are unarmed.
did you ever hear tell of a planet where there is no concept of grotesquery? even more intriguing -- the people there have no concept of beauty, either.
but of course, not everyone disagrees with your idea.
let me introduce you to robin. she woke up from ena's dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
"one and only" is the name of my spaceship. i must admit, keeping her in good order can be a chore. perhaps i shouldn't have etched such intricate patterns into the fuselage.
actually, i'm not too sure how long it takes to see a doctor. let's meet up with lynx at the divination commission first.
wanna explore fyxestroll garden with me? i know we're gonna get to the truth this time.
cirrus may not know the location of tail, but they still figured out a way to divert everyone's attention.
she told me that the high-cloud quintet once gathered and feasted here hundreds of years ago.
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
the express feels quite different
dunn, this concerns the fate of belobog -- no -- the fate of our whole world. please don't stand in our way
i never thought that, while we were processing our entry papers at the sky-faring commission, we would run into another surprise
...before we part, can you answer one more question? as someone who has traveled on that road, can you tell me...
the buyer is waiting there, time to head over.
as for the simulated universe if that's the reason you're here, maybe i can help in answering your questions.
there were some very valuable images on that film, and we hadn't gotten around to making a backup i must admit, the thieves chose a good target, and they were fast and efficient.
you know what we are? accomplices. you know what that means? partners in crime! you know what else that means? we are not friends!
i don't see any issue with it. let march give it a shot. as long as she trains diligently, i believe she can easily deal with that hunk of ipc scrap metal.
a "warp trotter" that's a pretty rare aether spirit but they were acting kind of strange in the battle -- is there something wrong with them?
her ultimate goal was always the aether cartridge, but she developed an alternative objective in challenging herta and me in the process.
none of the important figures have arrived yet looks like the conference won't be starting for a while.
picture a sliver made up of beautiful dust, gases, and tiny specks, twirling around your finger like a captivating plum-colored mist.
oh, i love hero stories! tell me more when you have time!
my friend, let's be honest. that woman named "acheron" isn't as simple as you thought. did she say she's a galaxy ranger?
how's it going? has there been any progress?
that's settled then! there's no time to lose -- we should head out as soon as you're ready.
everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. the greatest wish of the local pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the gilded hour.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
lady bronya's inaugural address will begin soon. she asked me to pass on her invitation to you.
with the allowance grandpa gave me, we'll be able to have a huge meal! no, three huge meals!
fights like these don't go unnoticed in exalting sanctum -- cloud knights could show up any minute better get going.
luka, there wasn't ever any doubt in your technique and strength. but you were too concerned with winning, and that prevented you from unleashing your utmost.
i'm sure you're aware of the high level of risk i'll be undertaking to bring the truth to light.
there are still many guests arriving here. please be cautious!
and that's why i secured an internship opportunity at pier point with the help of xiaohan. once i wrap up here, i'll be on my way.
uh, why are you talking like that? is this some sort of artistic performance that young people are into these days?
i wouldn't waste too much energy on this matter. why not make the most of the festive atmosphere?
nobody knows why svarog did any of this he usually doesn't leave the furnace core and interfere unless some kind of disorder breaks out in the underworld.
how's that sound? one-third is a lot of money -- think about it! i would never dare to rip off a valued client such as yourself!
you really don't need to, just leave it to me. camping is about relaxing -- no need to be so tense.
that's right. my people are busy collecting clues now. what's the situation, moze?
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
of course. it's business, after all. what's important is where you're seated at the table.
in the beginning, we defined the simulated universe as a miniature world that could be used to discover the traces of the aeons. but now, it's become something far removed from its original purpose.
the "super electromagnetic flux player," or "electric guitar" for short.
i don't mind revealing my true colors if it helps me teach students and treat patients. but in my experience, it's usually counterproductive.
right now, there are only two things missing from my grasp: the meaning behind the truth and the means to expose it.
anyway, i learned a lot from them. i'm very grateful for that.
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza
to give a common example did you know that to varying degrees, most xianzhou natives are plagued by oral diseases and jaw-related conditions?
although mister sunday did not cross paths with the path of beauty, his actions were no different from the omen of evil. a lamentable soul lost on the path of righteousness... truly a matter of deep regret.
it's finally time to get back to bed. goodbye, everyone.
my master and seele both think that i talk too much. i wonder if dan heng thinks the same.
huh? is his past really that dark?
if the residents of dreamflux reef hope to tide over the crisis without the family's help, they will have to sing their very own song of harmony. this is why i'm here.
the ten-lords commission will support your decision with everything we have, general.
i am dan heng. it is an honor to meet you, miss bailu.
really!? then where is the real satelleden? will i have the chance to go see it with the express?
presumably miss sparkle is now carefully arranging the next crime scene, right?
and just moments ago, hoolay was executed by the cloud knights.
what about the yaoqing messengers and the nameless?
but you cannot run from combat, dan heng. your spearmanship is identical to imbibitor lunae's.
i haven't gotten close to voicing the extent of the underworld's grievances, young lady. but i will respect your request. i will leave it at that, for now.
you're right. our reason for coming here is not purely selfless. if we don't seal the stellaron, we cannot leave this planet.
listen up, kid. i don't mind delaying this transport for a few more days. once the engines are repaired, our ship will leave immediately, and you won't have any reason to inspect the cargo.
fragmentum activity is intensifying something's happening on jarilo-vi.
that's the enemy attack alarm every silvermane guard in the reserve zone just became our enemy.
combat is like smelting -- purging the impurities with burning flames and exposing a person's true nature.
hanguang was my beloved disciple, a rare genius not seen in the flamewheel forge since yingxing.
among the knights of beauty, i am one of the honorclad -- we are distinguished by our engraved armor.
miss topaz, you mentioned accountability
i understand the one i wished to trace exists now only in memory. but it's probably what's best for him.
finally, all preparations leading up to the climax are in place.
well, either we reason with them or charge straight through the blockade let's play it by ear!
miss jade? greetings. the opening ceremony for the charmony festival has been moved to the radiant feldspar, so i'm here making some preparations.
that's why they call you boss svarog! how about this!?
that video will soon circulate, and this station's fate? flames, nothing but flames.
we all train under grandpa's guidance, learning the art of craftsmanship and swordplay. that's how we got that title, i guess.
understood, i'll bring them back. the guards and wildfire have set up defenses on the bridge. you should head over.
guys, i feel like this is just some sort of prank or a marketing stunt to boost ticket sales.
you weren't that early, either still, i don't blame you -- you hadn't seen mom and dad in a long time i'm glad you managed to speak to them.
i just had quite an interesting conversation with himeko and mister yang.
so, following the clues in the script, i came up with some theories about the meme. that's why i instructed silver wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel
perhaps i'll find the answer i'm looking for on this journey. and when that day comes, it'll be farewell.
i told you, it's purely out of a spirit of competitiveness.
that's just it -- there is no deal
after i told pom-pom about peppy's shedding, they shared some cooking tips that should help solve the problem.
by the way, sorry for keeping that whole thing about her being the actual leader of wildfire a secret. hahaha
music is a language that spans the stars, and a solo performance is like a speech, which i know a thing or two about.
it is time for the soul-soothing ceremony. please make your way to earthrise agora in starskiff haven.
looks like the general has given me a tough challenge. he wants me to try and help put the ipc's mind at ease.
at ease, wraith warden. these two are not your enemies.
you compromised quicker than i thought. unfortunately, it's a gambler that needs a bargaining chip not a merchant. i can give you your gift money, but before that, i want you to tell me --
hearing you speak so highly of it has piqued my curiosity. would you mind showing me around?
i can't imagine it how will i feel when i have to face pascal after being forgotten so many times?
i have matters to attend to, feel free.
lastly, trial of the self. one places oneself within that pressure to complete a transformation.
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet
and those tracks and metal scratches we noticed earlier
in herta's words, there was no loser in that fight.
a planet covered in snow and ice will i find my answer here?
she's also in the running for the legacy how is she going to sneak into the dreamscape unnoticed?
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence
i might have gone astray, but others shouldn't have to clean up after my mistakes.
you guys didn't know? the wardance has a "popularity revival" rule. if eliminated contenders or teams garner enough popularity votes in online polls, they can participate in the repechage and re-enter the ring!
the more the merrier, these guys are nothing! hold the line!
if there's anything the sky-faring commission or the cloud knights can do for you during your stay, don't hesitate to make it known.
there's no need for that. this was merely a transaction.
he's very cunning. according to leads provided by citizens, he's got his hands on a number of ancient relics. he sold off most of them, but it seems he's using others to commit various frauds.
my apologies for rambling on just now
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
the heliobi are like a flame that burns eternal, with no need for sustenance. but alas, their curiosity got the best of them, and they became prisoners of humans. it is a pity.
every once in a while, i'll need them to get me things from other planets, and they often come to me to help them solve problems.
wildfire i don't know anything about them. in all my time above ground, i never heard of this organization.
but if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then i hope its existence proves to be real.
since mister luka is really popular, he'll definitely clear the popularity revival vote and return! please cheer him on!
so dangerous you're lucky to have lived till now.
thereafter, a mysterious galaxy ranger arrived on penacony, checking into the hotel with only a music box... do you still need me to continue the story, my friend?
i suggest that you make some concessions to appease the merchants. if you don't follow mingxi's plans for the dock, she will temporarily take over your position.
he doesn't look like the type, but that sounds about right.
i see the stories about this world are truly captivating.
when i was still one of the architects working in the scientific research division, i was researching the stellaron.
i was talking to mister yang about my career as a mechanic and my time in the silvermane guards. somehow, we got onto that so-called engine of creation
i think i should refrain from violating the healers' orders any further -- the weariness is creeping up on me once again. time to lie down.
hahaha, that's all you wanna ask? i don't necessarily tell master oleg everything, you know.
this is not a punishment at all, and i gladly accepted it! spreading the message of beauty to the xianzhou residents is exactly what i desire.
these crates have been sitting here for many years, right? even if they have materials in them, are you sure they are still usable?
i've been ready for a long time.
a jade seal used by the shipwrights. it opens various passages.
master diviner, i've brought you the guests, though it wasn't your order i received.
mister dan heng showed me the express' data bank just now.
case in point, i've only been here for a while, but i'm already kinda missing the taste of the underworld air. hahaha!
i agree with you, black swan. that's why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...
heh, that's alright. in these times of conflict, for the sake of utmost safety, it is only right that the alliance steps forward to mediate on behalf of the astral express. we must not allow you to take unnecessary risks.
i'm just following the doctor's advice. miss bailu said i could take a stroll, so here i am.
if only i had talked to you from the beginning, grandpa maybe things wouldn't have escalated like this.
just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the nihility...
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
during prior unrest instigated by the ever-flame mansion, some testified to seeing "miscreants materialize from the inferno."
that's why i went into vacation mode the second i boarded the express -- thesis topics don't unearth themselves y'know.
the box in which the cornerstone is stored.
sorry... i'll get it fixed later.
how'd you like that story? i even came up with a scary version -- wanna hear it?
topaz shared with me the story of the stellaron's descent upon jarilo-vi -- how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
unfortunately, too much time has passed to verify that. penacony is just a small territory, and even the family heads with their authority cannot enter the sacred site of the harmony and inquire about the true will of the great one.
looks like the tuskpir not only regenerates rationality, it also destroys it. now that'd make for an interesting research topic.
i hope i won't meet member #four polka kakamond. that would be quite troublesome.
alright. if we happen to come across that yaoqing messenger who got away
but, the gate didn't move an inch
it's time to go back and chat with lady asta and mister screwllum.
haha, i see. this is my first time leaving belobog to compete in outer space.
it's a relief to see you safe and sound, miss robin.
have you found out who the killer is?
if it's that mysterious could you let me take a look, so i can better understand its mysteriousness?
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
it's the same with gepard. i could tell it took a lot for him to lay down his arms.
you cannot leave yet -- your astral express friends are waiting for you in scalegorge waterscape. shall we go and see them together?
all three from the yaoqing are critically injured, but fortunately, the xianzhou luofu has a miraculous healer lady. it's a silver lining in this misfortune.
during my days in the shackling prison, reading books was my only respite from the long hours and the shadows of the past.
cut it out and go home, you slick talker. we are fools, but we aren't stupid. we aren't interested in playing the friend game with the lapdogs of the ipc.
d--don't worry lynxy! i'm sure you'll get concrete proof one day
well, where would we be without our squad leader? we had to help!
and even after you arrived, i didn't suppose i'd be the one to be liberated of that duty.
you and i both strive for a peaceful society, even if our reasons are different, and you've gone even further than i have.
what do you mean by "unable to reach" them?
yes, but not exactly. to be more precise
a master of the chessboard does not always make flashy moves. people take delight from one flashy move that saves the day, but never worry when the entire situation teeters towards a loss.
what are you laughing at? you've got pink-hair, too!
that would make sense. i'm sure a lot of miners are injured, right? *sigh* if everyone could just get along, things would be easier
does it feel like the skysplitter has slowed down? could it be
the astral express tracks our coordinates in real time and with such a huge change in the space station's movements, there's no way mister yang wouldn't have noticed.
(now that i think about it, something's not right. why would they rendezvous at a military airfield?)
it's still early, so why don't we get some tea at the alchemy commission? we can discuss your suggestions for revitalizing the commission.
oh, it's you. the door's not locked. come in.
xianzhou is capable of such bustling trade because of how amicassadors such as tingyun socialize so much with the outsiders.
never heard of it. sounds made up. sparkle doesn't sound like a real name, either.
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved"
the memories i have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
please, begin your statement -- and try to think before you speak.
they don't seem to care much about "death"... instead, they're more concerned about the charmony festival and the watchmaker.
we soon became the most elite fighter pilots of the sky-faring commission. it wasn't an easy life you could even say it was a cruel one.
wait a second! let's all just calm down! is there something wrong with the source of this stuff? i mean, i've got nothing to do with it
congratulations on becoming the interastral tournament festival champions!
no, but we've been invited -- we certainly don't want to be late.
please leave pascal to me. it was my decision to keep him in the first place, so i must take full responsibility.
a violation of the rules and regulations. i would like to remind you, lady fu, that the xianzhou comes before its rules and regulations -- all the more so in times of crisis.
when should we schedule the formal negotiations? i'll handle the arrangements.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
yes, i don't want her to spend her whole life trapped under her father's shadow she doesn't deserve to carry the weight of his mistakes.
every wig brings out a different style. it feels like a new challenge every time i try a different do!
who's to say i won't sell you out?
you could say that! but the main reason i'm here is to take part in the championship!
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
i have one more question for you, miss jade.
and it's likewise for me. i have a wish i want to achieve so badly in the real world, but i can't. so, i want to give it a shot here
but don't think we'll just hand over the mastery mark without a fight -- you'd better make sure you're ready before you even think about challenging us!
as long as we insert memories containing the ninja memetic virus into the synesthesia dreamscape, it will overwrite the existence of slumbernana monkey in the dream.
however, before the prelude to the future begins, please take a moment to ponder the questions i've posed
then you said: you asked asta for help with the lost curio.
i am saying nothing of the sort, just raising a doubt, that's all. please be careful, benefactors
it's getting late, i won't be staying up much longer. sleep well.
my "own" way ha, i don't even remember what kind of life i want.
we now have the additional capacity to work with more businesses and have also opened a new route leading to the port. with streamlined logistics planning, i think we'll see a revitalized alley in no time!
should you decide to try again, my offer still stands but you must defeat them.
good idea, why don't you take a look around, benefactors? my feet need a rest.
i've been monitoring the dark web -- i barely managed to stop the video from spreading. the incident hasn't grown any bigger -- for now. how are things with you?
i've also heard that the board once considered spending a fortune to buy out the astral express and to make it part of their business however, all their offers were quickly declined.
um not quite my taste. "high speed" doesn't quite do the express justice.
i'm not there. turn back.
i must say, i'm quite honored, mister screwllum, but do explain -- why opt for silent wisdom when you already had the pieces of the puzzle?
you're right. i won't enjoy myself if i turn it into another safety inspection.
i'm just a little curious. isn't it really tiring for miss sparkle to play so many different roles?
have you talked with these disciples, benefactor? what do you make of them?
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
i'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *primal dreamscape*. how lucky.
that's right. from what i recall, we have to touch these stone lanterns in a particular sequence to unlock the seals in this area.
i'll call for a messenger to take you to the interrogation division. you just need to give your testimony and then you can head back. so, no need to worry.
you know what? mister yang got me excited about it too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
as elder huaiyan suggests, the luofu will do its best to heal the wounded and compensate those who were affected. we aim to reopen the wardance in the coming weeks.
but i've already told you.
gentlemen, our preliminary inspection shows that there is indeed hidden biological tissues inside, just like the craftsman feared.
it takes a long time to reach the other side on foot. how about we just bounce over there using the pinball machine!
i've decided to forge an exclusive mask for you!
isn't it fascinating how variables never fail to find their way into the lives of organic lifeforms?
that skit before said that the deceased was strangled. is this tie some kind of joke murder weapon?
this crate looks promising. maybe there are spare stove components inside
it's been a while, my friends on the astral express. how's your trailblazing expedition going?
just tell everyone on our team to stay focused on their tasks and not worry about the negotiations.
hmm? what happened?
have you ever seen anyone outside of the crew interact with misha?
starskiffs are blocked from entering or exiting. there's no way the fugitive got through
i don't want to frighten you, but the truth is you won't ever be in the clear while it is still inside your body.
just come see me at the dock when you have time.
but no matter how gepard and i asked and probed, lynx simply refused to tell us who she was gonna meet *sigh* i'm such a failure of a sister.
it's arlan's shoe size alright -- and this actually came from a pair of shoes i bought for him.
the model in the sandpit... it's the golden hour, isn't it?
but i don't, because it's not appropriate to do so in public -- you should make sure everything is presentable and in order before leaving the house.
just like you said, miss lingsha, casting a creature that can't be killed into a star would be a way to permanently get rid of it, but unfortunately
the overworld? not really interested. unless, of course, there's a worthy opponent up there, or a bully that needs a good lesson.
he's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
mechanics, research, and music are all things i'm pretty good at, wouldn't you say? but i guess making money's not on the list
aha, i see. herta's collections aren't in the system, so anything unaffected should be our target.
walking alone in the darkness, fearing every incoming, invisible obstacle, unable to understand other people's descriptions
huh? ah i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
come on, asta has been worried about all of you.
general feixiao just slipped out of the recovery room. she thinks she's so sneaky, but i know everything that happens in the alchemy commission.
what is it? you seem pretty off today, serval
they should return to their senses. attacking the dragon lady only destroys what little prestige they have remaining.
qingni! where are you going?
it probably should have been "phase." he saw member #twenty-nine sserkal's research topic in this booklet and verified his hypothesis.
the moment news spreads about penacony going public, trillions of customers will immediately receive a message like this:
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though
my purpose? haha, you're funny. what else can i do in penacony? well, i just hang around, daydream, and do the things that anyone on vacation would do.
don't worry. even if we end up dying here, i won't let it happen to you first.
a deadly button, huh?... i guess the family didn't take your threats seriously at all? otherwise, how on earth did you manage to bring it in here?
father was a soldier. he wasn't supposed to question the orders from his superiors
regarding this "stellaron" and your predicament in the overworld, your friends have gone over both with me again.
no problem! the rules are actually quite simple. to start with, i've made some minor tweaks to the snowshine lamps, making it possible for heat to be transferred between them
no. as you just pointed out, that kind of thing is easily replaced.
everyone's so knowledgeable, and super easy to talk to
uh i might not be a scholar, but i don't think calling someone a "hawk" is a compliment.
well, how could they expect to attract people to come and watch if they didn't make a huge spectacle? march, you haven't forgotten what you came to do, have you?
stellaron hunters the general was merciful enough to let you live, but you haven't shown the slightest bit of gratitude.
of course, sam and silver wolf would have broken us out, but bladie would've been gravely injured, and our relationship with the xianzhou would've been damaged beyond repair.
get hold of the stellaron before cocolia realizes what's happening!
perhaps it's best to let go now, while my feelings for pascal aren't as strong?
*sigh* you did save my life at cloudford consider this my returning the favor.
if we had a little more time, i could have even convinced her i was xipe the harmony.
are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
i can't say i blame you -- we're nothing alike in personality or interests.
and an easy one to test. neither of us is part of the cast or a crew member. let's try it out.
yeah, i'm up for that! and if i kick your butt, you'll drop out of the wardance. deal?
i'm all set. i'm going to win this.
that is a tall order, but i'm counting on you.
let's look around. when i see it, i will know it.
an outstanding piece of musical work is just like a mirror. only through comparison and reflection can shortcomings be found in time.
the first glimmer of light in the prolonged night often illuminates little, as it is fleeting and the darkness too vast.
i heard mister yang was once the leader of a secret organization and saved a whole planet! not to mention he's been a teacher, and even a storyboard artist! *sigh* he must be an alien or something
farewell, nameless.
so miss sushang's team is really popular then?
once you draw your sword you must strike down your adversary in one blow without turning back.
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
if i'm their target, why would they come after bailu?
that doctor advised me to walk around the town, and see more of the sights.
i just stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
wow, you can endure that much? truly, a heart of ice you've got there. hey, maybe we could actually get along?
you are guests from afar -- there is no reason for this matter to concern you am i making myself clear?
no one gets left out of my stories!
you remember the robots we defeated in the boxing gym?
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
you all have saved belobog from danger time and time again. we don't have much, but we'd like to say thank you with this small gesture.
since when did the work roster just change like that?
you really shouldn't drink so much soulglad, my friend. it's not good for your health.
does this "true taste" have anything to do with that mikhail?
why did you not tell your companions about my true identity?
of course, i didn't want to make things too difficult, so i spun you a broad web wasn't that nice?
haha, and that is something i must deal with myself.
normally it'll only take around forty-seven star calendar years.
i didn't manage to beat you previously. "mathematically speaking," i'm afraid i'll suffer the same fate this time.
it's about being observant at all times and carefully making the best choice for the situation. you can do it too.
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
a good question! maybe not all dreams are false well, at least the ones in penacony aren't. or perhaps should i say they are another reality.
the future for humanity is like the sky for birds. people mistakenly believe that flight is inherent to birds because they've never witnessed those birds crashing to their death.
i'm heading out. i hope the next time we meet, we'll both have several more victories to our names.
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
of course, i know i'd never be able to wield such a sword, but i'd still love to see it
fine, i'm just spitballing here. don't take it so seriously
so you mean you're refusing?
the sky-faring commission went toe to toe twelve times against the plagues author in the past. three times we were nearly wiped out, but each time we rose up from the ashes and rebuilt.
you haven't answered my question about why hoolay was imprisoned in the luofu instead of the yaoqing, general. you've been reserved in your response. could it be that such an arrangement wasn't an honor?
and that man he was never a failure. like everyone in that world, he etched the possibilities of human nature into his heart.
i never thought i'd make such an embarrassing blunder when buying a present for a dear friend for the first time. a thousand apologies.
ugh, it's ghostly grove, not ghastly gravy!
here, these rewards are for you. i hope they come in handy on the journey ahead.
wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. everything we do is for the citizens of the underworld. that passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns?
thank you. i don't have any further questions.
look at the lens when you're taking a photo the next time -- your expression will look more natural.
don't worry. this tuskpir is a personal pet of mine. i can lend it to you for this treatment, but you have to take good care of it for me.
right! ever since the sedition of imbibitor lunae, the title of sword champion has gone unclaimed. but once everything settles down and the combat arts ceremony returns, it's a title i'm determined to win!
aren't you worried that the money you spent on me will go to waste?
it's common for cloud knight generals to face danger directly. hoolay has escaped, and the yaoqing envoy is being held hostage by the borisin. his fate is unknown. this is a grave matter.
but? there's no but. this is the truth.
then again, i know the rules, vigilance is the name of the game in our profession. it's my fault for letting my enthusiasm and sincerity get the better of me
it is pointless to discuss "what-ifs." you have won. your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.
don't worry, general. no matter what happens, i'm prepared to stay here as the express' witness, and answer any questions.
progress was really slow, but they managed to hunt down some new clues.
i haven't seen oleg. the miners said they saw him take a group further in.
it would seem we've cleared every abomination from the area. let's find another location and continue our contest.
i didn't have other options. the dreammaster has been elusive, and even the heads of the families can hardly get an audience with him.
your body was contaminated by the destruction and suffered severe damage. as i said before, these wounds will stay with you for the rest of your life.
for the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices it is the right choice.
who's this old guy with a white beard?
there's always a way for me to contact him if i need to, so don't worry!
oh? she heads up the force? hm not bad.
the nameplate reads: gulliver's arch. i'm amazed you can remember something this tiny. you know, this reminds me of a tunnel i once saw that could shrink people who passed through it.
do you have to ask every other minute, missy? two more steps, just two more steps and you're there.
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
this isn't a clue, it's just a brand of tea i liketwo cups a day keeps the tiredness at bay.
i'm merely performing the duty required of a master.
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
not much. we just chatted a bit.
these monsters are usually eager to fight -- you're guaranteed a fierce battle if you see one in the fragmentum
mm-hmm mm-hmm alright
a cursed sword may grant a warrior great power in an instant, but in the end, they will just be a walking corpse driven by the sword. victory is up to the wielder, not the sword.
but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge
huh! what you're saying is quite different from what her dual swords have been saying to me.
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
be that as it may, i don't remember anything. there's nothing to help me make a choice.
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
of course. for i am a child who received the blessing of gaiathra triclops.
so you're also saying the guards want to work with wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
i already do, miss acheron. you're a prominent figure in penacony.
haha, that's the whole point of a festival, right?
i don't think that's necessary. look, he's awake.
 then perhaps there won't be any reason for me to go on the journey with you after all.
big sis! let's go! i want to play in ever-hunt plains!
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
the hotel's dreampool provides a comfortable dream experience, so don't you worry about that!
*sigh* another half day gone, and nothing to show for it
ooh, you were tactful in the face of someone making things difficult for you. however, the assistant director doesn't like to be praised for her appearance.
you never know something very exciting might happen!
but the future is still clear -- the real test lies ahead the young swordmaster of the cloud knights. he will not be an easy foe.
don't forget to continue learning new stuff even after you've found a job!
hey! that's sparkle who's saying all that! she doesn't represent the masked fools!
and there i was thinking you gangsters still had some decorum.
it doesn't have to be like that. i'm willing to answer all your questions, but not right now... if my cover hadn't been blown, we might have had more time, but at the moment, we don't have any other options.
well then, this will be the main course for tonight -- i'll show you what i can do as a chef!
haha, too many to count. then again, these admission documents will take us a while to complete -- i'll see if i can dig up any stories for you.
not yet. i have things i wish to convey to my astral friends.
they need our help. we have to deal with these monsters first before advancing further.
upon examining it for a moment, i found that the beauty was described as such in the data bank: their disappearance and birth are equally mysterious.
before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
thank you, master. this is my greatest honor.
this section of information doesn't mention the xianzhou alliance at all i wonder how he fought his way to the luofu.
diplomacy before violence. we should try peaceful communication first.
of course. my word is my bond. i said that i'd stand with you to the end, and i won't go back on that promise.
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
of course i do, i've understood them for a while now. but as far as i can tell, she doesn't need other people's understanding. she needs to understand her own heart.
could i really "stay where i am" with you two risking your lives to save me?
so, do let me know when you have more stories to share. i'm sure the kids will love them.
(didn't take pu'er for a man of rules.)
to you, my dear audience, i dedicate my performance i wonder, did i bring a little more joy into your lives?
welcome, dear guests from the express. judge hanya of the interrogation division, we've met before.
then i'll grant you even greater rewards.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
feel free. this is open to everyone on the express.
incredible, gambler. have you already exhausted your limited repertoire of tricks so soon?
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
maybe he's just trying to get you two to move faster, or he just wants to provoke you given his nature, this "elite player" might even be him.
why not talk about it? maybe everyone's thinking the same thing?
we're not taking a photo!
what should we do first see a doctor, or go to the divination commission?
has the ipc finished sharing all its thoughts? then it's our turn.
i've been browsing through some of the stories on ghostly grove myself -- they make for good reading.
you sigonians are notorious throughout the entire universe! liars, thieves, social manipulators, wolves in sheep's clothing you're really living up to the reputation.
hahaha, you're too kind. compared to mister giovanni, i'm practically a novice.
not much different from what you're seeing now. i modeled it after how i looked, back when i was a kid. it might not be identical, but i'd say maybe seventy, eighty percent there?
later, during the three sufferings era, the luofu's ecosystem underwent a sudden change. these gentle giants bore the brunt of the change, and forever disappeared down the river of time.
sheriff, the murderer is wright. the evidence is the stool, right?
yes, i agree. dealing with the garden of recollection is dangerous, and the trade of memories is a shady business.
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know
ugh, why do they have to call me for such a trivial matter sorry, something just came up at work, i've got to get going!
nature is always accompanied by predation and sacrifice its antithesis is known as order.
robots aligned against humans? i've never heard of such a thing. machines should obey humans unconditionally
i too was once a non-believer -- i fooled myself into acquiring artificial eye implants soon thereafter, my sightless eyes began to regenerate, and i was left in pain and despair
(luocha's personality changes by the minute)
so, why are you so focused on sparkle's challenge? or should i ask are you more focused on sparkle herself?
that's right -- you were just a victim of the heliobus's trickery, diviner fu -- no need to blame yourself.
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
that sounded like a story from ancient times and why did the facial recognition system suddenly go out?
but we still don't have any weapons in hand
in the end, we still came full circle.
how often do you get the chance to work with yourself? just imagine how in sync we'll be with one another we're bound to thrive and prosper!
i just hope the monster didn't get to them.
this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
the reason for sealing the furnace core still needs to be investigated. in addition, it appears that sampo has secret connections that grant him passage between here and the surface. that may come in useful to us.
that city -- belobog -- it seems like such a lonely place and yet it's full of masterful fighters. when i get time, i want to take a look there.
there you are. that last showdown was intense -- it reminded me of my own time competing in the silvermane guards' martial contests.
hmm the geomarrow fuel activation component probably stopped working. do you have a spare one?
i have prepared a big gift for all of you -- the "outline" for the next act. you'll see once you open it.
in any case, this fiasco has been going on right under our noses for too long. regardless of how cunning and talented the culprit may be, we must draw them out and demonstrate the resolve of the architects.
ahh, i'm just messing with you -- lighten up!
looks like i did get you all wrong. you're not a feeble scholar, but a sinister and despicable one.
a meticulously thought out and interesting suggestion. it'll make for a novel gift. let's go with that.
it would seem our enormous, hideous enemy... is right outside!
that's true. i wouldn't be here if it weren't for aventurine.
but the most important thing a leader needs is a strong heart. an ability to unite everyone toward a common cause. in that respect, no one in the underground comes close to her.
a lot of the researchers on the station live off coffee. they said it helps them focus.
yes. i've gone through countless case studies and they all point to the same conclusion: any world that comes into contact with a stellaron is doomed.
unless you enjoy trailblazing through two weeks of community service.
is that it? i thought you were gonna stay for at least a little longer
it's hard to tell if the master diviner won or lost here.
she reminds me of myself when i was a child -- i also had to find my way in the dark, face obstacles i couldn't predict, as well as deal with unconscious prejudices people had against me.
is there something about my name?
no, if it were only about revenge, they could just wreck the ship and destroy all the cargo, instead of allowing it to end up in the shackling prison.
i admire your vigilance what a shame. so many elixir seekers arrive on the xianzhou in the hope of obtaining the formula to immortality, but none have succeeded.
in the worst-case scenario, if xipe turned a blind eye, how could "the strong defending the weak" hold up?
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
i say "virtually" because of skott, of course lucky for us, he wasn't as smart as he thought he was.
okay, here we go
um... neither. i just wanted to know if you've ever heard about "death" in the dreamscape?
we shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of penacony or the family.
i did tell you to let me handle it. i don't have eyes in the back of my head -- what if i accidentally hit you?
i didn't expect someone who can't even hold onto his sword to actually have some skill.
hey, lynxy! come and have a look at this!
aside from the existing data, i also recorded this trip to the archives.
that's why i called the two of you here.
ah i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises
honestly, i feel that girl is hiding something from me. i knew cocolia well, and she was never one to suddenly change her mind.
but i lost, mister tail. i listened to that very important voice, and i lost terribly.
are you hungry, numby?
i'm lead researcher of herta space station. but honestly... i'm more like madam herta's "housekeeper" of this place.
oh, here you are. swordmasters should greet each other with their swords. old mettle, say hi!
many vagrants are staying here temporarily. their homes were overrun by monsters.
somebody save me from this cringe joke
the problem is, any suspicious incident could be tail-related when you think about it
so close and yet so far you'll have to pick up the pace.
on that note, mister micah, which tombstones are you referring to? we didn't come across any graveyard when we arrived.
what's wildfire up to? hmm are they avoiding me?
to reciprocate, in the upcoming confrontation, if the odds aren't in the astral express' favor... i will stand with you.
you could say that. i was still a child back then. to become the bronze melodia of the oak family, i'd gone under mister gopher wood's tutelage.
for now, just sit and wait. remember to close your eyes -- it helps with the dizziness.
i don't know much about science, but i'm glad to be able to protect people in pursuit of their research.
but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
"omni" makes it sound pretty capable, but the corporation released other models onto the market first. know why?
forgive me miss, but you were too busy being hit yourself. it's a good thing i joined the fray.
hmmm honest kid. i know where you are, miss sparkle.
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
let me remind everyone that we are at a hearing. mister president, please share with us your vision for aurum alley.
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
general jing yuan, general huaiyan, it's just as we suspected the rise of the ambrosial arbor was not the end of things, but the beginning.
yunli, i'm sure you understand why the official called you here, right?
herta called screwllum and i to the space station to discuss some important topics. she also sent an invite to stephen, but he didn't reply and herta didn't seem to want to wait any longer.
it's a long story. in any case, practically nothing moves up or down anymore.
i'm not sad. it's just that this dream is so loving and forgiving.
the xianzhou luofu has recently overcome a crisis. by holding the wardance, they're demonstrating to everyone that they've returned to a state of peace and safety.
hmm i didn't really give it much thought. but traveling with you bunch does always lead to unexpected surprises.
watch out for monsters. they like to hide. if you need to, clear the area before you dig for the supplies.
i also pay great attention to the ways of the world just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
it's okay if you haven't heard of us. i'll make sure the whole cosmos remembers belobog's name with my fists!
not only did the merlin's claw offer no reproach, she decided to go after hoolay herself to prevent further calamity. i believe the luofu owes her something in return for her fervent determination
oh i understand. you refused to let me go because you wanted to drag me into all of this! if i don't agree, i'll end up just like she did
just doing a little business. what's all the fuss?
come and have a walk with me. a stroll is the most appropriate post-dessert activity.
release your full potential -- the power you carry is the key to opening a way through to the ambrosial arbor.
good point! may as well see it through!
i couldn't have backed down, could i? besides, we got him good.
mm no wonder it's so heavily guarded.
hi there. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
truly a once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity... i've been investigating and making lots of friends all over penacony precisely for this very moment.
do you remember what i told you before? hunting is about thinking in the same way as your prey, not just mindlessly chasing after them.
return to the world? what are you saying?
i think i'll be coming to the express more often in the future the next time i'm here, i want to have more conversations, watch the universe, and eat some good food together with all of you!
sorry, i got a bit distracted there.
i was being sarcastic. can't you tell?
the stellaron incident may have been quelled, but who is to say that nobody has another agenda?
guards, formation! arrest these people. we could be inundated with fragmentum monsters at any moment, we have no time to waste on them!
from now on, no matter where you may go, no matter what hardships you may encounter as long as i am alive, the luofu will always be an open harbor to you
approval to launch an attack on the members of the astral express
i warned them that their business model wouldn't work on the xianzhou without adjustments but the merchant guild's overly traditional mindset is a different obstacle.
oh, there you are. sorry, i got distracted watching the crowds.
some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside bracelets and jewelry. we put the bigger ones into instruments of calculation so we can simulate the future and learn from the past.
so now, it's up to you to decide your next destination.
when general jing yuan was teaching me swordplay, he used to personally spar with me during crucial moments to assess my skills.
i picked up slivers of her thoughts in the memory zone. these will help you form an impression of her. now, you must hang on to these thoughts with all your might, and shape them in your mind.
have you all considered this? perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned akivili never reached
when the unthinkable happens, it usually comes down to the combat effectiveness of the defenders to gain the upper hand. but it's always helpful to have the right equipment by your side.
the real problem lies with the researchers... they trust madam herta wholeheartedly and never thought that the space station would be breached by the legion. a broken spirit is far worse than a broken body.
there are quite a few curios on the express that i've only seen in the catalogs, though i'll need to see them up close before i believe them...
we're here. the dewlight pavilion is the oak family's fortress and a place where heads of the families meet to discuss great plans for penacony.
the galaxy is huge. maybe there's some kind of organism that can become invisible visiting us
i've been on my feet all day. i don't have the energy for more headaches right now. let me catch my breath and i'll come find you tomorrow.
my time with you has been a great help to the luofu, and a great help to me. i want to say thank you, both publicly and privately.
huh? are you serious? fifteen% drop on opening?
never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
i don't know if they would open the vault door, but before i left, i witnessed a well-dressed pepeshi person plummet from the sky while those around him continued on their way, unfazed.
nat i how long do i have left?
well, looks like we'll have to swallow our pride and ask skott to abandon the duel.
i see this talent would do well in special effect films.
mm-hmm. i went back, stored my supplies, and had a shower. it didn't take long.
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
(i--it kinda works, right?)
it seems i won't be able to cast off dan feng's negative karma so i'd like to learn more about his past. i want to find out what i can do to make up for his sins.
you've already put on quite the show -- do you think you'll be able to find and operate the control panel? should be simple, right?
vanquishing general? isn't that title a bit too narcissistic? i don't like it.
don't worry. she stands out. she's blonde like us and, um quite short. she's always wearing a white fur hat if i'm right, she should be waiting for someone at the city exit closest to the snow plains.
let's go report to natasha in boulder town, it won't take long to get back.
time sure flies. now, both my sister and i are residents of the netherworld, and we will never again feel the thrill of a competition.
well, you've only been practicing swordplay for fifteen days. to even reach this point is already impressive.
apologies, mister micah, that we are only now bidding you farewell.
i'm sorry our business got in the way of a reunion with old friends. i'll get out of your way.
your technique was all over the place, and you relied too much on speed. is this really all the cloud knights of the luofu can muster? so disappointing.
*sigh* you never asked what the sky-faring commission does. i suppose not all commissions are created equal
it's a pity that we haven't had the chance to talk much, and now the express is about to leave. do you have any questions?
give me a few minutes, just a few. i'll explain every--
*sigh*, i'm not sure you guys will agree, but
our battle their battle it's just beginning.
she summoned me last night to tell me that you had deceived her. your identities and purpose here are counterfeit. you seek to overthrow the rule of the architects.
perhaps i'll remember more things if we go further
she did say that, but then what? you need to provide evidence to show incidents are linked.
let's go! next, we're gonna clear up all the fragmentum cronies still left in the settlement!
and thus i became the daughter of madam cocolia. my only identity is that of guardian successor, but i'm not good enough
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
the supreme guardian sacrificed herself to seal the stellaron. we were there at the fight -- we witnessed everything.
what is this? a brooch?
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
n--no, it's not that i've heard there are a lot of old energy hubs in the underworld, and you're probably the only person in belobog who knows how to inspect them.
anything else? if not, i'm hanging up.
it was a groundless accusation which only serves to make him seem more suspicious.
we shouldn't linger here too long. let's go back to the express for now.
still, when it comes to fighting on the front lines, you can put your life in his hands. there's a dozen of us in wildfire who are still in his debt not to mention ordinary underworlders.
diamond's been a great help to both of us. your antics on such a crucial day can't exactly have painted the strategic investment department in a good light, y'know?
so, that's how you managed to infiltrate the xianzhou ship. if i hadn't been so familiar with the scent of borisin, i wouldn't have been able to tell.
i wonder if the conductor might share some organizing tips with me.
here's to our future cooperation! if you wouldn't mind leading the way, mister svarog.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
ah, i remember! the three outsiders! wait -- why are you still strolling around the city? do you know the silvermane guards are looking all over for you?
it doesn't seem like it.
i thought i'd be really nervous, but i don't have the jitters at all! to say i'm not nervous at all isn't accurate how should i put it? i'm unusually calm!
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions
it's a pity we do not communicate much within the society, not to mention we've lost most of our members to the lord of silence. i have never heard of amphoreus, however.
oh? looks like everyone has come with expectations. care to share?
they are also followers of qlipoth, but what they do is drastically different from us architects. can businessmen honestly support the preservation? i'm seriously doubting their true motives
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
at this stage, i'm just taking it one step at a time.
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
if it is to happen sooner or later, i would rather it happen later now, let us both take a step back -- we needn't make this difficult.
the mainstream school of thought is that stellarons catalyzed the appearance of fragmentums.
it's been a long journey, elder huaiyan. thank you for your presence.
he's so young, but a cloud knight lieutenant already!? could he have a ma more strict than mine urging him on with swordplay?
master diviner, have you summoned us here just to sigh and complain?
then why did you still come here
anyway, as long as you're all right. i should return to my room too.
i understand. the luofu is in danger, and members of the six commissions should stand united.
if we hadn't happened to be passing by were you really planning to go into the fragmentum alone?
you guys figure it out for yourselves. i'm due to catch up with an old war friend i've not seen for quite a long time.
out of money already? the merchant guild has thrown together some funds try to spend it more slowly this time.
ultimately, this little trotter is your companion, and now they're a part of your journey.
i hope that she actually enjoys the art of medicine, and that it's not just a responsibility imposed on her but that seems to be a predicament most vidyadhara have to grapple with.
our job is to present them before her. nothing more.
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
one question per person, remember? the little one doesn't count.
are you serious? does that little dragon girl look like she's gonna come running over to us?
i understand the difficulties that this world is facing, supreme guardian. belobog's current financial burden cannot be pinned on you, nor anyone else for that matter.
a compliment!? continue
it's true, people love to label themselves.
workers from the logistics department said that you haven't claimed your merchant guild benefits yet. please don't forget to claim them.
he was seemingly up to no good and left a lasting psychological scar.
i will. but before i do
my fine fellow, please don't do that again. you scared the daylights outta me.
to solve the mystery of the watchmaker, it is crucial to get the ipc's intel. the path ahead is fraught with danger but what's trailblazing without a little danger?
however, i plan to leave the xianzhou soon and continue my travels. may our paths cross again in the vast cosmos, my dear friend.
say, aren't there any forms to fill out for boarding the express? no contract to be signed? how about a deposit? tsk, at least tell me there's a guarantee
huh? i can't see the memory storage for this terminal
what's in this plan, general feixiao?
are you guys ready? i'm going to play it.
i must have been chosen from among the children here and then taken to the surface
i saw tingyun in so many shops and just thought she was a customer who's always buying stuff then i heard all those shops are hers!
interesting, she's a member of the genius society alright.
my apologies for any perceived slight. to show my sincerity, i offer you ten thousand credits as a gesture of goodwill.
i don't remember that part of the invite you mean, there was a hidden message?
--i'll organize a meeting later to properly go over how this incident report should be written!
in the meantime, do you think you could head out and look for more clues? we can compare notes when you're done - i'm counting on you!
the ones from before weren't defeated either?
otherwise, you won't even catch me in a starskiff.
so, we should leave march behind to take care of the express?
mm, i hear that the astral express has established a collaboration with the garden of recollection for your next destination?
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
the merchant guild's funds are not exactly overflowing right now. we need to work harder.
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
in any case, i do want to see some other civilizations before i go home. it'd be a crime to waste this opportunity on the express.
so that's it this is just going to go on and on forever. we can't do that.
this skill in exploiting the blind spots of others' mindsets is so atypical of them. i'm afraid the ipc and the intelligentsia guild unknowingly became their accomplices.
that way, even if the front line were to collapse the fragmentum monsters wouldn't be able to make it to the other side.
sure is, i've already started placing bets.
correct -- the exterior is similar to the grizzly, but its weapons and armor are more advanced.
aventurine is telling the truth. this "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
herta, think about it. how many surprises has this project given you? and how many disappointments has it given you?
ha, you're a natural-born commander. understood, leave it to me, son.
as such, i am about to make a decision that runs counter to those rules and regulations. oh, uh -- decisions, plural. haha, what a rare pleasure.
that's the cruelty of a stellaron. still, compared with some of the other planets we've visited, at least this one has hope.
at our current strength, it would be incredibly dangerous to use force. svarog's robots don't fear sacrifice, and i don't want to risk underworld lives.
i see has it brought back any guests recently, say in the last day or two? we're currently investigating a missing person case that occurred within the beautiful dream.
so how about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? i'm quite eager to have it back.
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point
no matter the method employed, our bodies will eventually return to their original states.
"what's that dolt gepard up to now? luka, you'd better fight like your life is on the line! if you lose, i'll make sure you wish you were really dead!"
i brought you guys here, and i'm standing with you till the end!
during these hard-earned rest days, people are given the chance to extricate themselves from the stresses of everyday life, allowing a certain tranquility to return to their souls.
i want to see the stellaron. i want to see the place where cocolia sacrificed herself.
understood. however, the general promised that all intel would be shared with us. we have a right to know anything that kafka divulges.
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
and as for hoolay, i'll send my lieutenants jiaoqiu and moze to check on his condition in prison and ready him for transport. if there are no more questions, shall we get this started?
of course, it'd be great if you never had to use any of it, but i hope my analysis is of help to the conductor!
remember what i said earlier? working with the ipc is a way to keep the family in check.
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
if the express ever runs into trouble in its future endeavors, please remember that the luofu will always be a sanctuary for you all.
rappa, are you not done with your ninja tech yet?
that's a bold declaration.
look, an id card: "talent motivation department: shamari" is this the victim's?
if these two incidents were caused by the same person, then the suspicion put on you would decrease provided that this fire-suppression record does exist in the system.
the mood was on fire that day, but the final match was over in just a few swings -- everyone wanted more. so, in the heat of the moment, i just come on -- don't hold that against me, seele.
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
but if you lose, i would kindly ask that you gracefully accept defeat and refrain from causing any more trouble in my arena. are we all in agreement?
that was six? seven years ago? i was patrolling with some comrades in the neighboring town of moltammerville -- we passed an ordinary mechanics shop.
it would've taken us much longer to fight off the shadow without you. serval how are you feeling?
so, a guardian of sorts!
settlement? what a literary turn of phrase. why, there's only one place in this world where the living still reside -- our beloved belobog! the further away you get, the dicier things become.
i was too caught up in security department affairs -- i forgot how important it is to get some good rest.
if you encounter any problems, feel free to talk to me. listening has always been my job.
well, adventures are exhilarating, but rest and recuperation is equally important.
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise
i agreed to grant you an audience, not meet you in combat.
alright, alright, calm down. she'll be able to look after herself.
walk with me. let's forget our problems for a while.
at least give me a proper introduction! genius society number eighty-three of all my outstanding achievements, that's what you want to mention?
i know this is hard, you don't have to be hard-pressed to make a decision. as i have said... the answer is inconsequential.
hmph there's no way back anyway. at least cocolia won't catch us off guard now. so what if it's an ambush!? we're not about to lose now!
the problem with miss tingyun is just as i suspected before. that prank shattered her into notes that are each a part of her.
thank you for the humor. it is good for tense moments like these.
come on -- take it.
"observes the potential of the temporal plane." they say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to time.
general feixiao is my benefactor and patient. a doctor's life belongs to his patient. i cannot leave this world before she's cured.
ah, no i, it's haha, this locked-room murder case is pretty fun. i wanna guess who it was
serval is right this time this was lynx's own choice. we won't be upset with her.
yukong is a survivor of that war. her best friend, caiyi, perished on the battlefield.
but this is not its most intrinsic function.
it seems as if i've become a pawn in someone else's game.
three. just three steps. trust me, it won't take too much of your time!
before we set off, i need to clarify the aim of this journey with you
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
no sweat. this is your first time in belobog -- i just want you to feel some of the warmth the city has to offer.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
both i and the oak family cannot acquiesce to your request.
and that photo wall filled with the express crew's happy memories -- it's obvious that miss march loves keeping records of her life.
well, guess it's time to show these bumpkins something serious.
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
everyone really has their own agenda after all
such a natural state of composure is rare -- even on the xianzhou inspiring
why wouldn't i? you've gotta be self-reliant down here. watch, you might learn something.
if the weather here was as good as inside the city, then we could have camped anywhere.
when the time comes, compare your findings with mine. if both our findings align, or if you can provide me more insights then they will truly be able to grant you mercy and honesty.
he didn't? that doesn't sound like the divine foresight i know.
i might not know all the stories and legends, but i know a legendary sword when i see one.
even a judge knows her! her reputation sure does precede her
haha! us outsiders should not judge the laws of the vidyadhara.
now, get some rest and prepare yourselves for the operation ahead. i look forward to seeing you in action~
you're definitely a unique individual, just like huaiyan said.
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
just pointing out the facts. mister yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than i do.
then tell me about the tour.
it is a state of being relaxed while maintaining a focused mind. the individual may look carefree, but they harbor a constant readiness.
i see. well, when you put it that way looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
according to their programming, aether spirits are supposed to obediently follow a player's commands and faithfully execute their instructions which doesn't seem to be the case right now.
are you waiting for a sign? time is ticking. descend via the elevator -- what you seek is there.
i asked him how to use the express' data bank but somehow we ended up talking about belobog geography.
it's simple! first, you need to register your account at a terminal in this festival service hall. oh, you haven't created one, correct?
okay, okay, i promise this is the last time.
i need to make sure the silvermane guards are always at the ready.
sounds like an unusual condition you've got there. you should stay a while in penacony!
the people answered the call of the architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
oh man miss carmella, why is your dream making me tear up too
i really hope i get the chance to look around the space station.
yes, thank you, all of you. i'll never back down from a fight ever again.
while the nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
i haven't seen him for a while i hope he's grown up a bit since then.
are you serious? that's big news. how come i never heard about it?
but, the balance of power is tilting ever so slightly towards humanity, the crucial factor being the hope you brought about.
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back or maybe i'm just describing myself.
well if you want my opinion, they're a bunch of artless, stubborn fools. but who cares what i think, huh?
indeed. this means that these borisin have a steady supply of the medicine within the luofu.
i do trust miss march seventh's taste. actually, i just tried picking out a few designs with her, but she now seems more conflicted than i am
nice story. but what's it got to do with chasing lady bailu?
though i suppose it wouldn't be no man's land anymore what a conundrum.
not exactly. actually, we--
you're not in the best health.
huh? oh that does seem to be the case.
so you're awake?
there will come a day when the abominations are completely eliminated -- that's a given. but will we live to see that day? i feel more regret than worry at that prospect.
oh, you're here again! so, what's your decision?
hey, seeing as there's nothing on your plate just now, wanna help me fix up this machine? just a bit of manual labor -- you might find it interesting.
i know of no "faint flicker" that could strategize such a fierce battle against one of the reignbow arbiter's generals.
this chapter has come to a conclusion. come, let us close the final back door.
i'm sorry, i cannot linger here. my friends have left -- i must find them.
you mean, the xianzhou yaoqing is also?
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
i heard my sister started asking pela to look after my flowers when i'm away i hope it's not too much trouble for her.
all i need is energy. the form that energy comes in is the same as it is for you.
then let's take care of it together until it can return to the sky.
however, she decided to hold her tongue until now?
hold out a little longer -- i know you can do it.
hmph, looks like your mighty architects weren't as all-knowing as you thought.
hah, that's what i thought! i heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the oak family in one fell swoop.
come aboard the astral express and travel with you for now?
the first one is clearly a result of your own doing but i do admit to consuming the last serving of the express special.
the cloud knights first assault was just a cover. you're using the main army to attract the enemy's attention, while we douse the elixir crucibles and stop the smoke.
does it look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
i don't believe so. phantylia revels in watching a corrupted mind eating away its host from inside out, until the obliteration of both is achieved.
i see. please extend my regards to the ten lords
haven't you confiscated his cornerstone? you can't expect a featherless bird to take flight.
so help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
seriously? it's the first day, and you two are already late? why is everyone on the luofu so laid-back? so disappointing.
i learned a lot from that match against you, mister boothill. actually, i should be thanking you for that.
uh-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. you'd better fill me in.
every time i'm done sorting my album and look out the window, i always want to take another picture even though i've seen the view a thousand times, i still feel happy looking at the stars like this.
you think xipe's will is behind all this?
what a small world
you are now taking the point of view of the companion. she will react to your behavior now.
but the president wants what's best for aurum alley too, and yet we still disagree with him.
even if the world outside the cage isn't beautiful people still want to know what it's like.
your master happened upon a revelation and returned from the mara. she has traveled many worlds and discovered a solution
no wonder wildfire and the silvermane guards were never able to find gears and wisdom
listen, touch, and ponder, and therein lies the sensation. cherish it, because that's what makes us exist. such is the only answer humans can offer when facing the nihility.
i know, silver wolf. just give me another minute.
hello, students. i'm very happy to be hosting the dreamlight anniversary this year.
also, the duties of a merchant guild consultant include planning, negotiation and strategy we're going to be relying on you for more than just delivery routes.
that's alright. take your time to contemplate this moment. once you feel ready, let's step onto the final stage.
ah, no wonder these minions are so active -- there's a big fella hiding behind them!
calm down a moment, you two. i don't think luocha has anything against the book.
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
the engine of creation sadly, i never got the chance to see the robot myself.
everyone has their own unspeakable past, secrets that they don't want to be revealed... and i won't be asking any more questions, such as why the astral express is roaming around the cosmos with a stellaron on board.
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need
this isn't good if what those kids said is true, then the museum thieves have operatives working in the settlement.
since we can't determine if your shipment is safe for the environment, i guess we'll have to wait for its biological activity to expire. let me check the previous cases
go, do what you must. i look forward to the sight of the ipc fleet surrounding penacony. you've achieved what you desired, haven't you?
in any case, mister boothill, it seems you've put your travels on hold after that incident too. are you enjoying your time in penacony?
march, it's me, yunli. are you okay?
well, that's more like it! if only the young displayed a more reasonable attitude, we could have sidestepped that altercation just now.
i hate to admit it, but the "harmony" in this place resonates more broadly than within the sweet dream
however, there are still other things we can do. let's keep going.
i'll lead the way. you two keep an eye on our surroundings.
if you'd be willing to call me "friend," it would be a great honor to have you as such!
grandpa always said that everything can be a sword, and that there are endless possibilities for learning swordplay in this vast world. if you want to defeat your opponent, you'll need your own secret move.
"everwinter hill" what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat?
haha, you haven't let the victory go to your heads! and you're right, according to mister giovanni's plan you've still got a little more to do.
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
someone who survived the treacherous depths, but is unable to take the stage and speak the truth. i'm happy to know she's safe and sound, and still on penacony.
uh sorry sorry, we'll get going.
i looked everywhere and couldn't find him, so i checked the security department's work plan records. this is what i found!
hmm strange. don't worry, i'll have someone check it out.
can you believe it? march seventh has actually become a pretty decent swordmaster in such a short time. now i understand why grandpa always had a grin on his face while training me.
i don't have any other questions. thank you, general.
true but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
yeah, we won't give up, not until the very last moment.
the laws of the alliance cannot be subject to change unfortunately, your next stop will be the yuque.
ugh in the eyes of most people, there's a world of difference between "trivial matters" and a career.
what!? no! no, no, no -- can't you see i'm just short of hands here?
i am, that's why i am watching this scene as a director instead of an actor.
the luofu never fails to reward that which is given.
okay, let's head to the third seal.
don't freak him out. i work as the head of the divination commission most of the time.
i'm not gonna let you off the hook that easy -- there's more to this story. you need to explain what the heck got into you today.
oh, now you're asking the right person! we're talking getting paid to play with pets, remote work across the cosmos, and regular interstellar trips you wouldn't believe it!
now that yanqing has agreed too, it all comes down to miss march giving her nod.
i'm different from the researchers -- i'm not what you'd call a "follower" of madam herta -- but she still lets me work here.
seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker -- she takes decisive action. she'll definitely be able to help you. not to mention you also have bronya now.
this is the toy you ordered. it looks rather unique.
this is something from when i was a child.
many who undertake the far-reaching journey to the xianzhou are weighed down by a heavy heart and exhaustion but your steps are bold and steady - a stride worthy of a nameless.
dullness and confusion are universal ailments. if not for our opposing positions, the professor and i would be able to get along.
how does it feel to be in business with aventurine? i bet you're not used to it.
i never imagined i'd run into living legends here. must be our lucky day, huh, numby?
i didn't think many people liked that one seems the city might have a few nice memories of me after i'm gone.
warp jumping requires a lot of preparation, and it might alert the swarm.
ah, saying such a thing merely indicates that you have not truly grasped the essence of learning.
i'm afraid i haven't had much exposure to technical fields -- perhaps she has a better theoretical understanding than myself.
best not to ponder, you'll be scratching your chin all day.
the luofu's delves are big places besides, some of the troops were deployed to the yaoqing's campaign. the cloud knights were spread thin -- it was impossible to guard everywhere at once.
yep. have you been there before?
i don't know them. trust isn't part of the picture yet. but speaking of trust, i suggest you don't place too much of yours in sampo koski.
but arlan doesn't have any other bosses -- who else would it be? march, he asked to accompany you so he could learn how to manage his stress, right?
the annihilation gang, that band of desperadoes who all disappeared after meeting you what exactly happened to them? well, let me reveal all.
i've always been impressed by you -- i've wanted to spar with you for ages.
count me in. i'm sure miss qingque has something up her sleeve.
it must be difficult for asta. being the lead researcher isn't easy.
perhaps i should do it, or we'll still be here tomorrow.
the same applies when bidding my home farewell, too.
ask, and i shall answer to the best of my ability.
still, don't underestimate them! "we walk in the presence of giants" -- have you heard that saying before? well, wildfire has giants in its midst. you'll see.
after paying the price with blood and tears, the luofu people finally understood that immortality was not a free blessing, but the beginning of a cruel ordeal.
and yet all of you now represent a third choice -- different from both the merchant guild and the ipc.
yes. after all, i know what it's like to worry over a kid's homework and whether their lunch is healthy enough.
ho-ho, well this is new. wildfire can barely take care of the underworld, and now outsiders are looking for assistance from us.
seems the dust has finally settled, no? well done, friend.
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
great, only two more steps to go. let's move.
after some system hours, the words will turn into a common language that everyone can understand.
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
i met an acquaintance of yours several days ago named dan heng. he invited me to board the express should i have the time, and so here i am.
the debt that vache owes to the underworld rests with me. all i can do is help everyone to the best of my ability to the very end.
caiyi, she's your daughter! you'll be able to tell her yourself, do you hear?
yes, we're mounting a resistance as we speak. i must leave now, i hope all goes well for you.
i didn't expect this place to be so treacherous. i'll need to be on my guard going forward.
starting tomorrow, i'm going to be happy. i'll have some tea, read the paper, and explore the universe.
dan heng, guard my back. i'm counting on you.
may i have this page to record and draw?
belobog's history and culture museum was founded six hundred years ago, and was originally built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
you've been traveling for so long. surely you've been to places way bigger than this?
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
the arbor is near, but if we can't complete this ceremony then we won't be able to get close.
my guess is that it's because we had communications with many worlds before the eternal freeze. luka, have you heard of the story of igor haft?
exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
he appealed convincingly to both reason and emotion. it wasn't forced, but the intent was obvious.
lady asta, please, i didn't do any of these trials because of you.
mister reca? do you need our help with something?
march, there is no such thing as completely ready.
last, is the abilities of duke inferno and the secret of spontaneous human combustion.
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
you humor me, elder huaiyan. the healer lady is just a young lady who knows nothing about martial arts. how can i assign her as the ringmaster?
you're surprised to see me? you know, it's thanks to you that i can be here -- you helped jarilo-vi open up to the outside!
an old friend. i'm not sure if jingliu has ever mentioned her to you -- it was many years ago
the eternal banishment decree was like a pardon for me after all, i'm here now, aren't i?
ha, don't worry about me. it's just my mind keeps wandering back to those other "luochas" i mentioned. not the greatest memories.
you wish to uproot the researchers' blind worship of geniuses.
do you still remember when we first arrived in penacony? who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
i believe wilder has already filled you in on aetherium wars, but if you have any questions about the interastral tournament festival, i'll be more than happy to answer them for you!
i feel bad about this
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
most of them came to the space station because they admired madam herta. but now they can't reach her or even their own families. i just hope they can all survive this crisis.
for as long as i can remember, my days have been an endless cycle of studying, etiquette lessons, and training.
ah, got it. so, you're the participant attending the wardance on behalf of the yaoqing, and you were trying to sneak a peek at our training?
heheh, you're quite concerned about that young lady. that's fair -- she was hell-bent on assuring your safety even at the brink of death started to tug a little at my heartstrings, even.
everyone seemed supportive, too. seems like bronya made a pretty good impression on them.
i remember lady asta commissioned some security equipment a while back. maybe she still has some spares...
hah, you guys sure have a lot to say about that broken heater.
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
i see has mister svarog ever witnessed a similar incident anywhere in the network?
go see himeko when you have the time. she said she had something to discuss with you.
don't worry, yukong. feixiao is leading the wolf hunt operation, and you know how capable she is.
uhh if you can, please try not to upset mister svarog
not a problem, i was thinking the same thing! but i'm afraid telling you might not be enough.
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
based on the coordinates, the target should be up ahead.
don't worry. once the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
though both dreamscapes have distinct styles, the architectural designs are quite similar -- works of the same hand, perhaps. hard not to speculate on the connection
i would never foresake the delights of the culinary world in the interests of efficiency. now, it is possible that my joints may need a little lubricant every now and again
actually, i don't think i agree. master diviner, let's reset the sandbox and give it another go, shall we?
but my intuition tells me she won't do anything to harm you. if she's really in trouble, it'd be best to go see her.
please, let us reconvene at the seat of divine foresight.
the exhibits here are pretty ordinary -- i estimate they're probably not worth much. let's keep moving.
the ten-lords commission planned to execute him, but he managed to escape from the shackling prison. he was severely injured -- he forgot nearly everything.
a world fettered by three paths, its destiny hanging in the balance
hmm, i don't know much about dream bubbles, but if you want to figure out what this mansion is i'll do my best!
i came up with the design, but i was never able to build it -- some of the raw materials were either too expensive or too hard to get a hold of. she helped me turn the concept into reality.
you know, i'm serious about this. what if you guys run into something that you can't handle? i'll be your nifty on-call assistant!
that it may be, but they cause no shortage of trouble. perhaps i could glean some wisdom from the xianzhou zhuming
everything hinges on restoring the matrix of prescience, which is why i would like you to help diviner fu complete the setup. i am eternally grateful for your assistance.
these people speak of "legitimacy." they believe that bailu was chosen as heir apparent by the previous high elder, and that unless she were to commit a terrible sin, the preceptors should have no right whatsoever to choose again.
ahh, i see! silent but deadly told me something about meeting up with a friend. you must be them?
sorry, but even a general needs to pay their bills. we don't do credit here. and let's not forget, you'd have been waiting decades for a chance to see the dragon lady if it weren't for me.
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless
left, to the end of the corridor. i will wait there for you.
there are five known members of the stellaron hunters. elio is their leader, but always stays behind the scenes. most of the operations are led by kafka.
of course. i just didn't appreciate how nice it was at the time.
if we want to progress further north, we will need to cross that hell. are you ready?
which is why we sought you out, to help the astral express save the world together.
i'm sure you've gained a lot from this trip, miss acheron. are you willing to share your findings with me?
in the face of the seemingly unstoppable tide of destiny, we always have the freedom to resist she must have fought an extremely tragic but heroic battle against herself.
and you, my dear benefactors, will be my source of courage.
well said, luka. let your determined desire for victory speak through your fists!
looks like everyone can't wait. let's go ahead with that plan, then. i will submit the admission documents to paperfold university. we'll leave once everyone is ready. let's all have some fun.
why did we choose to come to the xianzhou now? how did we know that the incident is related to a stellaron? who leaked their information to us?
svarog is not against wildfire or perhaps i should say: wildfire isn't even of concern to him. that ancient robot witnessed the war
the issue isn't the projector, but the microfilm that goes into it. it's the most crucial piece of this exhibit, and it was stolen.
thinking about it though, the lives of the nameless are so excessively exciting. i heard you guys pulled off a big stunt, cutting down the oak family in one fell swoop.
that's it! the thing shaped like a giant iron ball.
the graffiti is like a two-way data tunnel. you can use it to retrace the trail she leaves behind, and she can monitor your progress by seeing which pieces of graffiti have disappeared.
beautiful! beautiful! truly a captivating contest! it is through you that i realize, to uphold the honor of idrila, i must further hone my skills... what a beautiful lesson indeed!
lucky for you, i just finished editing my stream -- it's all the proof you need
*sigh* ...i don't know why, but it seems like i manage to annoy lady asta fairly regularly.
this is where your story begins. don't disappoint me or the audience now, my dear leading character.
so it's just like the first case, then -- only two pieces of evidence. the rest hidden inside her memories again, right?
my fine fellow, was that really necessary? is crawling around in the snow a crime these days? i mean, c'mon, surely it doesn't warrant a spearing?
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
but naturally, you are here because you fear that helm master yukong would decline to answer.
the sleepless earl was that the name of that teahouse at the port when we first got into town?
ah, the permanence's descendant what a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
sorry huohuo, i didn't think it through. you were never a burden.
do you know what to do with cornered prey? hunt it to the death.
you must be seele? you are a skilled fighter your combat style is nothing like that of the guards.
...well played, friend. you haven't been in penacony long, but you already know how to rope people in to your cause.
that being said, why did you decide to come back into this mess? dealing with heliobi isn't an easy task
indeed. it needs one more spark.
it has been a long time old friend.
y'know we're pretty good at turning a happy reunion into a tear fest. let's call it a day and give them some room.
if i said "best for the universe," would you believe me? hehe best for me, naturally.
well, this is too big for a trinket.
i'm not great at conversation, so it's a good thing we're both warriors -- we don't have to use words to understand each other.
"so, how's museum manager life treating you? just a little reminder -- when it comes to working in museums, i'm quite the dab hand"
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
she became a completely different person when she took on the supreme guardianship. the convictions she once held, her enthusiasm it was like they were drawn out of her by some mysterious force.
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
i agreed to assist master guyun in its escape from the xianzhou. as the person who pulled it from the stone monument, captivated by its beauty, i must not let it down.
i have one last thing to say march seventh.
outsiders perhaps like to abbreviate the xianzhou luofu as just xianzhou, but the luofu is not the xianzhou. the luofu is the luofu, no more, no less.
it's not like you to leave things to luck.
could there be another force influencing the family's shift in philosophy, miss robin?
since the sedition of imbibitor lunae, the once-proud dragon race has been powerless, watching their influence wane. being a native of the luofu, miss lingsha, i believe you understand the implications.
i can see she once walked in the rain, once burned in battle, and once held the cold ashes in her hands -- in a way completely different from mine.
nothing? i thought there was an answer for every single permutation.
haha, let us talk of happier tidings. the friends you made on the express are here. do you wish to see them?
forget it. it's not important. we'd better just follow misha.
no doubt. i figured that out back in the underworld.
understood. keep your weapons close. this will be a fierce fight.
however, the same applies to the order. their plan didn't materialize overnight, and they have the profound collective consciousness of the planet of festivities behind them
since my granddaughter mentioned talking to me tomorrow, i'll be waiting for her. by the way, you watched over her for quite some time. you must be exhausted, aren't you?
i'm here to repair the ambrosial arbor's seal -- this is the duty of the luofu vidyadhara.
i hope you have a good time in pier point as well.
i'm not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that's my take on the matter.
because i blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.
there's nothing else except a handful of seeds.
the paper looks familiar can i open it?
the mechanism whereby this mutation and corrosion spreads is the stellarons.
there are many things that only pela can understand hehe.
simply put, pascal's brain is filled with junk information of unknown origin. this junk, along with hardware that's incompatible with his core, caused him to lose his ability to communicate.
actually i want to know too. but as a guest on the express, it would be impolite to touch anything.
heh, so much for luofu swordmasters.
put your hands behind your back and answer my questions in short sentences.
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
elio can see his own future, and i can also "see" mine. he says that there is only one kind of destiny, but before i reach mine, i want to know what else i can do this is my right.
its formal name is the "mechanism energy hub." it's connected to all the energy lines -- i would've thought it covers the entire restricted zone.
those experiences will nourish your sword skills. it's just like master yunli said, "everything can be a sword, and there are endless possibilities for learning swordplay in the vast world."
"what can one do after one has made history?" i once asked the general this question, but he said he can't answer it because he never wanted to be a general, and that i should try to answer it myself. um
if we can make the businesses more profitable, then maybe we have a chance of paying back the ipc?
i apologize for any offense caused please continue, your honor.
once the news about the prison break spreads, the cloud knights will close all the ports. you may think you've escaped the prison, but you're just trapped in another cage known as the luofu.
don't worry, young sir. your master's safety is our--
birds have wings because they're meant to fly. even if they may crash on the ground one day, they shouldn't be trapped in a cage.
i would save the jokes for later! as the saying goes, with great work comes great rewards. the ten-lords commission will compensate you accordingly.
such is the herta company culture
a souvenir for myself? that's definitely an idea i can get behind.
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products
ah! i've figured it out! i heard a loudmouthed guard say that a group of outsiders had met with cocolia you must be them?
if all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then clockie's counterpart is definitely the watchmaker.
don't be afraid, i've dealt with those robots before. let's go!
you care about her, huh. you must have become close friends.
perhaps the next time we meet, i'll be able to see you in the true sense of the word.
don't stop, don't turn back, don't look down. or up, for that matter.
i'm getting so bored here that i've started practicing mental math to pass the time since you're here, why don't you test me? make it a hard one.
oh? so many surprises today. didn't expect a galaxy ranger and wanted criminal to show up here...
i'm preparing to upgrade inventory and logistics planning. the previously-idle dock is now ready for use, so come see me when you have time.
besides, if there can be reliable observers from the astral express present, discussions will go more smoothly. so, what do you all think?
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
hmph, you know cramming before a fight never works out.
so is that a real thing?
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying
but general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
it's time to go back to stargazer navalia and see madam yukong.
miss acheron's words speak sense. regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. and we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
before i lost my position, i was applying for permission to survey the stellaron directly. it was my research topic, but i'd never even set eyes on it. my research was all based on historical data and lab simulations.
the flame is getting weaker. duke inferno can't maintain it anymore.
next, find a suitable spot and try *walking up* the wall.
same as always, pal. if you still don't get it, just turn around and take a look
mister skott, i'm yanqing, a cloud knight lieutenant. we've met before, and i suggest you stop causing trouble.
without a doubt -- this jade tracer belongs to yanqing. i can't thank you enough.
had the divination commission not intercepted her encrypted transmission, she would have remained undetected for much longer.
pets like that are pretty rare, but some of the folks who have them have formed a small community to share ideas. some are interested in nurturing robots. others force them into battle.
since the future of the stellaron, penacony, and even the entire cosmos is at stake, let's draw a conclusion there, in all fairness.
allow me to explain.
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
the goal of my trailblazing is not the unknown world, but every living being who exists under the stars.
perhaps you haven't met me on the battlefield, but i'm certain you've heard my name. now, i'm asking you a question, so answer me! tell me
it's an ancient tree -- we call it the ambrosial arbor. it was once the xianzhou luofu's prized treasure.
strategically minded with an eye for detail... so impressive.
about the high elder succession -- i have no intention of getting entangled in that.
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
even though it has suffered fragmentum corrosion, this is still part of belobog. it was our home. the guards know this place like the back of their hand.
it is the luofu's honor to have you in attendance at the wardance.
as for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? if the ipc tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!
also, not all of them are bad people everyone just wants to survive.
honestly, it's a very profitable little venture. if only i'd beaten him to it hehe, they'd be calling me sampo "boss-ki" by now
according to that officer, they attacked an ipc ship near the xianzhou luofu. such a brazen attack seems quite unusual to me.
you mentioned invasion by the antimatter legion. soon after their arrival, this planet suffered the eternal freeze. at the same time, the phenomenon known as fragmentum space corrosion began to occur. correct?
yes, just stand there and the computer will read your brainwaves, then automatically generate an immersive simulated experience
go? go where? the luofu is under lockdown -- the cloud knights' operation isn't over yet.
will only make me more suspicious that you and the real serial killer are connected.
as a fleeting emotion, she's no different from a newborn. her boarding this ship was solely down to her inner impulse.
i... have no idea. the legion came at a very suspicious time -- almost right after the security system suddenly failed.
still, i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
ah raw fish from seven hundred years ago and some cute mimic snow slug.
i'm alright, don't worry! everything worked out eventually. let's wait for the rest of them to get back
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
so this is your home?
still looks kinda hungry, though i'm just gonna take them to the dining carriage. let's go, numby!
to float like a single leaf in the fathomless stellar sea some called it "loneliness," but we called it "freedom."
i have seen many merchants in my life, but don't you think there aren't many like him, who are in no hurry to do business?
i've never spoken to the general, but i did meet his retainer once. he asked me if i was a "woman of the sword," so you know what i did? i did a sword-swallowing performance right in front of him!
when exploring opportunities, one such as he, a gambler, will never reject your overtures. gratify his whims, but also keep your defenses up.
"stars hung from its branches" then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
someone once said to me: penacony wasn't like this a long time ago, nor should it be.
people who struggle with decisions are either overthinkers or lack thoughts altogether.
as per our rules, any free-roaming heliobus must be sealed away. i was merely following protocol. besides, it was tail who requested this
-- i've decided to forego my role, and never step foot on the charmony festival's stage again.
representatives of all parties, please be ready to brief the review committee on your business plans.
we're gonna need to get you a front page news story for this one. heck, let's get some billboards!
but here's the thing. if there are birds in this world that can never fly, can we really assert that they belong in the sky?
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
go to a corroded town to collect some useful resources? i'm in.
that's what i've been puzzled about too. i never actually saw how phantylia managed to disguise herself as me.
however, if these borisin can disguise themselves as foxians where do we even begin to search for them?
a single slash of a blade... isn't really accurate. it was actually two blades, just that the second one was faster.
do you remember when you stood alone in front of the swordmaster's stone monument? people admired you because you carried the memories of the hero. you were no longer a sword. you were a memorial.
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
in my imagination, these lifeforms would be a new variety that are born as geniuses. i planned to name them after lambda, member #eight of the genius society
huh? you start work this early?
i am yunli. come, take up your sword. we'll get to know each other once we've sparred.
got it. so from now on, i'll be in charge of this operation.
you're still young, so you need to stay under your sister's wing. but when you grow up, remember to use what you've learned to protect her.
hey, no need to lie, nat wouldn't be upset about what we did.
mm, i'm pretty confident in this dish. unfortunately, i was a bit rushed at the end...
if i'm right it could be the ipc ambassador, aventurine.
thank you, i appreciate it. i wouldn't be able to hold peppy properly if these wounds kept bleeding.
you're younger and more upbeat than i am, a far more appropriate image for belobog. don't forget that the reason we're participating in the wardance is also to promote jarilo-vi to the rest of the cosmos.
but as cunning as she is, the divination commission has managed to find something.
yes... it is a fortress-like financial city, the economic heart of the dreamscape. the pepeshi people of the alfalfa family are there to keep it running, sending blood that is made from money everywhere on penacony.
you said that i couldn't bear to cut out the malignant tumor within the alchemy commission but instead exiled the healer who tried to solve the problem to the xianzhou zhuming
in that case, you ought to realize that a competent scholar knows their position and wouldn't forsake more vital matters for the sake of petty pride.
do not underestimate the enemy. hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. the advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
no, no! i mean, sure, i'm not the most sociable of people, but i love camping with a good friend.
wait, you're not leaving?
opportunities like this don't come around often. just look at the guests on this ship. they're surely holding a wealth of valuable treasures.
if you want to accuse me of being sparkle, you have to provide the evidence. oh, i'm afraid evidence is a little hard to come by so "deduction" will do.
what a beautiful name! i wonder if you have ever heard the holy name of the pure and flawless goddess idrila...
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
it's alright -- we prepared many backups. try again.
i know you're wide awake right now, but i need you to try. see if you can recall the "voice" you heard.
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
how do we stand? is there a way to resolve this situation?
you need money for your family, right? take this and show it to a knowledgeable buyer, and they'll instantly know how valuable it is.
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
don't be, i only just arrived myself.
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
oh, look! the door opened! you guys really aced that first puzzle!
that concludes everything related to the order. what are your reflections on this, my dear guests?
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh
but now, with hoolay's whereabouts unknown, everything is filled with uncertainty.
that's all of them. please wrap them up for me.
miss march maybe we should try something more honorable next time.
such a bustling place. i think i'll take a little walk around.
not having the title of sword champion just means my skill still needs sharpening, but the general said i don't need more skills, just more time *sigh* how exactly am i worse than that sword champion
the material is super soft -- whoever made this had relaxation in mind.
this time we're playing the role of a real detective but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
oh, it's you. you came with me after all.
your plan sounds solid, but unfortunately, solid plans rarely get a chance to be implemented. i believe there are at least two parties who won't accept your approach.
are we heading off? it's not safe to linger here.
i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
lady fu, if i am unable to return, i entrust you with the important task of relaying the full account to the other xianzhou ships.
well, try not to take too long. things could deteriorate at any moment.
after the general hall opened to the public, the silvermane guards and wildfire did a follow-up investigation in the underworld.
don't be too hard on yourself. your leg and dominant hand were injured. it was a wise decision to hide here and avoid a head-on encounter with the legion.
if apologies were enough, there'd be no need for a talent motivation department, would there? i've received a report about your misdeeds -- i may have to include the results in your performance reviews.
hmph, you're about to come face to face with reality.
you've never ever seen a flying sword before?
i didn't expect to meet a fan here. i'm honored. welcome to penacony, a world filled with wonderful dreams.
i'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. and as a silvermane guard, i have a lot that i need to ascertain. nothing more.
this belongs to the family. how can there be anything wrong with it? if you aren't up for it, i'll just do it myself
"independent contestant: iron arm"? why so mysterious
system space all clear today! great weather for flying!
are you bored, welt? i understand but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
after all, your memory of me will soon dissipate like smoke.
manners, manners come on, you won't find another granddaughter as polite and well-behaved as me!
i'm not good at acting all master-like. since grandpa asked me to teach you swordplay, i won't hold back any secrets.
when there's nothing to do, we often sneak out from here and spend a few hours lazing around outside.
rebuilding trust between the two worlds has always been a priority for lady bronya.
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
"a person's inner voices make far too much noise, especially so during safe and quiet moments. ironically, the voices that truly matter often become audible only in moments of pain, discomfort, and peril."
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
enough. the location of the distortion is nearby.
but i digress. if the astral express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine
next, i'll be introducing the history of the museum. everyone, listen carefully, okay?
from the onset of the ambrosial arbor crisis, the xianzhou luofu has experienced numerous disturbances, directly linked to the lord ravager phantylia.
okay i get it. i'll make a trip to qlipoth fort and tell bronya what i really think.
if you put it like that, then do you already have someone in mind? tell me, c'mon.
they may have banished you, but the luofu is still your home.
perhaps, we can think of another way?
i don't do deals where i'm on the losing end. so, my "friends"... don't let me down.
oh? what did i do?
i see. that would explain what velite and i experienced earlier.
madam yukong! after thirty years, we find ourselves fighting side-by-side once more!
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
igor haft is a hero of jarilo-vi, yet we know so little about his life. this information we've discovered can help us know him better
that's fine by me, miss sushang. you can also come play with it anytime you want~
by "salvage," i mean to slowly get close to those memories, and then exert my memokeeper power to retrieve them.
behind my back? do you really think you could've walked into the test and sat in the cockpit if i hadn't given my permission behind the scenes?
why do you think that i just let him go? and why do you think i emptied the theme park stage?
you can use your aether coin to read the data on these chips. they allow your aether spirits to equip various abilities. why not give them a go right now?
i was gauging his reactions just now, did you see? unless we have irrefutable evidence, he won't question cocolia's orders. if you go after him now, our plan's as good as over.
imbibitor lunae do you still remember the battle against shuhu?
hmph, you saw right through me. why else would i be standing here today?
well my friends, are you ready to head out?
with a dedicated coach like you, of course, i'm going to win!
what's up, mister jiaoqiu?
that's a tricky situation alright a lot for anyone to handle, let alone someone as young as lady bronya.
i'm not going to rile him up! don't make this more complicated than it is. i'm just inviting him to have a fair fight with me, like how you'd have in the cage!
oh? i guess you're pretty clever. but before you open the pouch, you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
from that point onward, the moment of slumbernana was fated to be born.
haha, if that's the case, our galactic baseballer can join us.
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living fulfilled lives.
although the bloodhounds mistook me for a stowaway, i'm actually a local. my name is firefly, and i'm from the iris family. i work as a stage performer, although right now i'm just an extra
i heard that jarilo-vi only stepped out of the stellaron's shadow thanks to the direct intervention of the trailblazers. surely, you two aren't?
memory is like the deep blue sea. but if you try to catch two fish with one cast you might not be satisfied with your catch.
straight to the point. i like it.
this is it, just beyond this door. take a deep breath and get ready.
you have all seen the supreme guardian in person. do you think you can act as you please because she didn't recognize your version of events!?
when i got the invitation i was completely caught up in security department affairs -- how to prevent another legion invasion, that kind of thing...
the fact that you can admit this already indicates you have more insight than most.
taking all that into account, did we get lucky, or was aurum alley always destined to pull through?
i do often struggle to judge the boundaries of small talk -- i hope i haven't offended you.
oh wow, the train carriages are so cool. can we put a little stage there?
if only everything were as smooth as when it started
don't worry. diamond has always trusted us. i'll put in a good word for you, and you'll have your pforty-five position back in no time.
upon starting my military career, i made a pledge that the rest of my life would be dedicated to being the xianzhou's spearhead, hunting down the abominations of abundance till the end of my days.
what are you up to, sampo? why do you insist on getting caught up in overworld affairs that have nothing to do with you? if it's a whole lot more attention from wildfire you want, you're going about it the right way.
the last time i saw cocolia, she was an impressive young lady i never thought that after becoming the guardian
and another thing! where does wildfire get off assuming that these fine folks won't come in useful to them, huh? i mean, you never know.
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
well, you did get nerfed after turning into a good guy so, i guess i'm okay, too!
poor guy. he was seriously injured and was all wrapped up in bandages to keep his good looks safe. if that's the case, then he couldn't have made it through the goldhammer residence's facial recognition system.
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off
i've heard that the crew's senior members are extremely skilled. dan heng is already the express' guard, and the conductor the conductor is too cute to ask to train!
i have orders to evacuate civilians. see these two behind me? i need to get them out of here quickly. it's too dangerous.
sword practice requires precise movements. this outfit is tailored to fit perfectly and allows for smooth movements. i even added some small accessories. i put a lot of thought into it.
make sure you deliver the news to the outside world.
pascal, we've got mister svarog to help treat your illness. he'll help you recover.
the truth does not lie. neither do memories.
mmm what's this little device here for? could you please let me know? it looks like a little button.
in other words, we won't be leaving penacony anytime soon.
not before i see the money. i'm sure you understand the rules of such a transaction?
alright, yunli. take this opportunity to clear things up with yanqing.
and i'll help him find the murderer. he can't do it due to his status and position, but i can, and that's "benefit."
exactly right. the suspect is extremely cunning. she encrypted her transmission and timed her communication -- we couldn't pinpoint her exact location.
there might be spare stove parts in the ruin. lemme see
you bet! once we're done here i'd be glad to!
that's not what i think at all. besides, the watchmaker also made a similar choice.
haha, what can i say, i'm a merchant, and information is also a commodity.
i didn't expect my wardance journey would end in this way.
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes" i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
miss seele, i'm still here, you know
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so wanna come with us?
although we now know why he took them, there are still many unanswered questions. for example
stop hanging around here and find something better to do. once i'm done in a few days, call up lil gui and huohuo, and let's grab a meal at aurum alley. it's been ages since we hung out.
"life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
well, you should ask dan shu herself for the answer.
such a pity though as your friend, i respect your choice.
whichever you prefer. he's probably mocking me from inside right now.
i've brought along some little gifts for everyone on the express.
so, you're part of the genius society? if not then what is there to boast about?
gifts must have an element of surprise -- just treat it as a part of life!
correct! i see you're just as keen as ever.
if you can't forgive me right now, then... i--i'll reflect further and... find a way to prove that i'm willing to change.
the cloud knights will soon check our identities. i have somewhere else to be -- i've tarried here too long.
there are no permanent allies or everlasting enemies. so, let's both take what we need from this deal.
i was looking forward to seeing your face when the truth dawned on you.
actually, this is a restricted area, but since you're all guests, i made an exception so you could take a look around.
i apologize, inventory arrangement and logistics planning are currently unavailable.
so pascal used to be a robot guardian of rivet town
i do not have a life outside of research. people always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
next up let's interview those two over there.
i wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
then i'm glad. i shall save you the trouble of hearing what those people may say.
once the spark of suspicion is kindled, it proves hard to extinguish.
cut it out. i'm carrying out my sacred duty.
parts of the surveillance system were destroyed when the legion invaded -- it still hasn't been fully repaired. maybe he took advantage of a blind spot.
perhaps mister yang has heard -- there is a large boat called the "eventide" anchored along the sea of dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
hand on heart, i wouldn't want to see her sitting behind a desk in qlipoth fort and sighing all day either
this sword in my hand naught but a needle compared with the heavenly bodies. how can i use it to cut open a star?
thanks. i'll contact you when the guards have finished their preparations.
mm, i don't blame you for that. a disregard for human life doesn't exactly endear you to other humans
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him right?
hey, what are you trying to say!? you guys wouldn't have even gotten to know wildfire without my help, right?
enough chit-chat -- look! this is the weird stuff that happened yesterday when i was streaming in fyxestroll garden!
time is of the essence. the most important task for the xianzhou luofu is suppressing the stellaron.
very well, i believe it's my turn to speak.
you're late, by four minutes and sixteen seconds. you'd better have solved the mystery of akivili's fall. otherwise, i'd suggest not tangling with the nameless.
this scene would be overly monotonous otherwise.
oh? now you've piqued my curiosity tell me, how did you two become acquainted?
no, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. in the meantime, i'm sending someone i trust to go with you.
you are quite the swordmaster, young man.
i hope you too will be able to make a travelogue of your own and include your experiences. i would love to read it.
so, this guy is the source of it all, right? if we take him out, the fragmentum activity in this area should subside for a while
himeko showed me her masterpiece. i gotta say: soooo cool! it was hard to resist the urge to open it up and see what was inside, but i managed to control myself
remember what i said? you sigonians are better off hiding in the sewers
don't worry, no matter who or what wants to hurt dan heng, we won't let them. those who dare attack members of the astral express should be prepared to suffer the wrath of me and himeko.
thank goodness you take the time to perfect these inventions, master! if not, the sky-faring commission would've become quite redundant by now.
mister oswell? i thought you headed back home with mom. how come?
what do you think, hook? are you willing to buy the geomarrow probe from me?
knowing who i am and still showing such malice, you're not the first, nor will you be the last. this scene played out many times before -- and usually, when faced with my questions, most people retort "why can't i?"
just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the xianzhou artisanship commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to get them to operate according to a certain intention.
ifrit's death was a foregone conclusion, and robin... her misfortune was staring right at her. who will be the next to die?
robin, please guide our friend in getting more comfortable with the new environment.
fine, i guess we can swing by and play with it if it's not too far. what's our destination?
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing
to be honest, i think you could've handled it yourself.
after the tournament officially started, my diet has been pretty much the same -- brown rice, corn, buckwheat, boiled chicken breast, boiled beef shank, poached fish, boiled prawns
all in all, i owe everyone a big thank you. it would've been much harder if wildfire had operated alone.
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
i think he's genuinely here to investigate the starskiffs, as he claimed. in my opinion, the staff members from the sky-faring commission are the most suspicious.
do you know what's become of us down here while you live the easy life? did you even consider the fate of the underworlders?
but forget about competing, i feel like i'm struggling with just normal everyday life! i'm already halfway into the realm of needing help with daily activities
pom-pom is terrifying when they get angry yes, terrifying
in your view, who holds the power to distinguish between genius and mediocrity?
uh, sorry all cloud knights answer to the ten-lords commission. duty calls
this actually confirms a theory that i've always had: it seems like inquisition spirits are a creation of the enigmata.
lingsha told me there's tasty food in aurum alley, let's go there.
listen: remember what you're feeling in this moment. as long as you know in your heart where you're heading, you are guaranteed to see the ending of your story.
if you want a contest, i'll be the referee. the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
it seems like it strange. fragmentum monsters would usually destroy man-made objects.
that's not of foremost concern.
could it be that someone stirred up trouble after i left?
in the past, overworld soldiers on the front line would lose their lives in droves, and yet the fragmentum's advance would remain unaffected.
jarilo-vi -- are robots familiar with that term? anyway, it refers to the planet we're currently standing on. it's about to become the property of the ipc.
i saw your duel with luka -- i gotta admit, i was on the edge of my seat!
by the way, have you seen bodies that might be the yaoqing messengers? one of them is a foxian wearing exquisite clothes, and the other wears a dark cloak, like a fugitive.
at any rate, this is a known occurrence across the dreamscape. tuning could be the way to fix it.
hey now! sampo koski's primary concern is taking care of his friends. these guys scratched my back. how could i live with myself if i didn't scratch theirs?
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
i'm glad for this chance to look back on my past in this way. come now, we should go. this will be a long farewell.
people with big dreams have big determination.
now that was intense! i can't remember the last time i had so much fun.
by the way where's the dining carriage?
i know that your urge to fight is overwhelming but let's use the automaton stealth bomb this time.
don't think you can deceive me with some poetic speech! there is no animal alive that would destroy a world so brutally. you are the foulest poison this cosmos has ever seen.
thank you for your assistance, miss alley. by the way is miss robin doing fine? we are looking forward to her performance.
by the way, aren't they supposed to be taking the sword to the artisanship commission for repairs? why haven't they come out yet any ideas?
still, it doesn't look like they're rolling out the red carpet we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
one more thing, don't forget to seal the heliobi within the evil binding matrix.
oh? so, you're not as stubborn as the rumors suggest.
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
so, i presume you two have heard about the interastral tournament festival? have you come to show off your skills?
why not? "miss sparkle's body" appeared in all three of those skits just then.
you heard it right. the ones responsible for the corruption in the alchemy commission are not just the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but even the divine foresight himself.
is that so? you don't look too tired to me.
in that case, would you mind describing it to me?
that object was pretty important to you, right?
as i said, our plan is not about convincing everyone to choose the right path, but about inspiring them to save themselves. so, when will people actively save themselves?
a swordfight must be fought with sincerity of heart and mind give it your all!
your confidence actually makes me even more worried this isn't like helping a child make a snowball.
looks like there was a fierce battle here not long ago.
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
of course, after all, she was a landau!
need something else? isn't the seat of divine foresight anxious to learn about the prescription?
i absolutely adore them! have you guys met numby yet? aw, where'd they go? they must be off playing somewhere.
please forgive me, arlan.
see? i kept my word, right? wildfire's senior members always deliver what we promise.
the alliance is made up of six great ships, all following lan, the hunt. its mission is to eliminate the aeon of abundance.
about that bow -- i think i know who miss tingyun intended to gift it to.
in the end, oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the underworld.
yeah? you could've gotten me to open it for you!
(this is a surprise that will be revealed later. you have to remember -- in a dream, anything is possible.)
well? you may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
that's the whole point of revisiting a place. when i look at everything here, the memories are so fresh it's as if it all only happened yesterday.
this will help us quickly locate the cartridge in the vast sea of data. we'll start with this data link. now, please prepare yourself for a deep dive with your consciousness
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
there has been an influx of tourists in aurum alley lately. there's even a long line for immortal's delight.
that's what mister svarog said. he said pascal's emotional intelligence was like a virus that infected the entire base network at some point.
ah! i shouldn't be talking about this. pretend i never said anything.
as xiaohan mentioned, the ipc sees the dock as the most valuable asset the alley has to offer, but for us, the local shops are what makes the alley special.
life is fleeting. we hope you'll have the opportunity to return to us on the luofu soon.
hmm. search: bonfire in the depths of the woods. a lone stone sword points to the stars "punklorde mentality"? that is no ordinary curio, my friend.
of course, everyone has heard of the vanquishing general, known to all, and unbeknown to none.
as soon as i have free time, the master diviner immediately appears and gives me mundane jobs to do it looks like i need to work on time management more
it's kinda hard to explain
it might be worth talking to the technology division about incorporating a train into our units.
restrained by time and place, its code of life could only be considered an incomplete attempt. i managed to replicate the moment it was born, however, it would soon disappear and be reduced to particles.
i've heard your true desires, guyun. i can sense that you're tired of being a sword, constantly serving new masters and fighting battles you no longer want to be a part of, right?
hey, dunn! it's been a while. i didn't know you made security captain.
forgive the interruption, but i just spoke with himeko. the situation is more urgent than we imagined.
thank you for explaining matters to me. goodbye~
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague
a guild that doesn't proactively help businesses has no reason to exist.
you're gonna have to step it up, y'know. my record is six days no shut-eye.
thank you for comforting me actually, i did do some mental preparations. it's my first time going out into the world, but i didn't expect it to be so overwhelming that i can't keep my footing.
arlan is in the control room. he's been injured, but not fatally.
creating a paradise remains one of my lifelong ambitions. as i move forward, i realize i must build it brick by brick. therefore, i have a request that i hope you'll consider
cirrus may come across as hot-headed and impulsive, but under the surface they are actually full of guile
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
what you said back there did you really mean it?
do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if i have a sure loss in front of me? no -- the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
it is a pity that i can't help her retrieve her lost memories.
i heard some noises from the room origami bird? that's a friend of mine.
now that these guys have finally shown up, it's a huge weight off my mind. bring it on, you abominations!
the feeling is mutual, lady yukong. we would be honored.
the express has visited many worlds. i'm sure the nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
i saw an intellitron there who was preparing to auction himself. when someone wins a bid, under stipulated periods and rules, he would do the buyer's every bidding, becoming that person's very possession.
i'm not sure, but the heliobi are strange creatures -- even the sharpest sword can't cut them.
well, if it isn't my dear friend! glad to meet you again!
we need to solve it before we run out of time. the guards are right on our heels.
do you enjoy listening to storytellers and watching immersia?
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
countless cloud knights lost their lives or became mara-struck during the crisis. the hall of karma couldn't take them all in, and so they passed away.
considering where we are, it would be surprising if we didn't run into strange enemies here.
don't worry, miss march. it's likely that the warp trotter is just naturally timid.
so, i'm trapped between life and death, existing in a limbo?
mister svarog, i want to help pascal overcome those negative emotions. i want to take on this responsibility.
but you allowed argenti to take you away?
it's phantylia we must hurry.
beautiful, excellent music can really bring a film to life
you should go with them. it can only help with your recovery to hear more about your past.
i also wanted to find a chance to tell her about the history and origin of this sword but not during the ceremony. as you saw, it wasn't a good time.
second question: why do you seek trouble with the astral express?
never mind. i know i sound like i'm defending him, and i don't want to make you angry. at least now we've got the chance to right the wrongs.
looks like we'll be skipping the "exchanging apples" step this time around.
perhaps you will remember someone performed selfish experiments on the space station, but you will no longer remember their identity. perhaps we will meet again someday, but you won't be able to connect me with the recollection.
the express must have encountered huge dangers on its journey through the universe. not only does pom-pom make sure that no harm comes to the crew, they even manage to find time to clean the carriages and take care of the plants.
hah. i seem to recall that over half of the genius society's eighty-odd members had a normal death. wasn't there someone who only lived for a dozen days or so? what was their name
who would be boarding the ship at this time? where are they? i'll go check it out.
an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
i think they're more popular with the older crowd -- i bet gunn would know how to use them. still, if i remember correctly, gunn only listens to audio tapes...
there was never a third person with us, was there?
you're right but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing
prior to her, they say that the last member of the genius society who was willing to showcase their talents was elias salas.
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
i sell things that buyers want to buy -- and they call me a con man! it's outrageous!
miss march is like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped. the wardance is the perfect opportunity to see what heights she can reach.
should we need to stand against the nameless, it would only be myself and the oak family involved. but we haven't reached that point yet, have we?
this guy is mixing up his birds here.
you know how it is -- old habits die hard.
we can't get through here. let's take the way around from the side.
i just want to tell stories from the past: stories about aeons that have fallen.
for certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. but i managed to bring her a garment.
so, as long as the treacherous terrain here makes it harder for them to escape, the ten-lords commission doesn't have any complaints.
the life of imbibitor lunae ended. i stand before you a completely different person.
borisin are hiding in the exalting sanctum. you must deliver this news to the cloud knights.
we predict their next move, and we take them down.
the first thought i have when things don't work out is to run away. starting from today, that's no longer the case.
i finally managed to get some time off work and thought i'd hop on the express for a chat with himeko. i had no idea i'd bump into you...
madam yukong must have heard about miss tingyun
worth focusing on? oh, no problem. i'll leave it to you then.
i never imagined someone would share his way of thinking. honestly, you should see a shrink.
i understand. leave it with us.
as for the two cases apologies, but i don't have much info on them either. all i can do is ask you to keep digging for more details.
there's something i need your help with -- i had to make it up to you somehow.
so, this is the herta space station? i wonder, are visitors permitted onboard?
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
this is not where the crime happened. what i showed to you was a "memory" -- the most basic light cone manifesting tech, authorized by the garden of recollection and owned by the ipc.
um i guess you could slip away and find a safe spot to hide. i'll come back and get you once i've sent her on her way.
did welt learn how to play celestial jade in the end? if he hasn't got the hang of it yet, tell him to come see me and i'll show him the ropes.
miss tingyun, i would like you to continue to serve as a guide for our astral friends.
maybe it's too unrealistic to wish it'd go back to the way it was, but it's good to have a dream, right? hahaha~
i prefer to make friends by sparring -- after all, combat is more sincere than words. that carefree general of the yaoqing is the same as me in that regard.
...even the space station handbook doesn't get updated this frequently.
it's been a smooth ride... almost too smooth for a heavily guarded mansion.
we've made it up till now i could lose an arm and a leg for all i care -- i have to lay eyes on the stellaron.
after dan feng's abdication, they fought against the preceptors and saved bailu's dignity. they demonstrated a true devotion.
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
i have a delivery for your boss -- i need to give it to him in person. if you could let him know i'm here.
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto, once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
in short, spices supreme will release a series of crossover meal deals. customers get aurum alley shopping coupons when they place an order.
it's hard being the high elder of the vidyadhara i hope she remains well in this lifetime.
here are the coordinates. it's up to you how to proceed.
my brother said the restricted zone energy lines were malfunctioning -- told me it was urgent. he doesn't trust those contracted maintenance workers so he got me in for free.
take this man away. this does not involve him.
as a fellow player, i can still give you some good advice -- like how the mechanisms in this victory zone work, for example.
or by making amends for past deeds.
you're on duty, soldier. stay focused!
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
lady bronya, i'm not well-educated, so i don't really know such matters of grandiosity
then kindly forgive our intrusion. please do your best, wonweek.
an inquisition spirit? on the express?
precisely, the matrix of prescience is the divination commission's ultimate weapon. it was originally used to calculate navigation routes and predict future events
i don't know, but i feel a sense of deja vu. what is this place?
you're worried that underworlders might still hold a grudge against the silvermane guards, so you want to show your solidarity with the trailblazers to build some trust. seems like a sound strategy to me.
next up is wise monkey who guides brave monkey your disposition makes you perfect for this role, dan heng.
stealing is always wrong, and pascal needs to learn that.
if you can locate exactly where the stellaron is within the arbor, then the express might be able to help out.
but i'll redeem myself this time! i'll make sure to protect her-- uh, and also keep an eye on her
hey, hey, why the insults all of a sudden? i'm just sharing some medical knowledge here, not persuading you to poison anyone.
every day all i hear is "remember who you are, bronya," "this is against the architects' admonishments, bronya," "ladies shouldn't use such foul language, bronya"
quiet down! we have other guests here! i've prepared this sword to add some excitement to the ceremony, not to have you two squabble. it's not a good look for the alliance.
actually, i didn't need any answers -- he made them all up himself.
as the third act of a film, this can well be considered as a masterful development to the overall plot.
avoid entering someone's past memories lightly, especially hers.
however, everyone in the cosmos knows of the stellaron hunters' reputation. so, why did you place so much trust in them? could it be that some of you have a connection with them?
still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will help you safely reach the floor right below this room.
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
haha, love it, but i bet there's a lot of songs with that name. it sounds like something randy would play -- he's one of my favorite legendary guitarists. may he rest in peace
uh she's not trying to be diplomatic about it, is she?
i dunno i think we should be okay. let's get out of here first and talk about it when we're in the clear.
so mister boothill, i'm familiar with the galaxy rangers and their exploits, as well as with the entities they pursue.
march is in the contestant's lounge right now. i wonder how her preparations are coming along
that's right, you're no longer just a guest! making new friends is what it's all about.
i've got one. bring it down.
why? because i also want the wardance to go smoothly.
are you doing okay after your first jump?
i bet, you were mumbling something about "stellarons" and "wishes" i couldn't make sense of it.
remember, this is a war of words over to you.
this "stellaron" you speak of -- i've never heard of it. but if it's a secret that even we locals don't know about, then one name does come to mind
you two, let's take a walk. i can tell you all about why i'm here on the way.
my brother often hummed a lullaby to help me fall asleep when i was young. that was the first piece of music i learned even without lyrics, it's still the melody i hold dearest.
i have other matters to attend to. goodbye for now.
i'm just a healer, and i'm not familiar with the past. i'd appreciate it if you could enlighten me, general.
(next up i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
the general has experienced many hardships, any one of which would be enough to break the spirit of an ordinary xianzhou citizen but he seems to handle it all with grace. he must have his own way of coping.
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
yes. i think you'll understand the significance once you see it in short, i need you to help us evaluate our current progress.
how am i still one of the nameless? i stand here at the mercy of others without true freedom to speak
huh? sounds like maternity leave knocked the wind out of your sails! feeling rusty?
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
phantylia had established a link between me and herself. your well-timed strike gravely injured her -- thus, her connection to the arbor was severed.
no, not those. i have a much bigger role than those extras.
oh? i just received another message -- lemme see what kind of fun is inside this time!
correct. its final words were: "celebrate this superficial victory, for you will never be able to acknowledge the existence of the overlord!"
it's kind of sad, isn't it? everything changes but somehow remains familiar. just like you, dan heng, i traveled far from home, and now i've returned. seeing the familiar scenery brings back a hint of nostalgia.
we may need to interrogate every one of your crew to eliminate this potential risk?
oh? what do we have here? a nameless, a cloud knight, a judge of the ten-lords commission, and a street performer? quite the group.
but is your shop part of the future that the ipc promised?
however, even though i hold you in high regard, we still have to compete according to the rules of the wardance.
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
here, take it -- the corridor of fading echoes mastery mark -- you've earned it!
of course not! this time we'll go back through the furnace core.
they must've come for madam herta's collection... but as to why, i still...
we were greatly outnumbered by the abominations of abundance. almost a million fighter pilots fought in the bitter battle. those who survived numbered no more than a hundred thousand.
well, the compromise came sooner than expected. why?
gepard, can you lend your dear sister a hand? help me pack my bags~
next is general jing yuan.
that cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. if she detects any change in the underworld, i don't know what she might resort to
as a doctor, i don't accept that -- i'm responsible for their well-being. my attitude towards this "wonder medicine" won't change.
no. i have a heightened sense of hostility and danger, but i don't sense anything on the express.
i've already thought it through, seele. i am madam cocolia's daughter. that will never change.
these vagrants have got some nerve looking for trouble in wildfire terri--
impressive! i see you're both living up to your renowned trailblazer reputations! it would seem you two have a natural talent for gaming.
huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
after all, even the best hacker wouldn't be able to find a specified target in the vast ocean of the simulated universe's data. unless
not so long ago, i was still wondering whether i'd ever see belobog's sky again. now, i'm on a train coasting through the universe
nothing lasts forever. you'll stop feeling sad the moment you set foot on the express.
what a coincidence to run into you here! oh, my! i'm in luck today!
i was only joking, hook. junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. but you must make one promise to me
yes... yes, we will. but not yet. before the hunt, we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
don't worry, you can leave such "boring" events to the grown-ups. i will attend the conference with welt. as for the three of you
it seems like you've met a lot of people who don't tell you the whole story.
captivated? no, i am touched by master guyun's flawless beauty!
these names were once known all over the universe. now, they've all but disappeared, leaving behind only masterless paths.
the revival you envision involves throwing pots of money into building a port while forcing away most local businesses. wouldn't that erase the very identity of the alley?
the reason is simple: in this grandiose and ostentatious dream of the family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
i firmly believe that with the determination of everyone, our world, the world the trailblazers call "jarilo-vi," will no longer be alone among the stars.
every time i hear grandpa and general jing yuan talking, i start to fall asleep. why can't they speak to each other the same way they talk to me? i can never understand conversations between generals
all these borisin are dressed in official attire. besides the cloud knight, there were also two borisin disguised as members of the sky-faring commission and the artisanship commission.
i'm immensely honored by your concern for me mister aventurine -- since you're so selfless and generous, i believe you wouldn't ask for anything in return, would you?
to reach scrivener hall, we must take this elevator and go through the frozen prison.
you didn't finish the game, did you? well, i'm going to have to ask you to finish that game -- i need those game rewards so i can let you two experience something fun.
here's a hint for you -- since you can't convince anyone, why don't you befriend a mute? at least a mute won't be able to refute your arguments, haha.
go ahead if you really want to torture a prop. but a certain gorilla who has just awakened at the border of asdana is probably about to depart.
what makes you so different from her? how would you feel if you worked so hard to create something, only to have your boss wreck it and overwhelm you with unreasonable demands?
i used to go to her sometimes when i had any mechanical problems above ground. but for various reasons, i don't visit her workshop much anymore.
make no haste. since i am now a ninja hero fit to contend with the evil ninja would you let me join you in your crusade?
that was the gaming association -- turns out they're making me stick to the rules.
looks like they're not going to show up here. i'll just head straight to the artisanship commission.
mm it's not something i need to conceal from you.
understood. i hope you both enjoy the festivities.
like helm master yukong, after the war thirty years ago, i've grown weary of fighting.
did mister svarog consider that for me? maybe i shouldn't disappoint him
i'm not trying to scare you -- i'm simply suggesting you ask the craftsmen to see if they can provide an insider like qingque to guide you.
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
ah, seems like i can't escape being an assistant detective fine. it's all fine, no big deal!
it's no small feat. the average person is easily swayed by their environment, after all.
but according to the data recorded in that robot, svarog the architects dug out the truth long ago. the research results were purposely hidden away to ensure that the outside world would never know of them.
uh you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you
i'll send an "invitation" to the preceptors.
which is why, before we continue working together, he has a duty to explain himself.
our intel should have been accurate seems like boss svarog must have let his guard down -- these guys are messing up his turf!
we're jiaoqiu and moze. general feixiao sent us to extradite the borisin criminal hoolay to the yaoqing.
i visited the sky-faring commission once and saw madam yukong staring alone at the leather target for a long time. she didn't fire a single arrow that day, but perhaps she did shoot thousands in her mind.
also i should probably ask do you really think we'll be able to pay back everything owed on the dock?
i'll keep that in mind and try to digest its meaning when i'm back home, haha.
oh, actually, i have some spare chunks of geomarrow
i just hope you realize that wherever that legacy is concerned... covert plans are already underway throughout penacony. everyone's got their own agenda.
yes, i'm happy to meet you too. we've met before in the simulated universe.
no, i haven't found any foxian bodies, only borisin ones.
when i fought dan heng, his spear mastery was almost perfect but he was completely detached from it as an art. maybe for him it's just a means to an end?
we're just having a walk. neither of us could sleep. you can rescind your baseless accusations.
i would never do such a thing. there was an important matter that required my attention.
you should still check the expiration date for things like rubbing alcohol. if it's expired, it won't be effective.
i didn't realize you were such an entrepreneur.
you misunderstand -- i came for a rematch. it's just that you are not a worthy opponent.
and as for you and the young miss guinaifen, rest assured you won't be short-changed. you see? helping the general of the luofu does have its perks. it's time i took my leave. farewell.
i'll pass -- the gloomy shade of a place like that just wouldn't go with my vibe. dreamville is frivolous, vain, and flashy -- and that suits me just fine.
uhh, no idea. but its connection to gallagher is worth digging into. regardless, we have to find him.
by the way, i heard there's another wardance contestant who's good at using an iron arm. if you two are matched as opponents, it will surely be a magnificent dance!
that was a compliment.
right. but i don't think pascal will give us a straightforward answer on this one
knowing the president, i think he's now ready to entrust you with the future of the alley.
for a long time, this hidden force has been pursuing their own goals and undermining the security of the luofu. backing down now will only encourage them to further endanger the peace here.
pascal could you please, uh explain why you were stealing parts?
how did you do it, little peacock? did you strip yourself naked, apologize to him on your knees, and promise that ipc would never harm penacony?
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
i was planning to take miss march and yunli to stargazer navalia to see the skysplitter up close, but we stumbled upon a group of suspicious foxians carrying official identities.
ahh, what a rare moment of rest maybe i should find a spot to stretch my legs a bit, too.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
it appears we are all present. the spiritfarers who were supposed to report to huohuo mentioned they didn't see her today.
leave if you don't want to be a part of this. go tell the other two yourself oh, and take your tech with you. i don't need it.
well there's a unique pattern here -- flamboyant even. and judging by the size, i'd say these were men's shoes.
there are three basic principles for happiness at work - do not be proactive, do not say no, and do not be responsible. you should give it a try~
even after that chilling tragedy, this dream is still running effortlessly.
i get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
trans form? what are you saying?
hmm this lady next to miss march looks oddly familiar.
understood, miss march. i promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
alright, alright, i get it. you won over the big bad director with your superstar aura. you don't have to show off.
very well. now, please close your eyes...
since becoming a judge, huohuo has often thought about resigning. she thinks she might not be cut out for the task.
amazing, right? and i bet you always say something silly like "rules are made to be broken."
just some suggestions at the memory level. if something happens in everybody's memory then that something becomes a fact.
you may think that i popped up out nowhere -- and yes, you can attribute that to a lack of foreshadowing. i wouldn't have approved such a sloppy sequence in usual cases.
which reminds me -- march hasn't cleared it yet either. i'll set it up a little later -- tomorrow afternoon you can be the first one to give it a shot.
hold on, sir we have documents authorized by the family that would aid your investigation. if it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this mister gallagher?
jing yuan you haven't changed at all -- always trying to destroy the plans of others
how about i show you around the orphanage a bit more? unlike you, my memories from when i was little are crystal clear.
if you're only concerned with my next answer, quit while you're ahead. every choice has consequences, and every consequence carries responsibility.
we don't just appear out of nowhere. each of us comes from the world that was there before we were born.
we're here to inspect the conditions of his imprisonment and make preparations for the handover and transportation. i assume you've been briefed, your honor.
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
provisional evaluation would value it at approximately two hundred seventy thousand
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
breaking through this line of defense to create "death" in the dreamscape... not even a memokeeper could do that without the family's permission.
wonderful, it's a deal then. i shall notify yukong that all intel is to be shared with you, and that our best personnel are to aid you in your search.
don't worry. just tell her the truth.
that's true. i hope that becomes a reality one day.
it was a song with a harmonic tune.
i just feel a bit empty now that we've lost the stellaron -- i spent a long time pursuing it, after all
it's my sister. looks like her soul hasn't returned to the hall of karma yet.
thank you, my dear friend. this fluff ball is a prize from a monster -- the ferocious fluff ball.
i have no doubt. but since we're alone here, may i ask you one more thing?
this is the ninja mantra. embellishing words with ninja enchantments is bound to make the play a hundred times more vivid.
no, she had pudding this morning. i made it especially for you.
the alliance is made up of six ships -- the luofu is only one of them.
oh, i remember... my friend! after that, we played an enjoyable game.
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
this data bank is quite interesting.
the starskiff will take shape and enter the skyport. let's go wait for it there, it won't be long.
but it's a good thing, if you ask me, because
that's it~! first you arrive out of the blue, then the general recruits you to the cause -- it's like the stories where imperial heroes bring salvation to the world.
curious? about the heater? it's just a standard geomarrow radiator -- you can find them anywhere in the administrative district.
always distinguish between reality and imagination alright, grey?
...that's not the kind of information someone in my position would have access to.
mm. but what you haven't heard is that it's currently very close to you -- a couple of warp jumps away, in fact.
if one day you're tired and looking for a change in work environment or you want a desk job, just contact me!
fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. to resist the invasion, the architects had no choice but to redeploy the guards to the front line.
looks like "sincerity" isn't in your dictionary.
you're tougher than i thought time to step up my game!
but as things would have it, i ended up busier than ever.
the short story is that a memetic virus has broken loose in paperfold university. it's going around infecting the students' minds as we speak.
running away doesn't solve the problem. it's been ages since you two had those fights, but you still can't let it go you need to walk out of his shadow.
i'd like to ask, how can i get to the sleepless earl?
bring it. the box containing cornerstone is unique, and only ipc senior staff and related members can access it -- but i happen to be among them.
maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
now i'm curious to see what this "fifteen-day crash course" apprentice is really capable of!
outside of teaching and healing, i lean towards keeping my words few and my thoughts deep.
i'd be careful if i were you -- if you damage my goods, you'll have to pay for them.
one day, you'll have the strength to leave your current situation and move on to the next phase in the meantime, i suggest you try and cherish the good rather than apologize for the bad.
ah! yes, yes, -- snowman's palm! ugh, my memory is the worst.
heh, looks like your general hasn't told you to stop hopping around like a sparrow in a fight, huh?
good, i've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the underworld.
what was that all about? you're one hundred% certain we're gonna find those robots for him?
alright, let me tell you more about it as we go.
immediately after her succession, lady bronya set her sights on serval's talents. the supreme guardian wants her to resume her technological research and be a shining light for the revitalization of belobog.
seele has been like this since she was little -- impulsive and eager to be the best. for people who don't know her, they might find her difficult
anyway, i'll take this core back and examine it. now, let's insert pascal's core into the big fella's shell.
unless my injuries are serious, i try my best not to bother natasha. too many people need her help, they shouldn't have to suffer for my carelessness.
to penacony's past, present, future and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
yep, there's people from other delves and travelers like you three who've come from afar.
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia
is that so? sounds like student life wasn't boring after all. look on the bright side -- sometimes the most memorable things are the accidents of our youth.
come on, how did you guys end up in the middle of the snow plains? ufo? let me guess, you took a train, haha. seriously though.
then right from the start, there was no murderer? the evidence is the ring whatever, i'm just spitballing here
this conflict is inevitable it's destiny.
wait, i have an idea! how about we use a little reverse psychology? instead of chasing lady bailu, we get her to come to us!
my alchemists detected some complex ingredients in his remains, which might explain how these borisin were able to disguise themselves as foxians.
don't worry. the oak family was indeed behind seizing the stellaron and resurrecting the fallen aeon during the charmony festival, and you've already defeated them.
of course you may, but you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
this was taken by a member of the master capote fan club less than twenty-four hours ago. in other words, you went to find professor capote today...
"the elite player has already bested last year's champion, and claimed this year's title. hence, this year's event will crown two champions."
well, i'll have an honest conversation with grandpa tomorrow, and i won't take any action against guyun until he gives me his reasons.
perhaps, judging from the outcome this is that person's true intention.
please allow me to offer a sincere compliment, my fair lady. your beauty is as pure as a snow-white iris.
it's a shame that the fall of akivili has obstructed many trailblazing paths.
here, the last two gifts for both of you, and don't lose them. if, by some unfortunate chance, the charmony festival starts against all odds remember to use them during the show.
even to this day, this thrill still courses through me.
the most important skill for sorting out a mess is being tough and ruthless. don't be deceived by her ethereal appearance she has what it takes to put the luofu's alchemy commission back in order.
let's not waste time. no one will notice.
madam yukong, do you remember? perhaps that was just an ordinary flight for you. but for a certain child
their imitation of long-life species has crossed the line.
i must return to my quarters, now -- i merely took advantage of the healer's absence to slip out and relax a little be on your way.
there's a rich scent of curiosity here such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
but her concerns are valid. i also find the sudden obsession with monkeys to be rather unusual.
when people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. sampo's first and second laws of motion.
may you understand the beauty.
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
in the animation, he's hanu's partner and one of the founders of dreamville. does that mean the watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with asdana?
she already went back. as you know, she has some things to settle with the supreme guardian.
mm, dreams can be both good and bad because the outcome is uncertain, dreams still cannot heal everything
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
*sigh* you said you hate it when i call you "bro" in public! well i agree. it'd sound better if i started using your full name. right, broseph?
the moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
well, i did, which is why
hmm but you'd draw too much attention if you started speaking bananese too, dan heng.
conjecture: asta chose to stay silent.
if that were the case, the realm-keeping commission would have arrested him by now -- why look to us for help?
we must be close i wonder who she is?
let's keep searching for the missing girl and the miner.
these are mimic snow slugs. they can change their appearance to match the external environment. they're really cute.
i got arlan to look after peppy because i thought they got along... but was that giving him too much extra pressure?
you're very lucky that fate has decided to let us cross paths. i happen to be equipped with a very sharp blade -- sharp enough to slice through the veil of dreams. i can also carve the harmony's brand off of you...
however, according to the rules, the person receiving the challenge letter has the right to decline the challenge.
it'd be my pleasure! assisting new players in swiftly understanding the gameplay is just another part of the festival!
but this beautiful shock was also a result of fate.
i thought this sword could be an opportunity. i wanted to tell her that her father wasn't all evil, that even the man she resents so much managed to forge a true sword of heroes.
it seems you have a major misunderstanding about this arrangement, miss lingsha. allow me to explain it to you.
elio would always say there's only one type of destiny: the inescapable type. he can see the future, and we likewise are aware of our "predetermined end".
a chance meeting is a gift from fate. why don't i help you to fathom their intent, then?
ah that shadow looks a lot like my hand.
"reverence to the three talons, the path to the great roots" this is it. under the power of the high elder, the arbor's roots have formed into the image of a dragon.
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
yeah, those werewolf monsters are known as "borisin." they are abominations of abundance, and we've been fighting them for a very long time.
there are plenty of chips, but it'd be best to choose carefully. the most straightforward... has to be robin. remember? that masked fool once told me to find a mute as a friend.
besides, i'm the one who should be apologizing -- i've put my own personal reasons ahead of belobog's reconstruction
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
well, t-that makes sense, but how can we trust you to honor the terms?
tiny heaters are no use against a stellaron disaster.
you won't even stand up for your own apprentice? what kind of master are you?
miss asta said that the guest appears to be madam herta's research partner. if he's doing research with her, he must be famous throughout the galaxy...
my eyes might not be as pretty as yours, but there's no problem with my vision
general, diviner fu wants the general's position for herself. everyone knows that.
well, it was somewhat surprising. in that dream, i returned to my homeworld and reunited with my long-lost friends. and for some reason acheron resurfaced in my mind.
we're all here but where's the president?
i believe that she was indeed able to hack into herta's office, but she didn't stay there for very long.
it's been a while, my astral guests.
"understood" that's it? you don't have any thoughts on the matter?
i received bronya's message before the inauguration ceremony. she told me everything that happened north of belobog -- about the stellaron, and cocolia's sacrifice
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
since the cloud knights have already captured a stellaron hunter, why not use him to get to kafka? why rely on us?
a very individualistic answer. you have a style that can hook an audience, just like how you've piqued more of my curiosity.
yes, at least according to mister svarog's calculations
that flame must still be somewhere inside the station. find it, and we'll find a way to bring her back.
i will say, the train feels a little different now...
okay, but watch your step. this place is not like the others.
besides, the madam helm master simply asked me to assist you in navigating around starskiff haven. it's no different to any other diplomatic mission or delegate reception.
yeah ahem, i mean, not too much, actually.
that's all you need to know. just two paragraphs. very effective communication.
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
he was born from an accident, one that you're actually quite familiar with
why don't you just give me back my sword, sincerely apologize, and then go cry your eyes out to your grandpa?
quite the contrary. she might've been the person closest to the eye of the storm.
*sigh* looks like we're gonna to have to resort to unconventional methods. are you gonna come with us willingly, or do i have to ask the guy behind me to carry you in his white death-box?
i'm really sorry about what happened back in the great mine mister svarog doesn't trust any humans besides me, especially everyone from wildfire.
i hope my presence here has not proved a nuisance to you all. here, a few meager gifts as tokens of my appreciation.
put all artillery units on standby. wait for my command to bombard enemy positions and cover our infantry advance.
i used to think there was only one way to become a true swordmaster but general, jingliu, and even myself we all ended up on different paths.
remember, we're talking about different worlds here. however, i can't deny i'm a little worried that what happened to my home world could befall this place too.
that's a good idea. it might be commonplace, but it's still the specialty of penacony. it would make for an ideal gift to bring home.
right! the guide says we should find a flat, dry, sheltered location -- facing the sun at high elevation
i asked him if i could go with him, but he said that my adventure lay elsewhere and told me to stay home and patiently await a certain sound at the door.
i leave the matters of the ghost-hunting squad in your hands. if you have further questions, just ask huohuo.
the monster only seems to be active in the vicinity of the arbor. let's look around and see if we can find anything.
pleasure to meet you, the name's sampo koski.
i was listening to the interastral peace broadcast with mister yang just now, and there was a greatly sobering piece of news.
what? not even a farewell dinner? haha, don't worry, i promise next time the hot pot won't be too spicy!
i can still clearly hear the sound of the waves. that's enough for me.
we'll be fine! for us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
creatures like you don't understand humans.
hunting is not a game, it is a battle of life and death. are you ready for your death, abomination!?
uh, y'know friends, if you don't know the answer, you don't have to pretend you do. no one's gonna laugh at you.
oh, you mean the locked-room murder? i thought you weren't planning on doing that one.
everything alright? you feeling okay?
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
because i'm getting closer to the truth, right?
not all foxians are lucky enough to be born on a xianzhou ship i grew up in one of the worlds where borisin roam, known as the "fallen territories" by the people of the yaoqing.
it all started with her encounter with the astral express, and they haven't been apart since then.
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
i understand. you helped a lot of injured people in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies. you're good people.
greetings, miss robin. i didn't expect to meet you here.
this booklet describes a kind of fire that can phase through dimensions, claiming it "burns through worlds, leaving numerous scions of flame behind".
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection why would they come after me?
huh, no voices? this guy's pretty quiet. miss, let's hurry up, flip open the lid and find the girl
very good. although, there is one thing i want to confirm with you
but i don't see any mech or weapons this place is completely surrounded by mountains -- surely they can't be
well the trailblaze path grants us faint power. it allows us to better adapt to harsh environments.
the tombstone that belongs to me once bore the inscription "glamoth's iron cavalry," then it changed to "stellaron hunter," but one day
pleasure to meet you, miss topaz. i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
that concludes our discussion. we will inform all participants of the result when a decision has been made. thank you all for coming.
she's a big shot from the sky-faring commission who can't rest even after retiring from the front lines. it's hard being a powerful official.
well look who it is! i didn't expect you two to be the first up!
grandpa! give me that cursed sword right now! i'll melt away the remnants of that man's curse once and for all!
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
thanks for the compliment. in fact, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria.
on the previous occasion, an attendant named conna had gone to the side room to verify something before setting the statues in the correct positions.
so the researchers who disappeared were at the forefront of challenging management. isn't that a curious puzzle piece?
madam yukong, you were once a "survivor" in the war too, weren't you?
well, ask away! it just so happens i'm curious about them myself. maybe i can be of some help.
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
the address that the mask gave you is right here. but you never would have thought that when miss sparkle mentioned a game, she was talking about wanton slaughter on the streets of penacony.
as your friend, may i ask how the alliance intends to punish the general of the luofu?
yeah, and even if someone gets their hands on such a precious sword, it'll probably end up in someone else's.
i returned to the luofu so i could surrender myself to the alliance and atone for my sins.
it's that man again, always in the right place at the right time though that does save us the trouble of looking for him.
to be honest, i didn't think it would be so powerful good thing everything went according to plan.
shangshang is my best friend. aside from my street-performing brothers, she's the person i've known the longest on the luofu. i wanted to become sworn sisters with her, but she didn't seem interested.
oh this one? it's a casket, more commonly known as a coffin. it's for containing the remains of the deceased.
why else do you think i'm handing out cheap trinkets all over the streets, fool?
likewise. get some sleep, we'll be heading off again soon.
i recommend you visit everwinter monument first -- it's belobog's most symbolic landmark.
i will be your guide, friends. by order of chief oleg
first, look at those two sky-faring commission staff members. they've been observing us in secret since we arrived here.
hmm i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
did you ever wonder why the aetherium wars gaming association chose mastery marks as a requirement for progression?
you carry yourself with such dignity and grace, but you still have the heart of a child. lady bailu loves these types of accessories. let's go with your suggestion.
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
stay? but herta
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
my body feels strange
it's been thirty years since we last saw each other, right, yukong?
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
hmm, i suppose most passengers don't pay much attention to the plant life around them... never mind~
don't say that. i'm sure you'll be very interested in my remuneration. after all, this remuneration is
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
that's right -- the automatons would be our eyes and ears in space. no matter whether the threats arose on the surface or in outer space, we'd be able to spot them.
if someone's got their head stuck in the sand, or the snow in this case
i heard the researchers say that there are some curios that actively requested to come to the space station.
general, this is an internal affair for the luofu
however, you don't have to feel too burdened. at the very least, the current state of the stellaron in your body is very stable and will not cause distortion to the outside.
all civilians please go to the bridge immediately! the silvermane guards have set up a defensive perimeter -- you'll be safe there!
hey, you're pretty quiet. what's your name? i've got forms to fill out -- can't put your name down as blank.
this is called "tumbledust!" an extract from an exotic flower named "yabruh."
how about it? can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
this is my vow as a knight of beauty.
hey, way to boost morale over there!
oh, that's right, you were possessed by a heliobus once before -- guess it wasn't a pleasant experience, was it?
hey, fancy seeing you here.
nice, you guys are bringing the heat! can you go one better?
gepard brother. surely now you can see the need for pragmatism?
let's press on. we can't activate either of these terminals, so let's look for the energy supply installation itself.
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
remember when we entered the hotel in the dreamscape for the first time, and i procured a few trinkets from your companions? their functions are similar.
meanwhile, there i was, looking out for you from the shadows! do you know how difficult it was to make an entrance? they were watching you the whole time!
for the last time, state your identity and purpose.
is there really no difference between our strategy and the ipc's?
arlan and i decided to switch our assignments. he went with march to investigate a suspicious crystal, and i've taken up his patrol.
sure, we have to attend classes sooner or later anyway. dreamweaving class is at the stage plaza. let's go take a look.
haha, i wanna see the stellaron too, y'know -- it was my research topic for over a decade. you don't get that many decades in life.
the experts say that to certain creatures, the scent these plants release is like a big pot of caramelized honey. most small creatures lose their minds over it.
in the not-too-distant ancient times, people didn't care much about their own lives, let alone the lives of others. the history behind the idea that life is precious, in fact, is very short.
so if you don't mind, i'll go and take a look at the other patients?
yes looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
yeah, go ahead! we'll catch up later.
we've heard the term "jade abacus" a few times now. would you mind explaining what it is, miss qingque?
this isn't going as planned what should we do?
this is the most direct achievement of our revival project. more importantly, it's evidence that the alley has regained its footing. the money will serve as the bidding deposit for aurum alley.
kafka's revelations confirm my suspicions.
sweet dreams are technically safe, but it would be wise to look out for oncoming vehicles.
we gathered today not just to tackle the luofu's predicaments but also to address a matter requiring our collective presence.
an honor! i was just explaining the significance of "beauty" to this foliage.
pascal possesses a quality that other small robots lack. it's kind of similar to the emotions we humans have.
himeko and mister yang still have to participate in social networking. being an adult sure is hard.
no wonder the people of the xianzhou wander the universe, never settling on a planet
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
you've spent long enough living in lies, bronya. this is your chance to break out of the cage.
it's the phase flame, the creation of member #twenty-nine, sserkal. she was an amazing genius. intelligent, kind, and humble.
come on, get some rest already! what's the matter? i'm not going anywhere.
thank you. the cozy furnishings and peaceful atmosphere on the express put me at ease.
i wonder, just who is the buyer interested in the stellaron
miss silver wolf is truly a talented hacker. not only did she calculate everything ahead of time, she has numerous variables and aces still to play.
the landau family is big -- there are always people around at home.
that's one brave little girl you were like that at her age too.
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. i never thought i'd enter the underworld that has been sealed away for so long
while the truth remains a mystery, i'm getting close to it. i assure you that the traitor will soon pay the price.
qlipoth the preservation is known for their indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
haha, that's unlikely. at most, they might lower my rank and reduce my bonus a bit. but don't worry, i work for far more than just a paycheck.
alright, alright. i'll go, but robin, i suggest you seriously consider this
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
back to the master control zone. asta and the other researchers have gathered there.
i've always found it hard to handle complex relationships be it cocolia or my family.
welcome back to the administrative district, trailblazers.
if breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. we've long been aware of a potential solution.
but the memory zone up ahead appears to be severely twisted. be careful, everyone.
he, along with many others like him, "preserved" the desolate city of belobog with their flesh and blood.
no, i don't remember the security being this tight last time it might have something to do with us.
shh, quiet we've got trouble to deal with first.
huh? you don't dream? ever?
it seems you have misunderstood my intentions. allow me to clarify -- my desire is not to resurrect a fallen aeon or become one myself
so arlan did go to see professor capote. this is the evidence.
hmm not bad. sounds like something one of those old bands would play at the beginning of their sets
we're standing on the ceiling right now.
the real "ruan mei's creation" is hidden in the giant incubator below us.
it sounds bizarre, but it could be a clue. i'll jot it down.
it's fine, we'll just light a fire with geomarrow let's go back and have some food.
ah! what a terrible plant! numby, don't eat anything you're not supposed to, okay!?
there's nothing but a jigsaw puzzle here.
this jade abacus is too severely damaged. even with my best efforts, i can only restore a small part of the record.
the situation is critical. we cannot delay any longer!
thirty years ago, i fought in a terrible war. my comrade and i set sail together, but only i returned.
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
that judge from the ten-lords commission? she doesn't seem like a warrior, but that tail of hers has some fight in it.
have you dealt with many masked fools before?
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
i see you're no stranger to the art -- i won't keep you in suspense. my master is none other than general jing yuan of the luofu.
hahaha, don't worry! i promise you, it'll only last till the end of my training. actually, have i been making too many promises today? that's not a good habit
sorry, i'm not quite sure either ipc tech is pretty complex -- there are some principles i'm still trying to wrap my head around.
haha, thank you. make sure you look after me now~
hmph, i don't want people to see me that way i'm doing this for you. otherwise, i wouldn't be using my brother's name.
how about we split off into two groups? there are still some things worth focusing on inside the dreamscape -- i'll investigate those and we can link up again later.
after all this is over, i'm putting my vacation time in with madam herta. i've got it all planned. i'll hop on an airship and give the blue a good look.
the cloud knights were doing their duty. i'm here to ask the general about the stellaron hunters.
i did not envision seeing true stings again.
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
you wish to discuss the one person you've avoided mentioning up to now your master -- jingliu.
it's fine, mister skott. if you really don't want your cargo to be inspected, it doesn't matter.
i'm really looking forward to this match too, miss topaz! this is a great opportunity for us to showcase our belobogian pride to you.
seems quite nice of her, if you ask me
oh, and if you're staying at goethe hotel, please avoid the alley that runs next to it -- the one with silvermane guards stationed there. it started to be affected by corrosion recently, so it's been sealed off.
in terms of martial prowess, the average cloud knight appears to match even the most elite silvermane squads.
just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend -- people of all kinds that carried the will of the aeons.
oh, miss march! don't you remember me? after all the favors i did for you all in belobog
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me
now you know why there are no incomplete ones among the abominations
no harm done. she was my mentor and my superior when i was a member of the cloud knights. however, she left the xianzhou a long time ago
look, there's a noticeable gap in the model. i believe you're right.
the power was a rare inheritance, passed down only to those who could successfully complete numerous rites and challenges. for the inheritor, it was hard to say whether it was a blessing or a curse.
perfect, miss seele! we were just on our way to pay chief oleg a visit ourselves. room for a few more?
i huh. y'know, the more i think about it, the more it seems deliberate.
so, it really is a baseball bat.
how did you two get here? this dreamscape isn't supposed to be open to the public i wonder if it has something to do with sleepie?
there should be a dedicated evacuation team waiting for us. you can go with them.
alright, i'll help you out -- the first and last time the landau siblings will work together!
haha, the little babies from the luofu just don't have the resilience that us kids from the zhuming have!
"little one"? this little one is about to teach you a big lesson.
i--it's not that i don't trust you it's just
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
dan heng, could you please find the incense burner? the incense smells wrong.
i'm always trying to convince mister svarog. please give me more time
but i preferred the character design of the deputy sheriff. can it come back?
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear
i can't shirk my responsibilities. i'll do it.
stephen is a kind-hearted boy, always making one feel compelled to look out for him.
i'm glad. the answer itself doesn't matter. what matters is that you've made a decision.
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek do you get it?
thankfully, as a registered merchant on the xianzhou, i get a discount on all my expenses. in that regard, it makes sense for me to stay a little longer, haha.
stellarly brutal! you've attained the skills of a semi-emanator when it comes to reciting the ninja mantra!
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
er just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it?
i don't think trespassing on forbidden areas is the way to be a guest, mister yang, and
i'm sushang of the cloud knights. i think you already know the little girl with horns on her head. and this is
he's a very capable sergeant -- upright, plainspoken -- a model silvermane guard.
before we departed, the conductor asked us to inquire about the three nameless in penacony. we've already collect intel about razalina and tiernan, so the only one left is legwork.
plus, this is the family's turf. teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
don't you guys have anything better to do!? what did we do this time?
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
maybe she was just in awe of the director's aura?
that's why i told them we were here for urgent maintenance! the front line equipment needs servicing just as much as the rest.
it's finally time for the express tour what should we see next? do we just follow the express tour route?
the gallery of thoughts -- that's how the hotel staff referred to it.
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
i'm wondering if these dreams aren't just random, if there is some meaning behind them maybe you're having them because
maybe they're also waiting for the express to arrive. you guys really carry a lot of weight on your shoulders, don't you?
right on time -- let's start the patrol.
the cycranes weren't able to get a clear look at the two people in dark clothing let's ask yinshu, maybe she saw something.
the masked fools so this really was their doing.
why would someone from such a wealthy family do something like this for money it's unbelievable! we have to find a way to stop this before they sell the film!
she's a flower-growing drummer and a great report writer. name a more reliable girl. i'll wait.
"when one is immersed in academic research, skepticism comes far more naturally than belief."
if it were the former, it would hardly befit my stature to stoop to the role of a mere messenger.
oh, nothing important -- just checking in on you. i told you jarilo-vi would be a high-risk low-reward case. why'd you even bother?
march, earlier in qlipoth fort--
yes, the little fella is alive and well again. it's just that some parts aren't completely back to normal yet.
hmm, ordinary means may prove futile when it comes to this individual. but the divination commission has ways of
this tie is a piece of evidence, right?
but why would the vidyadhara collude with the borisin and aid in hoolay's escape?
ha, i knew that you'd get yourselves into trouble eventually, so i got oleg to send relief in advance. pretty sensible, right?
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
i'll definitely come by more often
have you made up your mind, firefly?
i can't stay away from books and bathtubs, especially the former. when one's head is stuffed with filth, one's body is no cleaner.
if you can defeat the ringmaster selected by the xianzhou, you'll not only win rewards and prizes but also be making a name for yourself.
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something and that'd just be too sad.
seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist... humans traverse the path of fate.
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
pom-pom is like the spirit of the astral express. whenever anyone on the express needs help, they will appear immediately. it would be ill-advised to underestimate them.
are you repairing this installation, clara? hit a snag?
there does appear to be an element of her talking to herself.
it is not my intention to interfere with the merchant guild's affairs, but as an old friend i would like to remind you that aurum alley only exists in the present, not in the past.
huh? this paint job and these custom parts. and the way the parts are attached it's all quite strange.
i dislike people who are frivolous. it makes me uncomfortable to even emulate them. if i fail, i will still uphold my principles, such as decorum and stateliness.
sightseeing on the express... where should i begin? it's weird that when i finally have the chance to take a break, i don't know how.
i have asked fu xuan to open a shortcut to the divination commission for you.
lil' geppie so grown up now looking down on his civilian sister
according to tradition, from then on, successive high elders were obliged to return to the dragonvista rain hall. they would guide the tides of the ancient sea to guard and strengthen the arbor's seal.
so, my final farewell will be like that of miss tingyun: i will perform a tuning on myself and return to my complete form.
great, let's head back and fix the cart.
are the corrupted parts recoverable? can we use the same methods again?
our identities are like masks. when we switch between them, we change the way the world perceives us.
don't worry, i've trained myself to remember everything i hear.
yes that seems logically sound.
is there someone here in rivet town doing this? or could pascal have collected the pages and put them together?
i've been thinking about making a brand-new mask based on some trait. you know, switch it up a little. any recommendations?
arlan... i'm sorry. i never knew i was giving you so much pressure...
bronya? are you okay?
exactly! looks like you've got the picture. you've probably woken up from a dream one time, and wished you could just go back to dreaming it, right?
in there lurks a secret called "device ix"... one day, i'll reach it.
there's an old saying among the borisin: "in the forest, the hunter may easily become the hunted." while we may call ourselves the hunters now, chasing them blindly will only make us become the prey.
well, there can't be two suns in the sky. i'll step up and take down the other sun if necessary.
we don't want you to yield through force of arms. that wouldn't be a victory for us.
sounds amazing. it's a shame i'm too busy to attend but even if i could, i'd probably just scare people off with my current appearance.
let's just stop wasting time. just treat us to some milk tea, and then we can start our real swordplay training, okay?
don't worry, just follow me. we need to find a mechanic called cassidy first -- i've hit him up before. this way!
in your eyes, am i just like the tingyun you remember?
apologize for what? you know, you and me have a lot in common. i'm almost a grown-up now, but i still miss my childhood days and running about barefoot.
hahaha, it's embarrassing to admit, but i did face off against that player unfortunately, i didn't quite measure up.
history may not remember the names of the dead, but the stars will attest to their journeys.
no way. as long as lynxy can protect herself, i'll be supportive in all her ventures!
and then the dream started to twirl and fade away. then, i woke up.
allow me to eliminate these obstacles, dragon lady stand back, the chill of my sword freezes everything in its path.
it's rare for all passengers to leave the express together during a trailblazing expedition, but for penacony it seems most appropriate.
miss firefly, i admire your eagerness, but please be patient. allow me to use my dream as a demonstration.
but miss march is a guest invited by general jing yuan, grandpa! how can an outsider represent the luofu in the ring? it will make the xianzhou luofu a laughingstock.
your words alone will not suffice. ninja initiate merchant, is this truly your intention?
we were interrupted halfway through our battle. as a warrior, articulation has never been my forte, yet i still needed to impart the remaining half to you.
they're the ones who accept ena's dream and indulge in their happy illusions...
i fear she may well have had the whole thing planned out before hacking the space station. the graffiti and the back door were all in aid of honing in on just the right moment.
oh? now that's interesting.
if she was there too then i understand. she wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? clara's always been a kind-hearted girl
that healer with the odd name and peculiar temperament what was his name again? was it pichu? or kaqiu?
thank you for assisting the xianzhou in this small matter. take this person away -- i will pretend i didn't see anything this time.
possibly. they always think ahead.
if we can use his toxin to create medicine and save an innocent life, it might help balance out some of the sins he has committed.
another dreamweaver probably left this behind. it's a habit for this profession. they hope to use these blessings as a foundation for the dreamscape.
all right, everyone. let's make a decision.
fortunately, my sister is using an ingenium body. as long as she returns to the coffin and is tended to by the spiritfarers, her life is not in jeopardy. i still worry about her, though.
(we're trying to uncover what luocha did during those two hours. but even if he repeated this route twenty times, it wouldn't have taken him that long.)
no wonder they like to use analogies such as "pawns" and "chess" to describe people. one momentary lapse of concentration, and suddenly we find ourselves backed into a corner.
unfortunately, your guess is correct.
and pulling the strings from behind the curtain is akin to laying down the gauntlet to a genius.
i've decided to participate in the popularity revival repechage and return to the wardance's stage!
grandpa, i melted down the prize for the wardance. how are you going to explain this to the luofu?
those imprisoned in their dreams are awakening for freedom.
amazing, absolutely amazing! even the long-lived might not witness something like this in their lifetime! i'm so lucky!
are you done ordering? then i'll pay up.
mm here you are. i hope the medicine is of help to you
she went to negotiate with the family as a representative of the crew. she'll contact us once her arrangements are ready.
family huh, weird.
please, take them. they're not exactly valuable, but they have their uses.
this is just the worst-case scenario. but think about it: if the mastermind behind all this is nearby, why would he let us look around freely? unless
its language module must have malfunctioned can you take us to clara?
guyun is indeed one of the cursed swords forged by hanguang.
people join wildfire for themselves, for the newborn next door without a mother, for the elderly with no home to return to.
over the years, the destruction's minions have wreaked havoc on countless worlds, and the alliance has been keeping an eye on them. but no one expected them to join hands with the remnants of the abundance.
i hope nothing terrible has fallen upon penacony while i was in captivity the last few days.
there are no more fitting opponents for me on the luofu, but out there among the stars there may be someone yet.
it's almost as if you joining the crew has given everyone an extra boost of energy...
you seek to crush human nature underfoot while masquerading as an as an arbiter and a god! i cannot let you!
i've invited some guests from the express.
i also know that a person will only be able to truly face themselves once they've decided to say goodbye to their past the same way you're doing right here, right now
i think we need a little private time. see you soon.
miekka kivessa. it's a fitting name for a sword with such a legendary past.
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
hey, don't lose heart, i'm rooting for you all the way!
stay calm, diviner fu, the matrix of prescience does not lie. the logic you have laid out concerning kafka makes sense -- it has helped me to fill in another piece of the puzzle.
i believe that the miracles inside the simulated universe have the right to grow and develop organically. the will of others shouldn't be imposed upon it, just like in the actual universe.
alright, you'll be safe here. my workshop has pretty good soundproofing, and barely anyone comes in.
i'll keep that in mind, thanks.
i wonder the ebon deer seems to heal itself instantly, but perhaps it's drawing that power from elsewhere
ha! look at this. after over ten years, the teeth marks are still here.
however, she lacks strength, and her strikes were a bit unfocused but don't worry, that's totally normal for beginners. once she starts practicing zhuming swordplay, she'll make heaps of progress.
i was never much of a fighter, and i'm not one for risking my life either. getting diting into your hands is already beyond the realm of my job description.
should be all clear now. let's poke around.
i owe you two an apology -- my speculations have gotten us into a delicate situation i'll treat you to some xianzhou delicacies later.
the aurora should start soon. before that let's just chat.
there are some sword fragments housed here on the space station, but i can't find them in the pictographic index... they must be pretty special.
the outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. the children of belobog have made their decision. they have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.
me? i had no idea he might escape! unlike you, my gaze never travels beyond the horizon. i take full responsibility -- the cloud knights failed in their duty.
if you were just wandering around, or if you agreed to be sealed away in an experiment pod, that would be fine.
enough talk, you're coming with me. chief oleg wants to see you, and he's got more than a few questions.
if miss himeko is interested, let's draw back the veil and speak candidly. i've always firmly believed that people can understand one another through peaceful means.
pom-pom is of the opinion that we should leave as soon as possible to avoid potential resurgences of the anomalies we experienced earlier. himeko and i agree.
you guys you're not cloud knights acting as borisin, are you?
no, not at all. we use it for surgeries in the alchemy commission, so what kind of side effects could it possibly have? it's just
i can't even tell if it's ingenium or biological in nature.
i mean, we needed an excuse for your behavior anyway surely insanity counts?
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
we don't have any convenient pills like that, but if you just need a temporary boost for the duel, we might be able to figure something out.
hehe, after helping me shoot such an exciting film, i'm here to hand you your remuneration.
right this moment, you and i have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other's minds. this is the land of dreams's inaugural welcome for us.
huh, quite a spectacle. the family really knows how to make things look impressive.
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
with the help of bronya, serval, and gepard, we're one step closer to rebuilding a united belobog.
say, caiyi i really didn't think you'd come back do you really like flying starskiffs that much?
and yet -- you don't sound any different. your breaths are not prolonged, and your presence doesn't feel like it's been altered in any way
something feels off a grand mansion like this and not a butler or servant in sight could it be due to the disruption caused by the emergency?
yo, ninja ruri! yo, silvergun shura!
yeah, the conductor gave me some ideas on how to improve it. it'll probably taste worse, but it'll be more nutritious.
are you seriously trying to bribe me right in front of everyone? if i show you any favoritism, the disciplinary officers will come down on me!
since "pom-pom" checked in three days ago, we can probably find him in the dream. we'll ask him more about it then.
"ultimately auspicious" wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
well, being a doctor myself, i don't think my knowledge of my own body is inferior to the dragon lady's.
memokeeper did you think you could just leave?
all of these sudden deaths and unfulfilled wishes remind us that long-life species still live out insignificant and limited lives.
this door is open -- looks like we'll have to investigate ourselves. let's proceed with caution.
mister svarog helped to format pascal and integrate him into the base network, but after that
this thing can save lives or take them. it's more powerful than the swords in your hands.
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
my name is argenti, i belong to the knights of beauty. may this rose convey my heartfelt salutations.
still, don't underestimate her ability to drive people crazy if at some point your crew can't take it anymore, just send her back.
so, do you want to go out and see the ring?
wait, hold up, where are you going? don't leave!
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
that thought has filled me with sorrow, as if a piece of my life had been stolen away, and i had no part in it.
this weapon may be young, but he's already very mature. he likes to keep up with the all the latest news.
the astral express is the seed. it feels warm -- like a home to me. i am certain this is thanks to the strong friendship you have with one another.
apyra? that heliobus's name is apyra?
for curiosity's sake. affirmation: i made the same decision as you. to accompany and observe.
you've been eager to discover for yourself what it is to be a general, have you not?
what's up, nervous?
arlan isn't here right now, so we need to step up the space station's security. spare no effort and stay focused.
general allow me to demonstrate my swordsmanship. i hereby challenge you
to him, the lives of ordinary people are just meat, ready to be devoured at any moment
truly, i'm not just being polite with you
let's assign the actors to their roles then. the leading role of brave monkey shall be
wisdom has always had more than one face. contemplation is a hallmark of intelligence, but so are quick thinking and intuition.
if not for our paths, perhaps you and i wouldn't be in opposition.
after weighing things up in my head, it made the most sense for only me to stay put.
one: paths with overlapping concepts will eventually collide, and the broader path will engulf the narrower one. that's how ena the order was assimilated by xipe the harmony.
ahaa~ you just wanna spend as much time as possible with me before i go, right?
of course, i don't know the whole story behind why the architects ordered the lockdown. who knows, thanks to you, they might finally be about to lift it something that wildfire's wanted to achieve for a long time now.
no can do, miss qingni -- we're not abandoning you.
you can go and have a look around?
i'm sorry for what happened... i was too focused on that girl, and got sloppy...
the knights tend to operate in solitude, spreading the grace of the goddess far and wide across the universe. nevertheless, we follow the same code of chivalry.
shouldn't you give my mask back to me now?
elio can help me, if i follow his instructions.
i wouldn't use those exact words, but that is more or less what we want to achieve.
they're one and the same, aren't they?
don't be too harsh, yukong. if this gets out, the whole galaxy will think the alliance has forgotten how to treat our guests.
my past enemies are either dead or captured, and my past friends are scattered to the winds. now that i think about it, i am indeed an old man
when i joined the flamewheel forge for training, i made a vow to hunt down all those cursed swords. so far, i've found three hundred twelve of them, and guyun will be my three hundred and thirteenth.
then please, master diviner, witness my destiny.
this is no ordinary salon. the only guests allowed to enter are the pepeshi people -- or those with vip cards.
by way of apology for shutting down the simulated universe, i will use my abilities in the universe to provide you with what assistance i can.
since you followed us all the way here, you probably know why we're out camping today
that was based on my personal experience.
no, we shouldn't do what they expect us to. they've been manipulating us from fyxestroll garden all along. we need to find out what they really want before we go any further.
of course i want to live on, but what fate owes me, i want it paid back, not passed on. no one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.
fireflies and butterflies often fly to me, but spiders and cockroaches come too that's why i prefer cold places. but when the temperature drops, i also don't want to move. what a dilemma
after the silvermane guards withdrew, and in order to keep the peace, the residents of the underworld spontaneously organized their own militia -- thereby taking over the guards' duties.
less than promising, or to use a different phrase -- we're in deep trouble.
honored guest, could you come out for a second?
ha, it's you three! come on in! i was just talking to clara about you.
hi, astral expressers well, you caught me.
however, we have our differences when it comes down to our long-term vision for the future. these differences will often manifest into bias, and bias will get in the way of the formulation of knowledge.
of course. what, you thought the family acted simply out of their own good will?
watch your step -- wouldn't want to find ourselves in another ditch now, would we?
the data bank is very interesting. i love the entry for the mourning actors -- it's so vivid and full of details.
then about a year after i took him in, luka lost one of his arms while rescuing townsfolk from the fragmentum in moltammerville.
you flatter me. this is a sky-faring commission affair, yet the two of you had to put yourselves in harm's way. i am ashamed.
the general sent for craftsmen, and they concluded that the sound came from the shipyard facilities in stargazer navalia.
don't worry. with march around, you are guaranteed an eventful expedition.
luka, prepare yourself.
there you are! come on, let's go to the ceremony together!
i heard you got caught by the family? i gave you a clear clue "befriend a mute." simple and straightforward, you know?
i have added the memory from earlier into this. if ninja gama does not lie, this will become the blade to slay those fiendlings.
oh, you're right! you've got a good eye, seele! whoever did it must've been in a hurry.
i apologize. i'm four minutes and thirteen seconds earlier than the appointed time. i hope it's not a bother.
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want.
the situation is under control for now. the damage to our security system was minor. the intruder only managed to alter a small amount of data, so it was easy to fix.
all this must have seemed like a silly performance to someone newly reborn but i am unable to prevent my old friends from taking sides against one another.
but as you can see, sir, no innocent bystanders were affected in this incident.
the family cannot allow guests to enter a dream while bearing burdens.
until today! the sweet smell on the express has awakened my memories, so
are you saying that he's a part of you? that's quite surprising, given that you two looked nothing alike.
this grand festival is drawing to its close. this is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in penacony.
that's just the nature of the foxians. it's widely known that mystery is the key to our allure.
you know the vidyadhara hatching rebirth cycle, general. the waters of the ancient sea have cleansed dan feng of his past sin. the person that once stood here alongside you is no more.
hmm, i've been on the express for a while but i still don't have any new songwriting inspiration. how strange
you're awake, lazy bug. looks like you had a nice dream.
although we've been through so much together, i actually know very little about the astral express. i'd like to start visiting more frequently if the opportunity arises.
...doc, i'll need your brainpower again.
the more herta tries, the further she moves away from the universe that she had hoped for. conclusion: the endless iterations of the simulated universe are wearing down her talents, day by day.
think about it -- you helped me fix my machine the first time you came here, and now you're helping me the last time too that's called having a beginning and an end, right?
unfortunately, the remembrance doesn't lie what we just saw is the "reality" that happened -- and it won't fade from our minds just because we wake up.
who is it? shop's closed today, you'll have to come back tomorrow!
the atmosphere in this fortress is pretty different from that in the beautiful dream.
that lively young lady told me some things about you
yes, the mara in you is temporarily suppressed. so long as you avoid over-stimulation and familiar faces, you shouldn't have a problem.
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
there's actually more than one memokeeper who's come to penacony -- she mixed me up with someone else. but no harm, no foul
yanqing, teaching an apprentice is also a way of honing your own skills and gaining insights. you've been an apprentice for years, it's about time you looked at swordplay from another perspective.
hm? and who might this be?
i've got a lot going on right now, but i'll try to make it next time.
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
i know i'm in no position to question your orders, but if i understand correctly, you already have intelligence about the borisin?
later, outworlders got wind of what he was doing and encouraged him to keep forging cursed swords. they came up with all sorts of reasons, from taking back their kingdoms to slaying demons
now, the final question
the clues are all pointing in the same direction now. it would be wise to strike while the iron is hot.
you truly live up to your reputation as the saviors of belobog. such keen insight!
that's not how you use the word "imperial"
so now, i've understood the meaning of my second "death", and i am prepared to face it. if all goes well, my efforts will provide crucial support for you.
wildfire are one of my major clients, though the work is mostly odds and ends still! it's always a pleasure. haha, who am i to complain if the money's right, huh?
sometimes i record my daily experiences in a book that way when i see my sister, i can tell her about them.
thank you for coming. it'll be a first for the express to work alongside the knights of beauty.
ah nothing. just sometimes i'm a bit jealous of serval, you know? she knows everything
going forward on this penacony trip, i'll be counting on all my "trailblazer" friends here. looking forward to a delightful time with you all.
as for our silvermane girl here do you have time? i'd like to talk with you in private.
is she being compelled by previous generations of guardians to make such baffling decisions? who knows but this might make for good songwriting material.
tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me? with a one-on-one duel? or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
blade is wanted by both the ipc and the alliance. i'm afraid i cannot comment on his file.
i'm sorry, brother. i always make you worry when things get serious.
no. you misunderstand. while herta is tied up in meetings, you might find it more convenient to roam the space station.
when perhaps you leave your cozy hometown and head to the unfamiliar luofu, you will find your answer.
mm that does sound a little strange. luka usually doesn't push himself so far
your body has been tampered with by the stellaron hunters. perhaps that left behind some aftereffects.
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
oh wow, we seem to be crossing paths a lot lately where could i have seen you before? can you figure it out?
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder
there's a crosstalk comedy duo in exalting sanctum -- forth and back'n. they're a friendly couple of guys -- they helped me to embellish a lot of my act. in fact, the doggerel portion of the performance was their idea.
i've always lived in the underworld and never ever imagined i just can't believe i can look at my home from this angle
gui, nai, fen! "gui" means fine wood, "nai" means to exist, and "fen" means fragrant -- rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?
talking. do all the talking.
well, it'll take a while to tell.
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
we need a slogan to go with the picture. ugh i wish i'd read more books. any ideas?
see? not so bad having sampo on the team after all, right? chief oleg knew all along that i--
hoolay, from the very moment you stepped into my mind, you had already lost.
erm i'm sorry, i just suddenly felt some strong emotions. let's get back to work on repairing the small robot.
there might be a way to change everything.
gepard said that you wanted to help us reverse the damage that the eternal freeze and fragmentum continue to wreak on our planet but that night, mother summoned me, and ordered me to take a detachment to arrest you.
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
wait a minute, was that gepard's plan all along? use guilt to make me stay!?
did you think this swordplay was just a game of victory and defeat, future sword champion?
mm, we should be going to see wildfire. let's move.
we didn't find anything directly related to the museum thefts, but there was one thing worth noting
and when we were in dreamflux reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the crew had ever talked with clockie.
i, uh i can't comment on that. i was just ordered to rescue the civilians actually, i have no idea either. anyway, you two just need to come with me.
the door is shut tight. looks like we're on our own.
and in your plans, the ipc always wins. even if you lose the bet... to the family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.
thank you so much, both of you. i'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
open it, mister aventurine it's your last chance to defend your honor.
ha, i was protecting you more like -- it's a cloud knight's job to protect others. this area is under martial law, i'm escorting all civilians to safety. follow me.
hmm memokeepers should probably think of a better way to show up.
n--no need, bronya! you're a supreme guardian now. don't let a little thing like this
i wouldn't say you're entirely on your own, hehe when you're ready, let's get going~
reserved? really?
of course. topaz, if you please?
looks like we're off to a good start! moving forward, i'll definitely be trying more things like this from now on.
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
the results of the preliminary analysis are here -- the anomaly stems from a stellaron, as always.
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
my apologies, i couldn't get to you any sooner -- yanqing made sure that i was fully recuperated
but it is in this miniscule distance that paths cross, and countless worlds connect. the universe may not remember every person who leaves a tie along the silver rail, but we will.
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
i don't understand. you appear to be trying to save me, benefactor, but why are you telling me all this?
this settles the immediate concerns on the luofu, but my thoughts linger on the orchestrator behind these events.
your opportunity for revenge is right in front of you.
me? this isn't the time for a leisurely meal and this is way too much for me!
don't you know how many sentry posts the family has built, and how hard it is to get you out of here?
still, according to the cycrane recordings, luocha's final stop before heading towards the open area was your store.
what's that smell? why is there a smoked red herring there?
i... have some unfinished business.
i didn't know there were so many great and mysterious beings in the universe it goes to show just how tiny and fragile we really are.
sorry for keeping you waiting, mister paavo. now, let the sword-gifting ceremony begin.
let's start with those borisin disguised as foxians.
the mural depicts the vidyadhara being guided by their elder, wiser kin after their rebirth.
i suppose pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
little miss pink what's that supposed to mean!?
hmm i wonder if we can find any clues here?
the blizzards here are brutal. if we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, belobog would long since have become a dead city -- both above and below the surface.
a mere glance at their background would indicate they share no commonalities.
the general said there are traitors aboard the ship.
hahaha~ you see? gotcha! hah, seriously though -- sampo will always be happy to assist you.
did you feel the shift? so many elixir seekers arrive on the xianzhou in the hope of obtaining the formula to immortality, but none have succeeded.
what's going on with the student who broke school rules?
nope this terminal is offline, we can't control it from here.
the warhead sent me here to check on the situation.
and then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. you won't be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.
although madam herta and i have our differences in terms of research direction, the simulated universe is our shared pursuit and nothing will change that.
i cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
just play a round with her -- i doubt she'll let go of this chance to boast about it.
that's normal! i can't remember mine sometimes either.
memokeeper let's put aside how you managed to sneak past everyone and board the express for now -- you mentioned a suggestion
all kinds of sights: a lush forest after a cooling rain, green pastures and little foxes
the reason why the marshal didn't leave hoolay on the yaoqing lies in the very mech in front of us.
oti mall. there are bloodhounds stationed along the way, though. it might be better to take a quieter route
the floor is yours for the finer points, mister screwllum. enlighten us, please.
you two are very similar.
well, that just means there's something wrong with your question! questions are like transactions -- if your request isn't clear, you might end up buying the wrong thing.
i found some extra supplies while i was tidying up -- might be a help to you.
by the way, before you go, i have a personal question.
the facilities here seem to be in pretty good shape, not like those of a place that has been abandoned for years.
in the end, i haven't been able to guard anything. how could they have thought i was worthy to be the successor
this space station was just attacked by the antimatter legion. we came to help with the rescue at the request of lead researcher asta.
you were right when you said that as master diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
she sure knows how to boss people around.
careful, there are some strange things on the wall and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe
um i don't think that's how it works
well, just remember this is a very serious ceremony.
so you believe that this universe is free?
garden of recollection is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
i have a gift for you, but i'll need a little time to prepare it i'll contact you once it's ready to collect.
the pictures of these wigs look good, but the names are a bit hard to understand, like this one called "black long straight" and this one called "motherly blue."
*sigh* i mean, you're kinda living up to the first bit right now.
from there, we can say that the difference between an abomination and a xianzhou person is not one of taxonomy, but one of culture.
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
it's okay, i've thought it through if it were up to me, i'd sign the contract.
eh what's next, svarog? is it belobogian against belobogian?
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
mister svarog, i still want to help you check a few other modules turn around a little.
"the person present who shouldn't be" who could that be?
i know that wildfire wants to talk to mister svarog but no matter how many times you talk to him, mister svarog won't change his mind
like a drowning individual in the deep sea, when one's body and mind bear immense pressure, agony, confusion, and despair will follow. i firmly believe that...
madam yukong, the gods use humans as pawns in their cosmic game, sacrificing countless innocent souls have you ever thought about making them pay?
did you get himeko's message? it's time to go. the conductor will nag us again if we put the express behind schedule.
you're from the merchant guild?
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express, just to listen to music?
um so, silent but deadly, let me know when you're ready and we can set off.
imagination is the source of all existence. children need only their imagination to understand the express.
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
don't let her appetite for chaos fool you -- i think that kid's going places.
mister president, the way i see it, you shouldn't regard the alley as a souvenir from the past.
miss acheron, i have a suggestion: why not split up and look for a way out, and meet up again when we find something? that would speed things up.
aren't you going to take my name too, miss?
that's settled then. i'll leave nat to you. remember to keep the secret -- for bron-- no, for belobog's sake.
this only represents one outcome
hello, good evening! i'm robin, a singer from the family. no need for formalities, this is just a friendly off-stage chat. can you spare me a moment?
huh? really? i just wanted to say something
i was initially skeptical about the vidyadhara's betrayal of the alliance but after hearing your confession, i realize that there is no point in talking about trust.
it's like belobog in the dead of the night: empty, quiet, but always kind.
long time no see, astral express crew. aventurine has told me a lot about your happenings hmm?
one two three
uh-huh! i let's just leave it here for a while and it'll be alright, right?
while there aren't any people in this mansion... they've set up quite a few memetic guards to patrol this place.
now that's more like it! you had me in a cold sweat with those jokes
the merlin's claw and i couldn't be more different in terms of temperament and how we handle things, but our perspectives on many issues are quite similar it's interesting if you think about it.
they're behind us. if negotiations go well, then dunn will lead them down into the underworld.
thanks for telling me everything. i didn't think things would get so out of hand
while the general could teach me the art of swordplay, he couldn't teach me why i should keep on going. he said the reason must come from within myself. i've been struggling to find that reason.
looks like there's a lot more to this story.
i'll go chat with himeko later and see if she has any advice about modifying my mechanical hand.
given the situation on the luofu, those on the yaoqing are concerned about hoolay's imprisonment. i'm afraid that the routine visit every century is no longer sufficient to ease their concerns.
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
when the stellaron was extracted, even for that brief moment, it corroded the space station and formed a new space -- what we now call the fragmentum.
don't worry, wilder! it's only natural that i introduce the festival to my new friends here. you can go ahead and attend to other matters while i show these two around.
i trust that one day, her present experiences will become unique memories.
there's also the saying: "from misfortune comes bliss."
aaaand she logged out. how hasty of her.
on the contrary, i plan on staying here for a while to see up close what kind of surprises the new branch of the universe has in store for me.
okay why?
given the present circumstances, the cloud knight garrison probably isn't a safe destination, wouldn't you say?
feels like we're not getting many friendly looks, huh.
haha, oh yeah? well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
thank you. i'm sure it'll leave a lasting impression.
do you want to mention the time we smashed a hole through taikiyan stadium, or shall i?
i'll be entering any new information we encounter on future journeys, so drop by anytime to check it out. we also have a shortcut on the terminal device.
are you dealing with attacks like this every day?
i i'm not entirely sure, but let's give it a try.
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way)
but despite all that, i believe in you.
hmm i see. they're likely acting this way due to some sort of data anomaly or discrepancy.
wonderful! remember to bring enough food and drink to refuel on the way. we have a lot of steps to climb!
i knew you'd ask about this. go on.
i'm afraid "evil plans" are still within the realm of speculation at this stage. we have no way of knowing exactly what he did because the cycrane data was lost.
the leader of belobog, elected and appointed by the architects. the supreme guardians have watched over this city for generations, sheltering the people from harm.
we may be on amicable terms, but that doesn't mean they trust us let's act first and talk later.
oh, come on, don't listen to his empty talk.
she wields her sword with ease. i shouldn't underestimate her.
i agree. another unusual thing is that the oak family is supposed to be in charge of organizing the council and managing everything inside and outside the dreamscape. however
thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
in all of belobog, you won't find anyone who speaks more elegantly or acts more like a leader than lady bronya.
(this is part of my dreamscape -- belobog is the setting for this dream.)
can you see the express in boulder town? why does it fly in the sky? who is the conductor?
if i am fortunate enough to emerge victorious, kindly grant me passage to the crown of victory and recognize that...
oh, nothing. it's just you don't see things like this every day.
she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
that's where the joy lies. even the most predictable storylines can have their pleasant surprises.
looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of the hunt.
if it's not too much trouble. also, we're looking for our missing companions: a woman with red hair, accompanied by a girl with pink hair. have you seen them?
in which case, we need to think of a way to convince svarog to communicate with us.
you should also tell them about our glorious victory!
as far as i can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
i accidentally overheard how the express obtains fuel.
"really? but i don't taste... any difference at all between them."
...xipe the harmony. legend has it that they participated in the crusade against the imperator insectorum and devoured ena the order for unknown reasons.
this species can reach tremendous proportions and is big enough to swallow an entire starnought.
i prefer exquisitely composed musical movements, and that won't change. but i must admit, accidents and surprises can also create splendid dramas, and so it is with life.
huh? old oleg isn't here either. where is everyone? hehe, hm
if you're referring to what i think about you joining the astral express you're overthinking it.
anyways, let's take a look at what ingredients we have.
apologies for interrupting you earlier.
(i, uh i try to go with the flow.)
so you know her! well, that makes this easy.
then it's a deal. if you go back on your promise, i'm going to bring my silvermane guards with me and catch you myself! here, take the medal and go back to the town. we already took care of any threat on the way. you'll be safe.
alright, it's getting late. let's talk once we're home.
it's no use, seele. she's made up her mind. i could tell from her expression.
wow, the general recognizes me? i didn't realize i was so famous!
well it's like this: the chief's in the market for specific talent -- an urgent request. so, i'm taking them to see him
so if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. relax, if i need your assistance, i won't hesitate to ask.
about that, you've given me many insights as well. humans are the measure of everything, and no one is the sole savior.
he entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. if that's the case he should have seen everything that happened here
of course! this project has been approved personally by the president of the belobog architecture guild and the minister of culture.
show yourself. your trick won't work on us.
thank you for everything you've done. i'll be waiting here.
remain here -- lead the cloud knights in defense of this passage. we must prevent further incidents.
wow, you answered in a heartbeat!
my sister has likely made an agreement of some sort with them. as for how i'm able to move around freely in penacony, i have wonweek to thank for that.
it is a never-ending cycle of falling... and standing up again. each time i wander closer to death, it gets me closer to the path the beauty once walked.
not really, i've just seen them before, that's all.
so, these three are the ones you mentioned, jing yuan? the heroes who helped you with the ambrosial arbor crisis?
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
just like that, he conquered every opponent and finally stood before me, much like how you faced yanqing. he threw his punches in silence, matching me blow for blow.
the defense of boulder town will need wildfire's expertise. watch out for ambushes and be ready to receive wounded soldiers.
as a representative in this duel, i, argenti, challenge you!
my friend, are you serious? this device is quite rare. are you really willing to sell it to me at such a low price?
...thank you for helping lady asta... and for coming to find me.
true. mister svarog is always there for me.
of course! i wouldn't want to miss out on seeing you and miss hook's acts of heroism, would i?
are you suggesting that there are people trying to understand hoolay's secrets and use them for their own purposes, just like with this mech?
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
"unearth the truth" you mean interrogate kafka with the matrix of prescience?
belobog has a heating system of its own. however, maintaining a steady indoor temperature has always been a challenge, no matter if it's qlipoth fort or the boulder town clinic.
she was there? wait, what... you're kidding... oh my, this just got even more interesting.
and the purpose of the contents of your coffin.
my intuition tells me this is mostly linked to madam cocolia's passing.
i thought they would choose a more formal and low-key location for the conference. i didn't expect them to go with a luxury airship
this old man's words always catch me off guard.
i'm sorry, my lady... i didn't want to bother anyone, so i didn't mention it.
i know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the dreamscape than others. this is also why i have to accompany you.
these mara-struck soldiers don't appear to be escaped prisoners.
when the flames of an ideal are ignited within a person, they leave an indelible mark. that man must have a past worthy of being called "heroic."
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
tsk boy, i knew it was too good to be true!
no, i can't but more importantly, what kind of "foul language" were you using?
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
i i don't know much about warfare, but i don't see why a commander needs to lead the charge. the situation here is totally different from the restricted zone.
--they are not scum!
i must admit, many of your qualities strike a chord with me. there are times when i want to joke around, freely express my thoughts, or openly share my dislike of a person
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
it's, um right! you remember how you neglected all those flowers to death? i piled them all over there during a bit of spring cleaning, and now they smell terrible! so don't go over there!
this is what trailblazing is.
i think it's time to pack up my things and head home with lynx and the others.
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something
and that is precisely why we need you in charge. when it comes to handling clairvoyant stellaron hunters, who better than fu xuan the seer? as for reinforcements, you didn't think i'd be unprepared, did you?
there's no other way. desperate times call for desperate measures.
come on out, wonweek. we've found ourselves an ally.
come now, it's time we set off. let's not stick too close to each other, just in case. a few feet or so between us will do.
he was, but not anymore.
our apologies, mister sunday. nobody came to greet us, so we entered without permission. i hope you can forgive us.
if we have time, i would like to speak with the conductor and listen to their experiences of managing the express.
this mirage echo he must be a cloud knight who fought alongside dan feng all those years ago.
oh, sorry, i'm doing my tour guide thing again. i'm sure someone as well-traveled as yourself has seen much fancier equipment than this.
oh, you mean the young boy? the one who's always by the general? i don't know anything about him
it's easier for you youngsters. for this old guy, the steps of the furnace core are a nightmare on the knees!
that's the information i managed to piece together. bladie refused to tell me the details.
the vagrants say that the parts they worked so hard to obtain have completely vanished. they're worried that there's a thief in the camp
and one of them hasn't returned to me because she ventured too far. until now.
the charmony festival will start soon. there's one thing that... i need to confirm no matter what. a warp jump is the best way to do so.
i guess it shouldn't be a problem. after all, he did get nerfed after turning into a good guy.
yeah, that's the spirit! i wanna see some places with a little more get up and go, y'know? still, those places wouldn't be home.
here, take this. it's nothing expensive, but i'm sure it'll be of help.
the borisins, known for their ferocity among the denizens of abundance, are similar to the foxians of the yaoqing genetically but the foxians are not abominations -- they're xianzhou people.
we can sleep when we're back on the express.
not there. come back.
bighead fiendling, educators impart knowledge, cultivate skills, and clarify doubts, but they must never deny any ninja initiate of their way of the ninja!
i'm afraid this ebon deer was likely birthed by the ambrosial arbor as its guardian -- it shares a close connection with the arbor's roots. most living creatures on the xianzhou don't have abilities like this.
the ten-lords commission has specially entrusted judge huohuo with commanding the ghost-hunting squad, so please make sure to follow her lead in all matters related to the heliobi.
put a watermelon parfait in herta's office and stephen is sure to show up. remember, the pumpkin ones will never attract him -- those are for warding him off.
fine. here, take this. open it when you're on your last legs. you'll thank me.
though an aeon may perish, paths with no masters still linger. in the all-forgiving harmony echoes of bygone dissonance may subtly arise.
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
but before you do, i would make a request of you.
you look pale. or, is that also part of your act?
sure, there were clashes and distrust, but virtually everyone was acting in the best interest of the alley. if that hadn't been the case, the whole thing would have fallen apart.
i'm definitely not the first ipc staff member to board the astral express. i've heard that the ipc and the nameless cooperated frequently when akivili the trailblazer was still around.
just in case, i want someone who will be on my side -- in other words, you.
i have to thank you, mister assistant detective. but the puzzle this time is pretty strange.
okay, so, we aren't going in anymore. but could you help me pick up something i left inside?
this is the other solution -- the alternative choice. i created a new solution.
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
some things must be seen to be believed. the express is so much more interesting than the seat of divine foresight
ah, the one with the long ears always walking around the cars? it's amazing they keep everything on the express so well-organized!
no problem! i won't disappoint you, mister argenti!
jumps are like this: they may feel novel the first few times, but you'll slowly get used to them after a few more.
"sparkle has disguised herself as another character" wouldn't that be you, mister sampo?
may the best swordmaster win.
oh? such elusive emotions i've never encountered memories quite like this before, it's stirred my curiosity.
i asked dan heng where he was off to, and he said he was going to the data bank to look up some material. then he walked straight into the archives.
exactly. i believe the purpose of the journey isn't just about following a path that's always considered "absolutely right"
we protect businesses, the ipc sacrifices them for their own gain.
do you mean the galaxy ranger whom you accused previously?
look, miss sparkle has given us a puzzle where every single answer is correct.
despite being a long-lived species, borisin are actually more like predatory beasts that must feed on raw blood and flesh. i've heard that hoolay was deprived of food and water in the shackling prison
but without a doubt she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. it's like aventurine said just then. it's best to keep your distance from her.
it is my first day at the alchemy commission -- a brawl is definitely not how i imagined celebrating it.
that's a question you need to ask yourself.
a sealed-off port with a stranded passenger? unlikely. not to mention you walking the whole way here without so much as a stumble -- you can see as well as i can.
fiendling pest! what tricks did you pull on ninja initiate merchant?
even if i lose, i'll still make choices to lighten the loss -- just like the master diviner is making choices for her own agenda.
i caught some very familiar memories just now -- she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. there was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger
i have important matters to discuss with your boss. you need to bring him to me now.
fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
you're going alone? that's the ipc's headquarters.
mm-hmm cool, we've got this! don't worry, bro. we promise we'll find your robots!
if there's any other way i can help you, i'll do my best! but this
well, i don't know everything. *sigh* sometimes you've gotta ask around if you wanna know the answer. don't panic let's listen in to what these vagrants are talking about, we might just hit the jackpot.
you can still run, jump, and talk as usual. everything seems normal, but then you'll start doing everything slightly slower than others
this record reflects the change in artistry hardware's turnover and the increase in customers since it partnered with the dock.
there wasn't a gap before. that man must have done it intentionally.
you misunderstand, mister aventurine. punishment is meant for the irreverent, but i have seen your resilient spirit, and thus i offer you the possibility of a new beginning.
this might sound rude, but the only proof of her being a ranger is her peculiar behavior.
if you are referring to the back doors silver wolf left behind, we have cleared out all of them except for the one in the office.
not much time at all! just something i worked on in my free time.
i went through the express' database, and it seems the environment on jarilo-vi has undergone drastic changes in the past few centuries. it was not a frozen planet to begin with
she has a bunch of other things to attend to, so i hope you don't mind talking to this old man instead. i speak on behalf of natasha.
old oti is in agreement, so the issue is settled, i presume. what about the remaining family heads?
the secret of penacony... may be closely related to the trailblaze.
well then that's as good as nothing for now so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one
that's right! i hope you don't hate it.
very well, get going we shall.
it's fair to say that it ranks highly among the known forces in the universe.
yeah, that makes sense general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
if i lose, those people dear to me will be disappointed too. looks like we have to give it our all.
brother and sister landau? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be
hey! are you trying to back out before you even hit the arena? hello, we are both wardance competitors.
exactly. madam yukong would never allow malicious competition. if we hadn't taught skott a lesson, the sky-faring commission would have done so anyway.
i'm glad that you found a new life here in penacony, it's just
profnana primon once called you "the doctor's failed creation."
you never forget times of failure. it's only human nature.
upon reflection, does this also apply to you?
do you two still remember what it was like when you first saw me?
my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
i didn't realize that one as skilled as diviner fu would also be susceptible to the power of the heliobi.
i am only laying out my questions. as for the answers they'll find them themselves.
yes, that's my thinking as well. i'm not entirely certain, but we still have to find him one way or another.
if things play out as i expect, dragon fiendling will let slip her true nature in this class.
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all
tingyun has informed me of the purpose of your visit. receiving guests isn't normally one of my responsibilities
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
don't worry. such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, so once you leave my sight, you'll be able to remember everything again. and also
the music here is different from what we have on penacony, but it's still cool.
it seems like you have other questions.
when people see others' desires get fulfilled, they develop their own desires. it seems like an endless cycle but it does have a goal. in the end, i will get what i desire from this whirlpool.
all three dreams were the same, with cocolia and that other voice
ugh! did anyone hear what i just said?
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact
hmm? so direct. aren't you afraid i might take you seriously?
honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. you just gave me an excuse to bring everything forward.
i'm simply bringing up the doubts about general jing yuan that exist within the alliance. since i'm representing them, perhaps you can just imagine me as one of those old geezers?
...i--i did write this for professor capote.
please excuse me, i have some matters to attend to, so i must depart, but i'm sure we'll meet again soon.
master diviner, you heard our discussion. what do you make of it?
not really but lady bronya insisted on delivering the speech as soon as possible. she wants the people to understand what happened.
don't rush, we still have time. think about it first and ask when you're ready.
sushang's gonna use her head? now we're really done for
i see. your choice may not be correct but a wrong choice can often make a story more exciting.
you're absolutely right. differing views don't necessarily mean one person is right and the other is wrong. however, to keep things moving forward, there's usually only one solution
it must be a kind of echo? some type of residual energy replicated by the fragmentum
it's no bother, we've pretty much wrapped things up already, anyway.
even if not completely similar, this story you just told... it overlaps with my past. and within that abyssal dream...
i know that you're good people. you helped a lot of the injured in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies.
hey, i'm seele. i'm a member of wildfire down here in the underworld. wanna help me forge a future for the people?
question: what have we invested into this project? hundreds of system hours, the resources of an entire planet, and the most advanced technology in the entire universe.
he disguised himself with a superficial facade and gave us a grand performance. a respectable opponent. if there's still a chance for another clash on stage, i look forward to it.
geez, and there i was pouring my heart out now i feel like this kid's lived longer than i have
good question. he's right there, so why don't you ask him yourself?
hmm we still need to ask pascal why he was stealing parts in the first place.
silent but deadly are you sure that nickname isn't annoying you?
oops! i almost gave away trade secrets there, didn't i? that was a close one.
i didn't know so much power could fit into such a small body!
watch and learn -- there's a reason they call me a champion!
sure, it's handy for sharing, but it surely robs the reader of genuine pleasure, does it not?
that's right. but what does this have to do with the stellaron?
so brief... so unexpected. the chance to get to know all of you on the express... to witness the beauty of your emotions... is something i'll never forget.
but dad, i broke his leg on purpose. if i hadn't taken him to the hospital, others would have suspected me
i can't help but think that whether it's mister mikhail, mister tiernan, or madam razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories
and that memory will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. but what about the long-term?
but, how we can get him to do that showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
oh yeah? since you're so familiar with the place, you can lead the way and conduct the interviews!
don't worry about it. i need your help on this.
wait, don't go! take it easy, i just wanted to ask you a question
that's correct. the aether cartridge data is in the next room. our pursuit is coming to an end.
hehe, i i'm afraid i can't. i won't be flying anymore.
we used to be good pals, but now let's just say her brother put in a bad word for me.
he probably is hopefully, we don't bump into him, but if we do, we'll just have to try and talk to him
is that where i came from?
yo, remember, i'll need your help. let's go.
(i think she's enjoying herself)
next we have our goal -- the stellaron.
he will be fine. cloud knights, search for the target!
not a smart way to operate. the luofu is more dangerous than ever -- i can't let you put yourself in harm's way.
friend, let's not beat around the bush here -- the thing is, i want to reach out personally to team up with the astral express.
we would find the stellaron in a non-physical way?
if you are able to capture this stellaron hunter, the xianzhou will be indebted to you.
i have no doubt about general feixiao's capabilities, general huaiyan. i'm more concerned about the wardance.
forgive me for my lack of eloquence!
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
and as the sole sponsor of this event, it's only natural for me to come to the tournament venue and check on its operations.
it's not polite to ask a girl her age, no matter which xianzhou ship you're on.
looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. and he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
so reckless according to the rules of the silvermane guards, any expedition into the fragmentum must have a squad of at least four members, as well as a communications officer.
her parents passed away in the denizens of abundance wars the relatives who took her in aren't close to her, and whenever i treat her, she often confides in me.
sampo koski always knows the wait, what did it say again?
so, in order to sever yaoshi's curse, one must look to the source for a different solution.
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
life would be quite dull if it were just an unending series of wins, wouldn't it?
but if you like, i could give you all a small private show any time.
yeah... we need to find arlan quickly. i need to apologize to him in person!
although i don't think anyone will have any objections.
there's a bunch of crates piled over there. maybe we can find what we're looking for.
conclusion: that is a holographic record that the simulated universe has created. in here, regardless of how large or small, all variables are saved, including outsider traces.
forgive me, my dear friends. if you cannot present irrefutable evidence, i must not yield, lest i dishonor the name of the knights of beauty.
hmm, i guess you're right maybe it isn't such a big deal.
i am writing to you, miss bronya, with the genuine desire to express something important
the sound of those footsteps they must belong to general feixiao. out and about despite the doctor's orders?
their path of happiness should be forged by themselves. while i may not be a nameless, i'm willing to instill courage in all those who need it.
i wonder what stories have been left behind in the memory fragments that we found today?
i was once "bronze melodia," listening to the pleas of those who were suffering, knowing there were no gods who would save people unconditionally. to change anything, you can only rely on yourself.
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream
no, but i do have an aching feeling in my chest.
looks like the jade abacus of allying oath will be the only solution.
it's getting late. you are headed to repair the arbor's seal at scalegorge waterscape, and visit the high elder, no? farewell, for now. i should start taking this business of rest and recuperation a little more seriously.
the distant sound of a train whistle, echoing through the room
a portrait of internal turmoil. you look troubled. do you need help?
patience, my friend. i will reveal the answer to you but that time is not now.
unfortunately, we didn't achieve the outcome we wanted. but moments like this... make me feel like they never even left.
uhh you're even asking diting?
norbert probably didn't believe any of that nonsense -- i think he just wanted to prove himself and add more to his fortune.
come on, camping is about teamwork! let me have a try.
but like i mentioned earlier, we're in a bit of a bind -- we could really use a helping hand.
fantastic! that might just work. as for the reports and potential accountability
everyone believes helm master yukong had retired they don't know that she chose an even harder path after she left her beloved skies behind.
i'll be staying on the outside -- i need to make sure the system projections remain stable. mister leonard is here as well. there's no need to worry. we will guarantee your safety.
mister svarog, it's such a massive vein. i've never seen so much geomarrow before
a small stage is crowded with a bunch of scheming people. none of them want to be exposed under the spotlight, so they all push you to the front
i know mister svarog. he isn't affected by other people's wishes. he only follows logical judgments.
see the markings on the wall over there? all you need to do is use the jade abacus's image recorder to capture all of them, and you'll be able to reach this zone's contender
she did -- she saw me on her way over. she told me to go to the repository and read up on anything related to the ambrosial arbor.
i've heard the story of long the permanence and their descendants. many myths and legends praise the aeon for a rich and immortal life.
however, i asked dan heng back on the express to confirm that story about the annihilation gang and the lost messages it wasn't something that aventurine made up out of thin air.
with what power belobog currently holds, we are far from being able to assist the nameless however, i do hope that one day we can provide you with reliable support.
let me guess -- something to do with these unruly people in black showing up everywhere?
do you recognize this bottle of medicine in my hand?
case closed! i never knew catching heliobi would require so much work
no no no, hey, you can save that for the enemy!
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
maybe you're right, or not. right now i just need more time to think.
yeah, i heard them, too, but i'm afraid i'll have to disappoint them. i've already reported to general jing yuan that i'll give up my role as the ringmaster.
truth be told, i can't just drop my work and leave belobog.
one who wears a blade must use it to cut eventually. and when a gambler has nothing to lose on the table, he will surely go for broke and bet it all on a final hand... that is all i can say.
it's too late for nerves now. it's almost time!
thank you for enlightening me. was it for the same reason that you "traded off" my mentor to the xianzhou zhuming, only to stand idle and allow the resurgence of the disciples of sanctus medicus?
do you not see whose name it is on the desk? hmph, i can come and go as i wish. besides, if anyone is going to leave, it definitely won't be me.
yukong's inner worries and concerns came to the surface in the presence of her daughter. only then was it clear that she, too, is somebody's mother.
besides, didn't you say some of the miners were gravely injured? lives are on the line
yes. i never observed it directly, but i used lab simulations and outbound surveys to establish a rough location.
so herta hides her collection with something as simple as this?
that's why the moment i laid eyes on him, a chill ran down my spine. march is right -- we shouldn't judge a book by its cover but i can't overlook this.
phew it looks like i still have a long way to go.
i have a question for you that i am hesitant to ask
i think she was one of imbibitor lunae's comrades.
ah, but that doesn't mean that time has stopped in the dream. to avoid any physical or mental burden on guests, time in the dream has been synced with reality's, so don't worry!
hear ye! the rosy glow of the beauty has rendered you speechless -- what an honor!
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
remain vigilant at all times. any suspicious movements must be suppressed as quickly as possible before the situation gets out of hand.
different matters have different priorities. there are more urgent issues that need our attention right now.
aah no wonder those two ignored me.
i'll head back to the dock for now. thanks for all the hard work by the way -- hope things work out just as smoothly down the line.
go now. you are free -- o chosen one, who dared to exceed his bounds. sever your wings, descend to the mortal realm, and walk their lands. see what this world is truly like.
so are you from one of the other xianzhou ships? the yaoqing? the fanghu?
man, this is area is so run-down i wouldn't wanna live here.
wrong. none of it would have been possible without winning the hearts of local businesses.
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
watch your words, no need to be aggressive here
if you're really anxious about it, i can stay here and have a chat with you.
strange why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something
save your explanation for the judge. you are charged with sabotaging the silvermane guard restricted zone. in my capacity as captain, i hereby order that these fugitives be arrested!
oh? well it's an honor to be in your dreams, my friend.
how are you finding your first trailblazing expedition?
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
paperfold university was established during the pioneering era. it was initially a training ground for dreamweavers and was founded by glaux, head of the nightingale family.
thank you for inviting me onto the express! if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the zhuming!
rest easy, the madam guardian doesn't care about formalities. not to mention, you've only just arrived, it would be unexpected if you were familiar with belobog customs.
it's a shame, though, that this pawnshop can't give me what i desire. my last attempt in penacony well, it ends with "hope."
oh, hey there slowpokes! i was starting to think you weren't gonna show up.
this place could do with some iris scanners... wouldn't want unregistered visitors sneaking aboard.
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
oh, yanqing, so young, yet so grown-up by the way, how old are you exactly?
i'll find another chance to talk with you all. i'd like to express my gratitude to the astral express for helping the luofu during the crisis.
this is a tuskpir of the xianzhou zhuming: warm, sweet, not for consumption.
by the way, yanqing, is it normal to have so many people wandering around in an automated area like the stargazer navalia?
fear not, unless i wipe away your memories, forgetting me is not an option~
do you accept my challenge, miss yunli?
excuse me, gentlemen. would this blonde-haired, life-saving outworlder bear any resemblance to our suspect, here?
with his strength, hoolay united numerous borisin packs, forming a grand army of abominations of abundance. they constantly pushed the alliance's armies into perilous positions.
let me put it bluntly -- aurum alley merchant guild has no chance of succeeding today.
stargazer navalia may have come to a standstill, but the alarms are operational how did she get through here?
oh, here it says, "enter the door to start your adventure." you have to climb inside from there to start your challenge, pal.
don't look down on me just because i'm a new recruit~
food in the dream shouldn't taste bad, right?
but folks from the realm-keeping commission descended on the area. it's too loud over there now pass! pass!
looks like someone needs help let's go check it out.
stand aside, rookie. let me show you how we zhuming swordmasters treat their apprentices.
i know this is a lot to ask out of the blue, so apologies in advance.
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
how hard is it to choose a destination? we're going to stargazer navalia -- problem solved.
it could indeed be considered a souvenir of a certain variety. but not one you could find in a gift store.
i told you, i was only just transferred here from the yaoqing. i don't come here very often.
while i trust the bravery of the divine foresight and the nameless, i'm curious about some details missing from the report. i'd like to take this chance to have an exchange with both of you.
hmm. it's clear that whoever designed these mechanisms didn't want outsiders to get through too easily. let's keep looking for the energy hub.
what is the situation at the shackling prison?
for some reason, seeing the skysplitter has boosted my confidence. so, i've decided to conserve my strength for tomorrow.
svarog, based on your calculations do you think i can beat yanqing?
miss bailu is already waiting at scalegorge waterscape.
you should keep your sword sharp at all times.
no, mother would never do that to me there's no way she would.
when i was little, he told me that if there was anyone in the world who knew the answer, it would be the reignbow arbiter.
now that you've had your fun, it'd be wise to leave before it's too late. the music of the harmony doesn't tolerate discord.
we mustn't fail her determination. i'm not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.
it's okay, you can reveal yourself now.
maybe there's more to it? it's not like i would know, i'm a mere amicassador.
there is no death inside penacony's dreamscape. that's the promise of the family and the blessing of the harmony. not even a memokeeper can break this barrier.
look -- "exalting sanctum" -- this is a safe place. let's just walk the rest of the way from here.
uhh, i was just storing a few relics away from prying eyes, nothing serious. if it weren't for the uncompromising nature of our civil service, there'd be no need for secrecy.
your sense of humor is just as sharp as when we first met.
you've guessed correctly. the person that stands before you is tonight's starring role.
huh? could it be pascal has been repairing this abandoned town?
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
you've already heard of my humble title elsewhere? i am deeply honored!
and because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
there's no end to this. let me try.
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
the flint emperor would aid the xianzhou in battle, and if they were victorious, the hero and their followers would lose their physical bodies for eternity.
miss march's sword skills are really coming along. she'll hold her own just fine in the wardance.
i apologize, general. i'm afraid the next move will have to be made on the xuling.
sometimes i just put on a wig, change my makeup, and slip on a pair of glasses - just like that, i can go anywhere without a worry~
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
"those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh."
the security of the luofu is more important to me than anything else. i need to fulfill my duties as a cloud knight lieutenant before taking on the honor of being a ringmaster.
what's up with that? now the family's toys are trying to frame me? i didn't do a thing to it, doc. you've gotta be my witness.
me? you guys scared me to death there i was looking for relics to sell, when all of a sudden you came stomping over. i thought the silvermane guards were paying me a visit.
i was due a visit, so i thought i'd bring you a gift. nothing too precious, just my way of saying thank you!
that's why i chose this place. i want to show all those people who laughed at me that i can stand on my own two feet again.
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
he took on the charge of pursuing a major criminal -- it is not my place to impede him for fear of his wellbeing. that is the nature of the cloud knights and their duty.
here we are. this is the place.
hmm i don't know how to deal with people like that.
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
still stable, i suppose. do you still remember the medic who saved me in battle?
what would we do if we were the escapees from the shackling prison? while we can disguise ourselves and blend in with the crowd, we don't plan on staying here for long. in this case, what do we need most now?
it's a pity... the laurels of victory belong to idrila!
i just don't understand why are you so fixated on this minor case and constantly escalating it? seriously, what's your purpose?
pascal's consciousness does not appear to have returned to the level shown in the diary
naturally. however, while you're deliberating, my colleagues will need to carry out some operations in belobog. i hope that your subjects in the underworld are cooperative.
ah, look at the time. the guest is almost here. if you're curious, just follow the crowd. miss asta and i will be there soon...
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
it's unlikely we'll hear from polka kakamond. she's been off the grid for quite some time.
the hint for the final question was a little too obvious.
publicly insulting the supreme guardian only elevates the seriousness of your crimes. throw down your arms and surrender!
which road? i should head there myself -- a divine object like this possesses a market value of at least twenty thousand strales.
i think this device of yours is probably worth a lot. it might be a good idea to try your luck with balaway.
what i mean is that you don't require medication. just stroll around the luofu more and take in the barrage of new sights and sounds. stop drinking sweet dreams soda and your symptoms will disappear in a few days.
as a non-member, not a clue. they'd never tell me their ultimate aims. shame, really, it's not like i'm a blabbermouth
now, from the gold, blue, and rainbow decks of cards, please pick the deck that fits you best.
since you already know wonweek's secret, there's no need for me to build up suspense.
following grandpa's plan, our disciple march is taking your place as ringmaster aren't you proud of her?
i didn't steal the sword.
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
no need for formalities, asta. herta space station is where knowledge converges. here, we celebrate the equality of thought.
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
i guess i'll leave you to rest up a bit for the time being. by the way, what's your beacon address? that way if anything happens, i can contact you.
please, mister svarog
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
never mind. just don't look so lost when we're in class later, or you might just sleep yourself to dreamflux reef.
hello. could you tell me more about the radiant feldspar?
yes. there were detailed notes, so... i wanted to give them a try.
cut! you have finished your exam. let's take a look at your results
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel
i've already seen your abilities -- there's nothing to be nervous about.
so much for your memory. did you forget the architects expelled me ages ago?
alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you for now.
in the throes of combat, where life and death hinge on a singular moment, every idea fades into nothingness. the only thing that matters is "staying alive."
do you remember how we took in that little charmony dove when we were young?
"not all journeys lead to the stars." even if we leave the express, some trailblazing paths will still continue.
i'd be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.
if we landaus have one thing in common, it's that we're all stubborn in our own way.
after we arrived on the xianzhou, the mara in him flared up so violently that even my spirit whisper couldn't suppress it. he's not fit for interstellar travel in this state.
you had had your wish. now, i'm offering you a chance to regain your freedom not by letting you go, but by going back to the way things were. do we have a deal?
and my karma has nothing to do with you, mister gopher wood.
sorry, i don't mean to sound so formal. once you reach my age, it's difficult to make new friends
i see. i'll make a genuine, heartfelt apology to her
i admit i'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. but this is also a safe place.
welcome to reality. more specifically, the reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
you are right, though. looking at the interior decoration, you can tell that trailblazers have quite good taste.
sorry... i was just trying to help.
and the prime suspect? the one with the blue hair?
in the name of the architects, i shall stick this spear into your nostril!
she received an invitation from the ipc before the attack occurred.
they came for me -- i'm sorry you got dragged into it.
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
well then, it's time you felt the power of "mechanical fever!" pela, let's show them what we're made of!
stop struggling, hoolay. there's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to the shackling prison.
fine, show me your past.
all i can say is that i sympathize with your situation. rest easy. wildfire won't go behind your back on this.
it's not so bad at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
thanks to him, i'm able to make time for the people. i do my best to make sure that they have everything they need at the same time, i was formulating a plan to deal with svarog.
"the simulated universe is bound to make errors." you said that yourself, and that's exactly what we're experiencing. why is it a problem all of a sudden?
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair
and because of that, he bid farewell to the express and never walked among the stars again in his lifetime.
incredible! no wonder the astral express is so highly regarded!
i must give him a chance, seele, because other people can't.
it's a tad embarrassing, but i managed to prick my finger while embroidering just now.
we don't know where the victims went, but duke inferno's plan is now clear.
so, let me introduce myself. i'm the intelligence officer for the silvermane guards, and a temporary guide for the "a journey through belobog's history" program. my name is pelageya sergeyevna.
that's called a united front, got it?!
you're a great fighter, but your perception is even more impressive. no matter how well a treasure chest is hidden, you're always able to spot it
we've never even met before, yet here you are, offering your help, just as before. i should've treated you with respect, but fear of phantylia made me act like somebody else.
robin believed it was because the harmony had been tampered with somehow, but as far as i know, there aren't many entities capable of interfering with the power of paths.
you remember that norbert guy we captured? the silvermane guards have acquired new intel from him -- i thought you might find it interesting.
a devastator glaive? is this from the battle? there were a lot of cloud knights.
the report did mention abnormalities in the surveillance system and module errors... we'll have to start prioritizing those issues.
diting should be able to pick up her traces now.
that thought has brought me great comfort, and now i know how to speak to you properly.
you don't need to worry about me. oleg guaranteed that i wouldn't be harmed. he seemed like a man of his word. go and rest.
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
phantylia won't be stirring up trouble any time soon -- don't worry about her infecting the arbor again. it's just that sealing the stellaron is going to take some time
to be here, reclining and watching shining constellations come and go as time passes one by there could be nothing more pleasant.
sorry, what i mean is hmm. it's difficult to explain, but my instinct tells me this luocha is involved somehow.
sparkle was disguised as sparkle's body.
as always, to follow in the footsteps of akivili.
i understand. the more that weighs on your mind, the more your fears become dreamscapes.
of course, i know! well, i know a little. my mum made me practice with swords all day -- i didn't really go to school
well, in the end, i'm to blame. living such a long life naturally brings its share of disapproval.
now, if you want to return to your normal size, you have to do everything that hanu has done in the cartoon series -- or you can just touch this tv.
in my opinion, there is no murderer for this case.
hmph! didn't think you'd accuse me of goofing off never mind the gift i got for you then
hold on a minute diamond picked you for this project? i was expecting someone like opal or obsidian to handle it -- at least somebody higher than rank pforty-six
uh, i'm not sure this falls under "petty crime," seele -- that's a whole robot he's got next to him. it's big ben alright.
it's an amazing feeling for someone who's never left belobog before.
then we'll build a no, we'll build a whole lot of them -- trains that look just like the astral express.
divination commission? celestial jade? shouldn't they be doing divinations?
there was a serious-looking fella looking after the shop. he was probably a few years younger than me, but his hair and beard were white as snow. there was a young lad doing odd jobs -- he looked pretty exhausted.
the starskiff is ready for the ceremony now. everyone, please place your objects aboard the starskiff.
have you decided on what to do with this guy?
as you were. we must not be tempted into careless judgment. look at their relics. we've never excavated anything like them before, and i haven't seen anything similar in our museums.
her parents used to be artisans in the commission, so i think she has some nostalgic connection to the place.
then keep that fire burning and learn with all your heart.
your ship can leave whenever you want, but i'm afraid i can't say the same for the cargo.
since you're all here, how about we let miss serval and miss pela, our championship contenders, explain the rules to everyone?
huh, and what prompted the mighty aventurine to start collaborating with others?
this is a temporary interchange, so it looks a little rundown the reverie in the dreamscape is currently undergoing a revamp.
well, alright. then i'll guess... he's going to promote me to pforty-six?
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
the garden of recollection has eyes everywhere. if he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the memokeepers -- i've warned him about that.
how could the mighty xianzhou alliance be breached by a stellaron
that's fine if you're not on the clock, but you can't just lie down at work!
yes it's risky, but we can only wait until both sides have played their cards before making any further judgments.
but for you, cirrus, this game was never about fairness, was it? and yet here we are -- my power decidedly outmatches yours.
if she had it her way, miss seele would spend less time yelling at me and more time actively trying to hit me. can someone explain what i did to deserve her?
he fooled the silvermane guards into thinking he'd changed but we won't be falling for that act again any time soon!
unsheathe your swords and get ready, miss march! the duel starts now!
my apologies, i have a lot of business to attend to at present -- i won't be joining you. good luck recovering the stolen items.
wandering the universe on the astral express *sigh* one can only be envious!
alright, but there are doors all over the place which one should we choose? do you have any idea, misha?
now that we're done with our tour of the skysplitter, shall we continue with our training?
welcome back. i appreciate your help more than i can express -- it couldn't have been easy running all over the city.
off you go, mister aventurine. you are free. i will wait here for your good news.
asters, you know, asters
in the meantime, i'll follow up on the exhibit theft case. i wonder if any new clues were found over in svarog's domain
the pastries that the zhuming is known for are mostly salty-sweet or smokey in flavor. so there's no way i can resist this kind of pure sweetness.
it looks like our theory has already been confirmed.
under the might of an aeon, the sacrifices of ordinary creatures are but a joke we are nothing we mean nothing
by the end of the battle, only a few of us remained. "the crimson moon casts the sheen of blood on all" everything i saw was painted dark red.
that's okay. these components are really common. maybe we can find a spare one in the ruins around here.
that sounds lovely. but i do have a meeting with herta, so let's put the new surprises on hold for now.
this is an automated area, so don't you think that there are a bit too many people here today?
i happen to have some medical knowledge -- perhaps i can treat the young lady's injuries.
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
so you guys been having fun?
the people of belobog hold both of you in high regard. they'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
miss seele, did this medicine belong to miss natasha? then can you give me some? the vagrants' injuries are quite serious.
if you're all out of options, please get in touch with me. i'm the kind of person who values friendship highly.
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
i sense that we're very near to the northern snow plains.
haha. i'm afraid i still have duties to attend to. i must return to my post. i hope you enjoy your stay in belobog.
if i'm not wrong, we need to find a way to open this door in the hall, or this place will be our prison.
is that so? well, i've got something for you.
--seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. with you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
whether our destination lies before us or behind us, the decision is ours to make. here, as on the express, every vote counts.
don't let him fool you. everyone in the underworld knows that this brat is a no-good thief. if i remember correctly, even the clothes you're wearing came off another kid's back?
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
a healer's medicine might remedy one's physical health, but sometimes the loneliness and hurt inside one's heart needs companionship and care to heal.
that actually doesn't make much sense. even if they were on bad terms, those three
belobog's future is not for sale, and we'll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need -- not once, but twice.
hey! an honor to meet you, boss svarog! i'm luka, a senior member of wildfire, just like seele.
do you know why the antimatter legion would invade the station, arlan?
i just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
bladie, listen to me: unleash the mara.
why the long face, my child? are you feeling regret, perhaps?
you can't work your way out of writer's block! a short break is a good way of refreshing the mind.
um, well, how can my friends have vip cards when they've only just arrived, haha.
i get it -- you're scared. i'm scared too. i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
do i sound that negative? no. we believe that existence has meaning, but that meaning is bestowed by ourselves, not by choices.
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
this is a medal given to me by the architects see that blue stone in the middle? that's a geomarrow crystal of the highest purity.
in that case as a leader, i must give you a promise of the same weight.
why are you looking at me? want a medal or something? it does kinda sound like a good idea
we need the support of the merchants for the dock, and we wanted to see if your father could join us
i didn't lie to you, right? i told you i'd bring you somewhere safe, and i did! though we did take a bit of a detour
there are people born impoverished who don't know what hope is. there are also people born broken who do not know what it's like to be whole
i i guess we do.
there are more urgent issues that need to be taken care of first.
my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
if at the end of the day you did not unsheathe your blade... i would have lost the bet.
monkeys and a ninja that doesn't sound like something that happened in penacony. seems more like a dream bubble.
in stargazer navalia? mm let's go with you and have a look.
the auction, the one at the vagrant camp?
i suppose we can slow down for now then
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means
the express was struck from behind by another vessel.
whoa, whoa! pry it open? in front of all these vagrants and robots? they have eyes, you know.
you seem to be interested in learning about your past life
eversummer was that always the name? seems i was too young to get the irony back then.
nevertheless, the enemy is upon us and time is of the essence -- let us not allow monetary affairs to cast a shadow over more pressing matters.
so the event's sponsor is here too? is today some sort of special occasion or something?
the paperwork will have to wait. i'm coming with you.
you're very curious about my work, aren't you?
the way i handled the jarilo case was approved by senior management, and all of the project logs and call records are complete. can't you check them yourselves?
very well, since the president has come to a decision, i will be in charge of calling a public meeting.
keen intuition, but that layer of my identity isn't important. i am only here because of my fastidiousness toward the theatrical arts.
satisfied with our transaction, i trust? cast your eyes to the future, and you'll realize we both stand to gain from a little mutual understanding.
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
that's right, no one else in aurum alley needs to worry -- it's all on me.
this one goes past the divination commission and the artisanship commission
i didn't know the sky-faring commission were history buffs! not bad, younger generations usually don't know much about it. it's said that the ambrosial arbor is an ancient remnant from when the xianzhou roamed the ether.
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
pascal's trail leads in that direction. let's follow it.
he gave me a pass for access across the space station while on patrol.
past the reception hall, you'll find the general hall -- the museum's largest exhibition room.
make sure to take good care of it until the opening of the charmony festival. then, when the show reaches its climax -- press the button together with the others around you
we took this picture before we parted ways. despite feeling crestfallen that day, he still kept a smile on his face.
heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. there are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us why don't we just leave it at that for now?
then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? as for the debt we'll find a way to gradually repay it, but it'll take some time
unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. the clamor is not fitting for desserts. by the way
mister yang, i just want to tell you this: the harmony has more than one side. they can be the most steadfast ally of the astral express or the most fearsome enemy.
i was a child when i first visited the grand theater. i remember seeing the light behind the curtains from here and believing it to be the morning star guiding me toward the land of the dreams.
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
"the xianzhou luofu cordially invites jarilo-vi's warriors to join the wardance."
i forgot to introduce myself. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
so when he says stuff like "this is for training" -- that's probably a lie. he's hiding something from you alright.
it reminds me of a ring. i imagine crafting it, and then adding a bracelet of beads to complement its soft, lustrous glow.
obviously, there is someone behind the scenes orchestrating this prison break, intending to spread chaos. if we fail to thwart their evil plan, what honor will be left for us to uphold?
eventually, she became the head of the entire commission, which required her to learn patience and adopt a meticulous approach to her work.
yeah, i brought you here because the general said he had some important matters to discuss. but how in the world did yunli and i suddenly become miss march's swordplay mentors?
hahaha, if it isn't the galactic baseballer -- a hero with unparalleled insight!
there's no need to take such great pains. if you just want confirmation i've already told you the answer, miss sparkle.
thieves are rife during times of celebration.
ugh, what are all these enemies doing on the luofu!?
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
yes, i intend to participate in the efforts as well.
yes i originally thought the head of the sky-faring commission was a suave businesswoman -- like that young foxian girl
our priority is to return to safety. let's keep moving.
what defines a fool is the inability to recognize their own shortcomings. don't let that be you.
yes. what is making her so nervous?
oh, really? "only" sixteen system hours? well, let me lend you a hand.
my colleagues from the merchant guild promotion department came up with a slogan, "reclaim aurum alley's golden glory!"
miss sparkle also used it to attack mister shamari.
you know mingxi better than i do. would she deceive you with fake data?
or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
please make sure you keep your personal belongings safe -- pickpockets tend to take advantage of events like this. we'll be performing additional patrols.
their future has already been purchased. all i can do is make them accept this fact, using a relatively peaceful approach.
you said this was the first step, right? so just how many steps does your training have, exactly?
actually, after i got your invitation, i couldn't stop imagining what the express looked like on the inside. i got so excited about it that i couldn't fall asleep all night.
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
did the medicine have any side effects for you?
what are you up to? i only just convinced her everything's fine, you know
when ruan mei visited the luofu earlier, she mentioned what happened to you. this coincided with when the message sent by the astral express arrived.
no, i never issued such an order.
this is why the cloud knights lost control and became mara-struck?
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
c'mon if you learned how to play, then you, welt, and march would only need to find one more person! you could get a table going and play a few rounds during your travels.
the city? already? i haven't even started trading yet. showing you the way is easy enough, missy, but it would cost--
why of course you're welcome! they've mentioned that your team is a trusted ally of the ipc in penacony, so there's no reason not to welcome you.
friends? oh, please. you guys only treat others as your bargaining chips.
look at you, snooping around and sticking your nose everywhere
to put it into short-life terms -- a funeral. you see, for long-life species of the xianzhou, death has always been a distant, mystical concept.
really... but that shopkeeper said that this equally splendid rainbowite is the product of rainbow seeds.
you have a clever tongue. i like it.
qingni picked the road she yearned for, just like her mother. there's no reason to feel remorse it makes me wonder, who's really grappling with regrets?
the difference is we're making a stand for freedom while they're just carrying out orders.
always keep that in mind, and don't forget the way of the trailblaze: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
he has a new life now. he is no longer the old friend i once knew.
to the express, stellarons act as roadblocks on the silver rail and pose risks to the warping process. and that's why dealing with stellaron issues is part of the duty of the nameless.
it's so white and fluffy! where can i find a live one?
...so, come with me. i'll take you home.
well would you believe me if i said yes?
on the stellaron hunters' wanted posters, they stand accused of inciting the jepella rebellion -- the uprising that caused the downfall of the brotherhood.
unfortunately, that legendary figure is no more. i'm only a reflection of his life.
i was piloting the "one and only" through the galaxy when i discovered velite, an ipc worker who accidentally fell into a huge cave, from which i saved him.
are you really from the divination commission?
like right now for example. it's just about time my final "guest" boarded the ship.
(doctor edward said he didn't have the time to make any alternative storylines. just accept it.)
dislike? we were like sisters once -- inseparable. of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian
though bailu has been worshiped as the high elder since birth and had no say in this, her title of healer lady was indeed gained from her expert practice of medicine.
but you said so yourself: this could concern the trailblaze.
yes, but only for those who cross the line. melting their swords is my way of protecting those weapons.
may i have the honor of knowing your name?
because of the nihility, i'm rarely affected by the power of other paths, but somehow i can unconsciously infiltrate them... maybe that's the "risk" they're trying to avoid.
i was simply being overly cautious. it is a habit of mine. apologies.
that man wants to see you again.
i doubt i'm in any position to be proposing ideas, but i'm happy to defer to the nameless and aid with any plans you may have.
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
i see. but when it's so obvious, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
oh, it looks like we have some visitors!
uhh uh, y--yeah! i mean, if you'd fought in the final round and won, you'd have incredible street cred right now! wildfire wouldn't think twice about talking with you. i don't see the problem.
this mural describes the vidyadhara hatching rebirth in the lunarescent depths -- the beginning of self-reincarnation.
i think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
heliobus, is it not your deepest wish to hold a rematch with the general of the luofu? i have come to grant you an audience.
i'm afraid i'll also have to return to the express first. the conductor is worried about us. it's best i go and explain the situation.
mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. and, after he left, it became three.
she's been down in the dumps ever since she lost tail.
guinaifen might not realize it, but by living her life like a roaring fire, she also illuminates the lives of others like the little flame under a hot pot.
the prelude prepared for the climax is all ready elsewhere
bronya! i don't know what happened between you and them. even if you explained it to me, i probably wouldn't understand all the crazy details. but there are two things i do know
i can understand your impatience, and i know you want to prove yourself. now is not the time. if you truly wish to become sword champion, you shouldn't be running around brandishing your sword at people, especially not a major criminal.
the marshal ordered me to come to the xianzhou luofu, but the document only says: "attend the wardance and listen to feixiao's questioning."
people are like a giant tree, closely intertwined and ever-growing. people shape history, history creates heroes, heroes inspire the future, and the future brings forth new people.
still, it's a pleasure for me to be able to say that the xianzhou has captured a criminal wanted by the ipc, haha.
if i'm not mistaken, the two of you just rushed over here from the history and culture museum? i appreciate your coming here on such short notice.
yeah! all the challenges of everyday life seem to disappear when you gaze out into the universe.
that's a shipwright's soldering gun, i think one of the workers here must have left it behind.
looks like aventurine doesn't need anything else -- let's turn our attention to the family's assignment for now. himeko, what do you think?
they are still a long way from becoming geniuses and are therefore unable to discern whether this love is one of friendship, romance, or familial love.
a perfectly clear statement turned confusing thanks to your translation -- you've made me lose where i was now. anyway, this is how i operate in battle, so you might as well get used to it.
i'm not alone then. i'll be keeping a safe distance.
we've reached the end. these are the roots of the ambrosial arbor, where the vestiges of abundance lie.
the situation isn't clear. we shouldn't act rashly. after all, we're currently here as guest students.
alright, let's not keep the general waiting.
let's stay calm -- i need some time to check the engine with himeko. for now, just try and take your minds off the situation.
you guessed it! everyone agrees that there is no better candidate than you.
they have seen your faith, and have endorsed your faith. with this, it can be evidenced--
i enjoy being alone, especially when i have important work to do.
huohuo has been browsing ghostly grove for hours. every time she finds a suspicious incident, she says: "do you think tail did this?"
i trust my intuition more than any words.
craft a mask based on a personality type
let's not let our imaginations get the better of us.
since you're here i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
oh, as for you the chief will decide your fate when we see him.
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
if it looks like a hot pot, smells like a hot pot, and acts like a hot pot i can only diagnose him as being a hot pot.
i'll leave miss tingyun in your hands.
careful, these traces are fresh. our unsought guest isn't far away.
sorry i'll be sure to make it up to you.
the same is true of life. whether the end is predestined or not, it's worth living.
and miss firefly, we thank you for all your support. we're faced with a formidable enemy. as long as the astral express and stellaron hunters' objectives are aligned, we're willing to cooperate with you.
now that you've decided, i don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. i think you're making the right choice, bronya.
it is said that the space station also contains madam herta's private chamber where her most precious, rare, and dangerous collections are sealed... and for someone like her, it's not out of the realm of possibility.
don't get so worked up, seele! i'm thinking clearly! plus, didn't we just get rid of another major threat to the underworld?
but there's one more thing i wish to do. since this is our last stop, could i have a word with you two in private? perhaps somewhere more secluded. i'd like to discuss a personal matter.
so, miss yunli has already agreed. what do you say, yanqing?
the story behind this guitar huh, it'll take a while to tell.
the information about robin, firefly... and the other victims... i don't see any commonalities among them.
if you want to advance further northward, you must traverse an area entirely corroded by the fragmentum. it's the only way to get to the snow plains on the other side.
hey! that's not nice! wildfire made a request and i got on with the job.
speaking of which, i noticed something recently!
bringing you to belobog was a grave error.
wildfire's relationship with svarog has been hostile for a long time now, accompanying you would only lead to misunderstandings. we'll be nearby, awaiting orders. if things go south, we'll be there in no time.
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
i heard from xikui that it was you who became a business advisor and assisted aurum alley merchant guild in their dispute with the ipc how versatile. is there anything you can't do?
there's supposed to be a passage why can't i see it?
let's go. the waiting area is in the open classroom.
if that's the case, shouldn't we immediately go there and join forces to eliminate the borisin? why are we returning to stargazer navalia?
mumbling?! i'm praying!
you should have some mixed vegetable juice before bed -- it helps you sleep. well, i'm on night duty tonight. see you tomorrow.
that's right. grandpa always said that facing difficulties is part of becoming a hero.
many people seem to like talking about how my sister changed since she left the guards, but in reality she's exactly the same person.
our paradise is none of your concern, masked fool. leave now, or the family won't tolerate you anymore.
there. now do you see what i mean, mister yang?
after the downfall of the oak family, old oti's faction became the dominant force in penacony. even if we consider only the succession order, he's the longest-serving and most senior among all the family heads.
personally, i think all these rumors are meaningless drivel. across the sea of stars, the divine foresight knows better than anyone else what happened on the luofu and the meaning behind it
don't worry about it. you should sleep for a little longer. by the time you wake up, you won't remember any of these details.
let's leave it at that. for now, i'll choose to believe that you bear no hostility.
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
please lead the way, your honor.
if you still have concerns, you are also free to restrain me while he performs the tuning.
it's not like that! she just has many responsibilities to bear. i don't completely understand, i trust that she's trying to solve the problem.
lady bronya wants belobog to heal, so the silvermane guards need to regain the people's trust. but we won't achieve that by kicking doors open and policing everyone around.
we made our inventory more efficient, but the dock workers said we still need a way to distribute the goods. i was wondering if heron express would be interested
you were attacked by a lord ravager. by all rights, you should not have survived.
you can call me whatever you like. look serval, i'm here on official business today. there's something wrong with the barrier generator device and the engineers in our unit don't know how to fix it. i need you to take a look.
i'd like to think their steady ticking can be comforting, keeping you company on your long trips.
there is unfinished business between me and the maker of this weapon.
great idea! shame we don't have any.
what worries me most is how lady bronya will handle the backlash from her people. will she be able to withstand the criticism? is she prepared to carry the weight of a tarnished reputation for years to come?
are you going to help this um, clockie that only you can see?
seems like only dan heng has a kind word for my coffee. what do you think? well, i've always thought that bitter is better
surviving the battlefield reshapes all notions of worth. be it integrity or treachery, in my eyes, their significance is negligible.
i gotta admit, i had a lot of misunderstandings about the silvermane guards. they're fighting for survival here every day, just like wildfire.
alright, that's enough. i'm not going to repeat myself a hundred times.
do you really want to leave belobog and go with the trailblazers?
y'know, whenever the express stops at the station platform, i make a point of getting a few visits in.
know myself and know the enemy let's see, who should i ask first?
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you
it's just like you said: an inability rather than an unwillingness. plus it's a long story not something that can be summed up in a few words.
we're telling the truth. you could verify it yourself by checking the access history of the jade gate.
you don't want to know about her motives and your past?
sushang has a good sword, but a good sword is not always an easy-to-use sword. one needs to apply ten times more power to make it perform just one-tenth better.
no kidding! i could tell you weren't locals from a mile away, but i didn't expect to run into two nameless here! fate is such a curious thing~
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
allow me to introduce you to general huaiyan. he's the arbiter-general of the xianzhou zhuming, known as the flaming heart.
what's the fastest way to the bottom of this prison, miss hanya? if we don't get there quickly, we'll soon be outnumbered by all the enemies inside.
*sigh* i'm tired of packing. let's leave it here for today. thanks for your help.
ugh, the culprit is still hiding in the shadows. can't we find even one lead?
protecting the interests of the vast majority of people is the reason i chose this career path. the ipc has given me an excellent platform to pursue my goals and for that, i have nothing to complain about.
seems like you've seen your fair share of immersia, miss march. but if you want my opinion, if your goal is self-improvement, you'll feel just as accomplished even if you put down the sword and go back to your bow.
that sounds like both buttons can do the exact same thing?
hey, this is not how it's supposed to be, right? the xianzhou is known for its tea culture and hospitality, but you're not treating me like a guest at all! seriously, am i not a guest?
one day, this rage will ignite and burn me alive. i will become the very monster that the reignbow lux arrow hunts
well, in my opinion, sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the order is right.
aside from starskiff performances, it's mostly martial contests, nothing too different from the taikiyan roboball contest we've seen before.
cut! assistant director, change the scene, please.
three, two, one
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
if you have trouble handling these beginner spirits it might indicate that this game isn't the best choice for you.
draw your sword. don't you know it's rude to keep an elder waiting?
for mortals, even if they possess the great power of a path, they can't create a flawless world like gods do.
the impairments of short-life species can be corrected with ingenia or surgery, but that's an impossibility for xianzhou natives.
a world that many across the universe don't even know exists
since you agreed, i'll take you at your word!
what do you think, himeko? since we've accepted miss black swan's proposal, we should probably head to amphoreus for refueling.
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
sorry, i can't answer that question. that ranger is shrouded in mystery. i'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
is that so... i recall that shopkeeper said that this equally splendid rainbowite is the product of rainbow seeds.
we won't reveal the names of any victims. we'll just post some pics and videos of the squad engaging in fierce battles with the supernatural! and then come up with some dramatic titles
i'm afraid i won't be taking your words at face value. not after how you wielded the power of harmony.
thanks, little bro! really sorry for the trouble it's my first time visiting another civilization
i know. but since we were looking for food, i figured we might as well try to fix the stove.
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee)
i've grasped the situation of the prison break. now, tell me more about the current state of the shackling prison.
come on! it's been so long since we last met each other. how can you just walk away like that?
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it
however, for some reason, pascal keeps getting attacked by his fellow robots, because the automatons think he's a fragmentum creature.
well, my granddaughter has always been stubborn. are you really sure about this, yunli?
but as the fight was nearing its end, he suddenly stopped and left the arena
is the smell of "death" so enticing, my fine fellow?
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
so, you're the one that mailed the letter to the express.
such is the fate that awaits you, cirrus.
i will now bring you to see madam cocolia. please have your words at the ready. her time is precious, so she prefers concise communication.
so the coach of my opponent for my first match, is going to give me tactical advice in the ring? i am bewildered by the xianzhou people's hospitality.
i'm relieved to know that you're safe and sound. well then, since you and elder huaiyan are here, i imagine you must have received orders from the marshal?
i can't believe my own eyes either, but i know that sculpture inside and out.
all i can say is that it's in character for her to say something and then do it without thinking. she's always been impulsive, and she doesn't mind creating a headache or two along the way
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master"
not a lot of people out there could've fought the mara-struck like you did. i'm only a civil servant -- i can't imagine what kafka would do to me if i were caught in the fray
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said if you need something from us, just say the word.
just like the master diviner -- no matter what cruel and horrible paths she foresaw, as long as it benefited the luofu, she had to make a choice.
my name is dan heng. i'm a traveler. i'm on my way to meet up with my friends. i appreciate the help, but i can leave the port on my own.
in my view, that's combat aesthetics at its finest.
i came here to listen to your explanation. but i never imagined that, besides being good at preaching, you'd also have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.
i'm afraid i can't reveal that -- mister giovanni specifically reminded me to keep some "surprises" in store for you.
i don't have any concrete evidence but i think he's worth checking out.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
(oh, really? well you know what they say -- great minds dream alike!)
but her expertise went far beyond stellarons. she was and still is well versed in mechanical engineering and other fields.
the knights of beauty each pursue their own goals, venturing down different paths. that is our destiny.
i haven't fought with gepard since he enlisted. he could never beat me when we were little, but now
i have to admit, talking to you is always such a pleasure. i apologize for my behavior just now, it was inappropriate.
a looming crisis can often lie hidden beneath the illusion of prosperity, unnoticed by many.
well done. i admit i underestimated you, but what difference would it make?
perhaps the best part is that even with so many present, there's a delightful scarcity of simpletons.
but there are some things i find difficult to forget. i feel it's only right that i tell you what's on my mind before we part ways.
usually only emissaries from the xianzhou yaoqing's sky-faring commission visit him once every century. why do you have to visit him now, of all times?
if one carries a blade, it's bound to be used to cut something down. my reason for drawing my sword -- past, present, or future -- remains singular.
remember, your first instinct is very important.
guess what? a brave soul approached me in secret earlier, encouraging me to defeat you and seek revenge for all the people in aurum alley!
the leader of the stellaron hunters is called elio. no one knows who he is or what he looks like -- only that the interastral peace corporation calls him "destiny's slave."
naturally, take your time.
the effects of the anti-truth serum will also wear off. if others mention me to you in the future, you can answer however you like, or even pretend you never knew me.
it's amazing how many songs are stored in its library. someone must have paid big money to get all the copyright issues sorted.
don't worry, mister yang.
well, once a seed is planted, no matter how long it takes, it'll eventually sprout and bear fruit.
it looks like you have not taken my warnings to heart a pity. are you so enchanted by that girl?
while you may have good character, do you have any value? don't take that the wrong way, i'm genuinely asking you. you might have some value, i just don't know about it.
i've given this question much thought, using all the knowledge i've learned from the alchemy commission to answer it. but, deep down, i know there is only one correct answer: there is no difference.
i heard you and mister dan heng went to meet the judges, and then a riot broke out in the shackling prison. i was so worried about you. thank goodness, you both made it out safe.
you probably think i'm being impulsive and unreasonable, right?
i swear on the spirit of chivalry, in front of idrila the beauty, that i will represent master guyun in this duel.
i'm just clearing the stage for the grand entrance -- can't have you three misbehaving in front of the luofu's hotshot general.
nothing but a fantasy. i was not fated for such an existence.
we wouldn't have crossed paths.
so i'll have to trouble you to take a bit of a detour... sincerest apologies.
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
exactly. there must be a reason for this sudden change in her attitude.
sorry, did you have something you wanted to say to me?
he described our world as a fountain. at some point, the sea started to gradually swallow up the land where people lived.
i know you want to help, but we need more intel on the crash site before we start the rescue. there's no time to lose -- let's go.
why, i wouldn't miss it for the world -- seeing as you put so much work into everything.
yes, and no.
i can't remember the last time i went for a walk like this. i never thought i'd take one through such a strange place, with someone i'd only just gotten to know.
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
hook, what's wrong? has someone been bullying you?
nanook the destruction, yaoshi the abundance, terminus the finality i've seen and learned a lot in my time, but i still struggle to understand some of the aeons' actions.
i had a patient who took some before a fight, only to realize that afterwards his lower body was missing
yes, it's this case right here.
aside from saving her daughter, perhaps the helm master was keen to see some front-line action.
however, present-day penacony bears no marks of the stellaron's taint and the family has always been renowned for spreading harmony... how can i be sure your words hold truth?
it makes things easier for the craftsmen. it's not like outsiders can just walk in here.
no, in fact, i should say, she's hiding everything from us.
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
the ipc sure is harsh
another day has passed. if your problem still hasn't been solved, is it possible that the problem is you?
march, before the wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
apologies for interrupting your meeting. my name is jing yuan -- i'm the general of the cloud knights here on the luofu.
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
(a marked change in tone. it sounds like he's quoting from a historical record.)
yes, seeing is believing. i'll accompany you. the dreammaster hasn't shown up yet, so we have some time for a stroll.
how does that song go again? "the place you can't go back to is called home." well, that might sound dramatic, but i really haven't been back home for a long time and frankly, i don't want to.
of course, if there is a day when the underworld doesn't need a doctor like me anymore and everyone lives happily ever after
you're right. something with a mass as huge as a xianzhou ship should keep clear of any planets on its course otherwise, it risks being caught up in the gravitational pull.
you want to stay here? no, no, the artisanship commission isn't safe enough. how about this -- i'll escort you and mister luocha a little further.
rules, societal dos and don'ts, all these made-up human moral codes -- i've given it my all, but i just can't seem to shirk them!
yes, those photos are not just ordinary records of her trips. to miss march, they are dearly precious memories.
no problem, but remember that a debate is like a duel. the more you hesitate, the farther you are from victory.
deploy troops huh. that's not a bad idea.
so where are we headed to now, bronya?
our time on the xianzhou has come to an end. back to the original plan, i suppose?
xiaohan, whenever you are ready. tell us about your plan for aurum alley.
now, your noble status has become a shackle, preventing you from apprehending the murderer and avenging your sister's death. you're feeling anxious because you're out on a limb.
luka, i'm entrusting the chance of attending the wardance on the xianzhou luofu to you.
it wasn't a purchase, but a prize from a monster -- the ferocious fluff ball.
be careful, think twice before you interact with anything in the fragmentum.
i thought so too. it's most likely some rule of penacony's, or the family's.
the express has been commissioned to send a passenger back home. we're just resting up in penacony for a while before we depart.
i'm sorry. i'll be on my way.
catching ghosts is a night job -- it only makes sense to sleep during the day.
as promised, i've delivered the child to you. our transaction is complete.
now that we've got everything we need, we just need to go into a dream. just follow me -- you're about to experience the real fun!
take your time. enjoy the meal and calm yourself.
though the body be immortal, the pain of reincarnation is inescapable.
communicating with others can be a most difficult endeavor. it is through action alone that we can convey our intent faithfully.
technically, she is asking her companion to choose. the record will continue forward even if you don't take any action.
in the meantime i'm gonna figure out how to boost my victory rating. good luck!
i say we bring those two stellaron hunters before diviner fu -- she'll get an answer out of them in no time.
without us, this bird would be too fragile to survive on its own. do you want it to die?
if i get the chance, i'd love to bring my telescope onto the express.
thank you for your generosity, general.
whatever your choice is, i will accept it.
as for that aventurine welt, i'd like to hear your thoughts.
let's go! stay close, you two. cloud knight sushang will guarantee your safety!
losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
i get it. you don't think i have any special skills, so i'll just get in the way?
exactly. i think luocha may have friends on the luofu, and they're using the title page to communicate.
when you were at your wits' end and felt lost about your future, i did everything within my power to help you safeguard your position in the family.
ninja hero? huh, it seems that my trial has finally come to an end
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
i see fine, i respect your choice. let's return to reality.
it turned out that the fire was none other than a heliobus. the remaining fragments of ignamar -- the heliobi -- had found some way to escape from their furnace prison.
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
not at the moment. i'm more interested to know the location of his cornerstone.
if you wanted to refuse, then why would you be standing here right now?
the preceptors have been suppressed for some time now -- they will inevitably try to overturn the situation.
master diviner, you're not the only one who can design a puzzle, and i don't tread the path of destiny alone.
this guitar was one of those inventions. cocolia came up with a name
the dimensions and wear of these two roller components look very different from the rest of the unit. you must have only just replaced them.
can we go with a normal math question?
no, it's just this place seems familiar somehow. never mind.
sounds like we've reached a consensus. now miss acheron?
oleg and i took vache to the overworld. he made his final request to us: to take him outside the city to the snow plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
good! that's smart of you. but you needn't worry, cocolia and i aren't even on speaking terms. it was her that ejected me from the architects -- i refuse to stand with her.
listen: elio can foresee the future, but he can't make decisions for you.
as vast as the universe is, it cannot change its past.
yes, for a puzzle that was designed from the start, choosing any other path would be a pointless mistake.
the materials that mingxi and xiaohan provided were super useful.
we also need to keep a certain distance from the family -- never let them get too close. teaming up with the ipc helps balance that out -- if either side makes a move, we have the option to pull out.
if you feel it's necessary, we'll do what mister svarog suggested but until you're sure, i'll keep trying to find a way to save pascal's emotions and memories
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
the scent where did it go?
breukelen tiernan, razalina jane estella, we raise a toast to you, trailblazers of the silver rail
as for the child who has been with you, he's the innocent protagonist of misha's childhood dream, a friend of clockie, a young apprentice, and a future mechanic on the express
...i've told you everything about my experience with master guyun on kalevala. and now, i'm sure that miss yunli is as moved by the sword's flawless beauty as i was back then.
i heard rumors about this kind of monster "shadows in the fragmentum that assume human forms are echoes of the will of past guardians."
this is no errand, honored guests. i am merely stating what needs to be done, should you wish to help us.
even without the famous galaxy ranger as far as i know, the crew has officially accepted the family's commission, so coming here will be unnecessary for you.
the conditions here are so rudimentary. i wonder how long those people have been living here
all right. drift peacefully off to sleep, and i'll be right with you.
which means seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
my parents are both famous on the yaoqing! i wouldn't be here otherwise. they've been training me ever since i was born!
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market
try not to embellish the facts.
i suppose it probably is. otherwise, it wouldn't be on display here.
i believe you're the kind of person that has the ability and desire to use everything to your advantage but that "everything" does not include miss robin.
you'll know what i mean when you enter a dream. penacony will not disappoint!
without that aventurine stone, you're nothing more than a doomed sigonian thrall sentenced to die by the ipc. or is that serial number on your neck a cherished memento from the amber lord?
goodness! i don't mean to offend i happen to have some medical knowledge, and while observing the flow of your qi, i noticed something unusual about your pulse.
what am i gonna do why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish
hmph, not on my watch.
steady, get ready to counter its attack
i took her in to give her a chance at a normal childhood, not to send her on a sword-hunting journey.
uh you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence
that's not usually like him. i wonder what's going on?
i will. thank you for your invitation.
that's indeed a good idea. while the dreamscape on penacony is all artificial, scalegorge waterscape is a celebration of nature's resurgence. it has some remarkable scenery.
that's the belief of the architects but for us, hell is an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
unfortunately, dan shu is dead, and even her corpse has crumbled into ash. that's one less clue we can pursue.
fortunately, apart from the language module, pascal is still functioning properly
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
you're like a broken record
i've even thought of the design already, but it's a secret! then it'll be a surprise the next time we meet! don't you think so?
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
really? i'm surprised. still, you can rest easy, i won't make things difficult for her.
heh, i think i get it now. in your words, this is called "looting a burning house," right?
if it can deepen your understanding of our trials and tribulations, it will have fulfilled its purpose.
you see, there's not much left for me here except to carry on repairing equipment in the workshop i like practicing the guitar, and performances are fun, but the crowds are pretty small.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape.
anyway, if you must know, the divination commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination.
up ahead is grandpa's study. it was in that room that i saw him the last time.
no, no, i wouldn't bring peppy without letting you guys know first. you have a lot on your plate -- i wouldn't want you to worry about having to take care of him.
being on the same level as screwllum -- who's probably the best in the universe -- is nothing short of spectacular. it's beyond my abilities, computers are not my forte.
march seventh, you're late. here i was thinking you were too chicken to show your face. i was thinking i might have to track you down and settle the score~
wakening which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
we know the essence of your trial of the heart, and we also know that you asked dan heng to help you complete the trial of the mirror.
the answer is... when they are in desperate situations.
you've perhaps read about it in your dreamscape pass, but i can explain one more time!
oh, there was a girl and her brother who said you saved their lives. you might want to check on them and see how they're doing.
we could have a problem. your brother may be there.
i'm just a doctor -- there's not much i can do to assist you. these are medicinal pellets that the alchemy commission hands out to field doctors -- you might find them useful in an emergency. take them.
no need. we hardly lifted a finger. so, the settlement's energy supply problem is solved for the time being?
huh? my synesthesia beacon must not be working because i have no idea what you just said.
i didn't talk to you on the train because i knew you and i would get to talk alone here. worth waiting for, don't you think? you seem to have a lot to ask me.
what do you say? one last time? put our palms together?
you're still talking big but sure, if that happens, i'll stay true to my word.
the person you speak of is sunday, my senior, and one of the local leaders of penacony. he is also the organizer of this era's charmony festival. he heard you all ran into some difficulties, and sent me here to provide aid.
that must be the first step in their mind control process. you were lucky.
what am i gonna do about her? why, wait for the opportunity and send her back together with the rest of them of course, i hey come on, what's with the--
let's leave it at that, shall we? i think we've all had enough rest.
but no matter what their main priorities are, there should always be someone left at the mansion, right?
if i can walk along the streets alone for a few more times, i might be able to conquer my fears of the big city. after all, i'll have to be like igor, competing all over the cosmos for belobog in the future.
why would i dare leave through the main entrance after smashing the aurumatons?
uh-huh. don't worry, i'll take care of any repercussions.
they've been up for a while already. the young guy with the dark hair left first -- he went with sampo.
phantylia had stolen a piece of my life, and a foxian always gets even. i will not be taken advantage of. i must take something back from her as well.
speaking of stories, you've reminded me that now is not the time for them. moze, we've sent the "warning" from stargazer navalia. what's the situation on your end?
i'd be greatly pleased if this apprentice could represent the express in the wardance by displaying their cloud knight flair and prowess.
they brought this upon themselves. the xianzhou alliance forbids anyone from accessing forbidden knowledge regarding immortality.
let's start with pascal. we found him first, after all. also, like mister svarog warned, if he's not supervised, he might cause trouble
still, it's good to have contacts among all this uncertainty. aventurine showed his skills, and as far as our interests are aligned, he can become a reliable ally.
guess you guys had a bad talk, huh? luckily, sampo's got your back!
uh, what's with the red eyes? did something happen?
i didn't find any components, but i got this i don't know if we can still eat it
i'm sorry, i didn't intend to hide this i have to fulfill sam's mission according to the script. that aside there are my personal motives: i wish to get to know this world as firefly.
it appears our otherworldly friend requires some enlightenment. how about this -- the match is starting in an hour. i'll give you some real-life tactical pointers in the ring!
it is an ancient artifact that was planted on the xianzhou luofu by yaoshi, the aeon of abundance. it has the power to shape life and subdue death at will.
you caught on quickly, miss march! that's exactly what i mean.
but i think i failed. maybe there are other things that you guys do?
this arm -- well, it's not that exciting. it's all because i got distracted in a defense campaign. i can't even remember the date of that fight.
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
i wonder how many armories and arsenals there are on each of these planets
it was my mistake to make an unwarranted request without considering your own wishes.
in her, i see the fireflies of the forest, dazzling and bewitching, yet shining only for a brief moment.
so, the intruders and hoolay are holding the yaoqing messengers hostage.
no. usually you just submit your bid and wait for the result.
i heard dan heng mention that before he boarded the express, there was a passenger who looked remarkably like me.
mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
i'm barely able to lift this using both hands. i have no idea how sparkle could ever use this to hit a target
look, miss himeko: i brought the kid back as promised.
is it me or is it cold here?
as a clerk at the hall of karma, my knowledge on these matters is somewhat limited, but i will try my best to satisfy your curiosity. please proceed.
yes, the stellaron the cloud knights are searching for must be causing this anomaly!
the only difference between us is whether we embrace or reject the long life placed upon us by the abundance.
that's why there was a flaw in your dream. in other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
oh, and... take this! a thorough investigation can always use a little more funding. don't mention it!
are you also a member of the family on penacony like him?
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
this is where we ran into the borisin last time. it looks the same as usual.
it's a pleasure to journey alongside you once more. it's time i laid bare the entire truth before you. as you might have heard i also go by another name: stellaron hunter, sam.
beware of the mountain winds in the kandor valley -- they are usually the harbinger of a blizzard. and never, ever stay in the canyon at night.
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
i didn't come here with miss lingsha today to reminisce.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near
oh, man! the phone case shipping location is too far from the space station -- you have to buy five thousand units for them to deliver... wait, please don't tell lady asta that.
haha, this encounter was not of my making. i've been recuperating in the alchemy commission under the dragon lady's care -- our paths have merely crossed
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
knowing that elder huaiyan is part of our last line of defense is a great comfort.
i was worried i might embarrass myself in front of you. i even rehearsed every word beforehand.
thank you for everything you've done for the sky-faring commission and the luofu. this small seal is the foundation of the xianzhou's prosperity.
i am now aware of everyone's stances.
have you talked to oleg about going to see svarog?
i suppose as the head of the security department, he should know.
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
be it mechanical or organic, we're still dealing with composite substances. i just hope you'll tolerate my methods
you may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the yaoqing's warriors.
but i know well that yunli can be impulsive, so if she did steal the sword on a whim, i won't show her any favors.
if i were a family member, i'd find an official excuse and keep the surprise factors here. if we just wait here, that would be like walking into their trap.
you made it i thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
see, there's a piece of paper here! it says "penya sergeyevna"
sorry, please keep still for a moment
haha, but you're fu xuan the seer -- the boundless omniscient! bringing luck and avoiding misfortune is your strong suit, isn't it?
i'll bet, poor you this time we're gonna avenge you! i'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
is he your leader? i feel he possesses a great stillness of mind in everything he does.
yes, i have heard. seeing four leave, yet only three return, was enough for me to know that fu xuan's report was indeed correct.
no, it was for mister gopher wood. he used to stop by the park to people-watch and appreciate the vibrancy of life. this was his way of recharging whenever things wore him out.
you should go and talk to lady bronya, serval. it was her personal invite, after all
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
not sure, pom-pom couldn't put it into words. it's like a gut feeling.
that's why i've come to ask for your help. i don't have enough proof yet, but i'd like to speculate something: the source of all tragedy lies within the family. if you could trust me... we could find the proof to support this claim, together.
does this place ring any bells, misha?
do you know what year it is? who works for money these days? money is a means, not an end. work should make you happy that's the most fundamental principle.
well, honestly, at least you're not as annoying as that woman.
i hate to say it, but if you can teach me that move, i'll maybe admit that you're just a tiny little bit stronger than me
(no need to be hasty, now. you should take a moment to get used to the feeling of being in a dream within a dream.)
the general is always telling me that a drop of water should be repaid with a spring, and that even among friends, etiquette prevails.
are you still continuing down this path? this is a rare opportunity. leaving here will also mean leaving the truth.
the choice is yours, dan heng.
*cough* it was built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa rand, and also
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
besides robin, there was another body. i don't know the exact details, just that it was a stowaway.
i know that... i just never expected to hear you say it.
what's the matter? got too attached to the underground? go ahead, i'll be waiting here.
just get on with the inspection! don't act all chummy with me now that you've got your way.
the extent of the corrosion here is a lot worse than i imagined. misess hinkel did say the clean-up had been slow in places...
if my memory serves me right, the parts this little fella stole were originally designed for that kind of pet upgrade.
so, not only do you think i have a bad temper, but you also think he's ugly?
he mentioned a one hundred twenty-foot sword called star bane that only a giant robot could wield.
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
and, the tuskpir loves "strong" memoria: the more depressed you are, the more happy it'll be. isn't that right, little fella?
i'm working on a major project, i don't have time to squabble with you guys.
as i've said, talk to asta! she's the lead researcher. she's in charge. go, go, go.
a space station, but that's not important.
right, okay, let's get back to work.
yes! the mighty blessing of the reignbow arbiter annihilated all abominations in a single strike! but we had to pay with the blood of hundreds of thousands of soldiers just to halt their advance!
but i threw in something extra regardless. i only did that because we're friends, or i would've charged extra.
it was all a premeditated trap to stir up chaos on the space station!
i would disagree. byari skamandros is not part of the credit system or connected to the silver rail. it's nothing more than a remote civilization sheltered by the harmony but penacony is different.
you've lost, cirrus.
it's very unlikely that the express has joined forces with the stellaron hunters. they are mortal enemies, after all.
i'm surprised the vagrants in the great mine go after the mining teams, they must be desperate.
oh! what's this gadget? this monitor, and this keyboard is it an automaton remote control terminal?
this is no order, honored guests. i am merely stating what needs to be done, should you wish to help us.
the inefficient shipping and low volume of transactions at the aurum alley dock -- which does not create any value at all -- are clear evidence of poor management.
the coast is clear. you can come out now.
anyway, what worries me more are the anomalies within the family. they've summoned followers from various paths for the festival. no matter how generous such a gesture is, this move seems highly unusual.
it looks like there's only one way to gain your trust.
what? how is that possible? i need a moment to wrap my head around this
ah okay.
if what wallace said is right, then norbert must have been missing for several days already. there must be someone who knows where he is.
fifty thousand? well it's a little less than i thought, but not too bad.
phonographs...they use vinyl records, right? there's only a handful of folks on the space station who collect those things.
it's a secret -- and it's a good thing i got here so fast, otherwise you would have missed the fireworks i prepared.
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up
this is how penacony fell under the family's control. since the arrival of the harmony, the land of the exiles has undergone dramatic changes, not all of which have proven beneficial.
i know, right? i'll teach them a lesson myself if i catch them in the act, that's for sure.
*sigh* i was hoping to avoid a conflict with the cloud knights. how about this
how about forgoing the mask design then? a mask with no facial features, a personality with no personality
hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
um it's a pleasure to meet you, mister argenti. i've heard a lot about you they say you're really great i'm pretty good myself too! haha!
strange, why is there no one here?
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
the conflict is difficult, master diviner, but you have led your forces from the front lines and beyond in pursuit of the enemy. admirable work.
nah, i could've taken it on by myself. but still fighting alongside you two was pretty fun.
"you guys have caused me nothing but trouble it's time for you to make amends by proving yourselves in the victory zone!"
her parents were established scholars and adventurers, and she naturally inherited the spirit of the nameless to travel and see the stars. she even has a famous travelogue in her name.
miss fu xuan? is that you?
it's somewhere farther away. they say it's a farewell performance, the kind that's better to listen to from afar than watch it performed live.
this reminds me of one of those building toys. with the blocks? i've never played with them before. i wonder if it's more interesting than stacking chips.
you replaced the damaged components, but the unit isn't starting up as normal. that's what you're trying to figure out, right?
i'm in today. but that is not an excuse for misbehavior.
don't look so worried! i'm not throwing you another mission.
well, even though it's a risky idea, i'm glad you're finally willing to do whatever it takes to win, miss march.
all of you, listen to me -- stop.
very few swordsmiths could use heliobi as forging material, and hanguang was one of them. his attempt came at a terrible cost
once we reach the gate, i hope you'll help me seal it. after that, i'll do everything i can to fight the borisin, and you find a safe place to hide and wait for reinforcements.
i was so sad that my parents decided to take me on a starskiff to see the void song whales. that was the first time i'd ever laid eyes upon them such miraculous creatures.
but there's no point in overthinking things. let's meet up with himeko and the others first.
it's hard to imagine how he managed to suppress his hunger for over seven centuries. will the hostage from the yaoqing be able to avoid being his meal?
alright, well let me issue a warning now: everything from here on out is uncharted territory -- we must proceed with the utmost caution
and this is our final hope. ena's dream is founded upon the harmonious choir, namely everyone's shared wishes. it will only materialize once the aspirations of all beings in penacony merge as one.
alright, i agree. as long as it helps you with your research, you can do whatever you want.
when we confronted kafka, she seemed certain that fu xuan would show up
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
all is well when you have friends coming from afar.
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath "exchange with your precious things."
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
as i said, sister, i will handle this.
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
asta provided financial assistance to a few exceptional children -- i assume arlan was one of them.
i want to use this opportunity to repair the ambrosial arbor's seal and see if i can help recall our memories
and now, with the complicated situation in the alchemy commission, the alliance has spared me a lot of trouble by sending you to handle this challenging task. shouldn't i be thanking you instead?
also, i don't consider you a loner. oh, i don't mean him, but rather behind you
lady bailu has small hands but is very skilled i have to go lie down and have a massage with her every time i return to the luofu.
it appears that the divine foresight is using this wardance as a show of strength to convince everyone that the luofu is prospering after the ambrosial arbor crisis
alas, why is your face turning pale, yanqing?
we'll leave them be svarog may have blocked off the furnace core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. an admirable deed.
when it's time to go, this will be farewell for good. so, before i leave penacony, i'd like to take some time to look back on all the events that have taken place.
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge -- that the truth will spread far and wide: to save the world, we must risk it all.
it's important to slow down and unwind... a change of scenery is sometimes the best medicine.
i know alright, but i can't tell you yet. himeko wants to create a sense of mystery for you and march.
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again
things have come to a close for now. it's good that you came through unscathed.
i was worried this would turn into a heated argument, but it seems like both of you are on the same page, solving each other's problems! i couldn't have asked for a better outcome!
miss asta said that gratitude has to be sincere... it's a shame that i had to finish it up so hastily...
the harmonious choir possesses the power of an emanator. to overcome it, you'll need the same level of power. the final step in destroying the sweet dream... will be my responsibility.
seele, perhaps you can take our outsider friends the rest of the way.
i heard that her old man was furious, and that only a few younger siblings are still in contact with her.
my powers of suggestion are capable of convincing people to accept my orders all without a second thought.
i understand. did she explain her intentions?
he isn't just a boy. instead, he's as ancient as your civilization, and he's the embodiment of jarilo-vi.
she just wanted somewhere uninhabited to experiment with her "life helix system." ruan mei is certainly very talented, but she hardly interacts with anyone. she lives like a hermit. pity.
not at all. taunted by yunli like that, even a training dummy would be angry. you've taught your apprentice well. if it were me in my younger days, i'm afraid i'd have drawn my sword and fought.
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
it's as if the artist has condensed history into one poignant, but sorrowful image. the artist's brushwork depicts a generation's -- no, several generations' hardships
i see so he's just as cunning and crafty as ever
this object has been stored inside helm master yukong's personal trinket all along -- miss qingni lent it to us.
by process of elimination, it seems that only wright could be the murderer. that was easy. let's tell the constable our answer and see what he thinks.
the current guardian is madam cocolia rand. every major strategic decision is issued by her.
but before we leave, i have a question i'd like to ask you, mister yang.
stellaron hunter, silver wolf. we've fought against one another before. herta was there as well -- she may have mentioned it to you.
you don't understand. the one preventing us from getting close to the truth is cocolia herself.
you're with the astral express?
clara seems like the only one who can break through svarog's cold logic. it's a good thing she was here.
cocolia it's been so many years since we last spoke. we were great friends once -- there was nothing we wouldn't share.
huohuo spent a long time in coexistence with a heliobus -- it is likely she became accustomed to that state. with tail now gone, she was relatively defenseless against other heliobi.
oh, no wonder! i was just thinking, there's no way miss march could change her appearance so dramatically in such a short time.
star bane hmm, once i get back i'll talk to the general about it. perhaps he'd be willing to get the artisanship commission involved?
we've been through this. you're the only one i can turn to now.
sky minks fly so nimbly and are so alert that even the quickest of hands will have a hard time catching them.
we're passing through on our way to the alchemy commission at the behest of general jing yuan and diviner fu. we'd like you to show us the way, master gongshu.
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
so you're looking after your brother on your own? that must be hard.
if the family messes with penacony, that would be like declaring war on almost half of the factions in the cosmos. they have no reason to do that.
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
the toy talks?
topaz has something else to take care of, you'll be seeing her later. talks can still continue between the two of us.
but himeko and mister yang told me that qlipoth is far from the only aeon in the universe. for example, the enemies that invaded belobog seven hundred years ago were emanators of a different aeon.
exactly. we don't even have the stellaron's coordinates and location.
i've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near fountain plaza. don't worry, i know my way around the administrative district.
mm, that's all we need to summarize for now. if there's anything else you're not clear on, come and find me.
thanks, but no thanks. i'm a lone wolf, remember?
performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
by following the medicinal fumes, we should be able to retrace the steps of the disguised borisin.
any organization doing something like that is interested in more than just "mutual aid"
the memory zone is constantly shifting its form. looks like we'll have to think of a way to walk on the ceiling.
now that you mention it, i recall that you had a teaching stint back home. any delightful stories that come to mind?
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
even though i truly hoped that the wardance would go ahead uninterrupted and that i was worrying for no reason
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge
i thought this was exactly what you wanted. after all, i faithfully fulfilled my duties as you instructed.
i didn't get a wink of sleep last night.
ahh, that was some ill luck. i got involved in a conflict by accident and ended up owing a favor, so now i have to help send a deceased body back to xianzhou.
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
huh, okay any particular reason?
you'd better hurry up and confront her if you have any questions. don't let her off scot-free, haha.
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
that would suggest that zhongshan is not the murderer.
anyways, the higher-ups didn't say anything. they just got me to come evacuate the civilians in cloudford.
even so, you are lagging far behind the main party. have you not noticed yet? what the family is hiding, the secret behind this sweet dream.
we'll find out, but this is one way to confirm some of our assumptions.
we've lost contact with one of the messengers from the xianzhou yaoqing. the borisin have likely taken him hostage.
miss black swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?
as home draws nearer, so our feelings grow stronger. i can see it in your eyes.
not quite. i only want to ask, how exactly did she become a galaxy ranger?
herta have you ever met her? i'm curious about the tastes of someone who used their own name for a space station.
that pink-haired fox tried to say something. i'm pretty sure he sensed something fishy. since he's not familiar with this place, he just dropped us a hint, but you didn't seem to be paying attention at all.
you're miss seele from wildfire? i came here to
great! that's settled then! the training is on svarog's turf. i heard about your achievements -- you probably know that place like the back of your hand, right?
this little excursion has reached its conclusion -- all things must come to an end. still, some endings spark a new beginning.
anyway, even if you don't find tail, you're still a great judge -- the success of our ghost-hunting squad proves it.
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
don't you think this dream bubble looks really similar to modern-day penacony?
as for personnel the skyports are currently all under maintenance, so we're thinly stretched. what i can do is send tingyun as your guide -- she'll take care of you during your stay.
it took enough time to calm her nerves, it's best i don't disturb her again now.
two hundred seventy-seven thousand eight.
it also contained some information on trials.
so who was piloting the starskiff?
the towns' resources have been swallowed up by the fragmentum. to get anything now, people have to risk their lives!
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
how was it? did you enjoy your time on campus?
with your swordplay skills, you can effortlessly take down ipc mechs, march.
i don't have suggestions, only an opinion, and that is "he's a hopeless workaholic."
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
are you treating general jing yuan as your enemy?
yep. you pick, red or blue?
please rest assured, general. if he dares step foot on the skysplitter, i, yanqing, swear on the blade in my hands that he shall not escape!
i see two bloodhounds they appear to be on official business, unlike the pair from earlier.
okay, enough chit-chat. i reckon the divination commission could be a while -- let's take a look around.
it's fine. let's give this proactive actor one more shot. brave monkey is known for its can-do attitude too.
hmm, i had a similar feeling. almost as if we weren't the only people in the room.
oh, am i hearing right? this little girl is worried about her grandpa! hehe, didn't see that coming.
he wants us to trust him. he took advantage of yukong's frosty reception to play the good guy.
mister argenti, i'm sorry you had to see that spectacle, but please don't underestimate me because of that!
now that that's settled, let's go pay a visit to the museum lobby secretary, eris. she's a talented worker and can tell you everything there is to know about museum matters.
now that you are vanquished at our feet, allow me to recite to you the ninja mantra--
there is something we must take care of before making our next move. as long it remains unresolved, we're at a stalemate. that something is the stellaron.
i can go and find adrian taylor, or the red-nosed old man from epsilon, or even the intelligentsia guild -- at least they won't quit halfway!
wait, you're not silvermane guards? well, why didn't you say so? turns out we're on the same side after all!
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
yes. that incongruous feeling has persisted throughout this long pursuit.
these cloud knights aren't mara-struck what did you do to them?
clearly, professor capote is unlikely to master my speech or mannerisms any time soon... but the content is the key here!
look at that, you did great! this is the proverbial moment of freedom! you've earned it.
since you're both here, let me give you a lesson on gathering roaming data.
my assignment was simply to take you to svarog's lair. i got the payment and delivered the goods -- i wasn't obligated to tell you about my dinner plans!
it's not nice to eavesdrop on conversations.
only by achieving victory in this battle can we secure a future for penacony. and only then, my third and final death won't come true in the most terrible form.
in accordance with the edict of the ten-lords commission, i am hereby authorized to relieve your banishment decree. from this day henceforth, you may come and go freely on the luofu
although, if clara hadn't been here svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
*sigh*, i told you it'd take a while to tell the story -- let's get back to the workshop first. by the way wanna help me pack my bags?
ally? it's a little premature to be talking about that.
sorry... i wanted to show you around, but now i don't think i'll be able to get away...
no one will disturb us now. here, how about i show you a little magic trick?
it appears i was overthinking things. impulsive behavior is pretty characteristic of her after all.
you're a memory zone meme?
that's why i'm standing here right now -- to feel alive, and also for everyone who put their hope and faith in me!
hmm, i'll have to take a good look.
i heard this game isn't just for kids i might have a crack at it myself once i get the time, haha!
i'm trying to find my own room too, and i heard a commotion here... so i came to take a look. luckily your door was open, or it could've gotten dangerous. that man looked like he was up to no good.
missing drones are a bit of a regular occurrence down here. come on, move those legs!
if you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask asta. if she's fine with it, i have no complaints.
there's something wrong with this one
i have another question i hope to have answered.
well, i'd better carry on here, why not have a better look around? my workshop will always be open to you and your wallets, of course.
micah, and residents of dreamflux reef, we raise a toast to you, watchers of the long dream
in most matters, i would say no. but when dealing with heliobi i think the answer is quite clear.
hmm two, three, one, four luocha emerges from the inn, goes to spare time book shop, turns into an alley, then appears at the dock with his luggage
as you were. we must not be tempted into careless judgment. look at their attire. indeed, it is not in the belobog style.
as one of the judges from the interrogation division, i'll be recording your testimony today.
like i said: elio withheld key pieces of information from me. the future holds endless possibilities. knowing the right thing at the wrong time could spoil all our hard work.
well aren't you lucky. as soon as i closed my eyes, i dreamt of endless running and circling and chasing after lady bailu it was even more exhausting than doing it in real life.
i've seen your face before, stellaron hunter, even if it was only on a corporation wanted poster. they were offering quite the bounty dead or alive. do you know the figure?
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
you can call me the memokeeper, black swan.
doesn't sound very interesting.
it is also a lesson i left for her.
do you really believe those living in dreams can escape pain and find true happiness?
after all, the master should be the one who is most aware of their student's strengths and weaknesses.
knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. i should be thanking him.
y'know i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request
never heard of you. now scurry back to wherever you crawled out from.
this is the residual memory from when the 'invitation' was first delivered they were abruptly interrupted. then, what happened next is
oh, so you're familiar with heliobi? that makes this much easier to explain.
we've run into some trouble. your name isn't on the hotel's reservation list
by the way, i've just noticed you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
my, my you look like a small injured animal. are you still willing to talk to me? of course i'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
there's no need to rush to the ring just yet, let's get to know your opponents around here first.
belobog is far from buried in the snow curtain. this city is the planet's last bastion against the ferocity of the eternal freeze.
i'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the memory zone.
general jing yuan, it's my honor to meet you, but i'm not quite sure why you summoned me here to the seat of divine foresight.
it's okay, mister svarog and i can come up with a solution.
as for the mechanism well, if you're interested, i'll explain it to you in detail when we have more time.
trying to change mister svarog's mind on my own would take forever. even if i kept trying until i was all grown up, i don't think i could do it.
she really does tell you everything oh, by the way, i left my goethe hotel limited-edition flask behind last time i was here. let me have a look for it. i think i left it over
yes. she is the memokeeper i mentioned.
the express must plan its routes, maintain its equipment, attend to the daily needs of its passengers, and receive guests, of course
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
no. i will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. memokeepers don't need a dreampool anyway.
people on the express are shocked at the sight of me.
generals, i am finished with my questioning.
judging by where it's docked, it must be heading for central starskiff haven. nice, we'll be safe there.
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
i do not ask for you to pick a side i just wish for you to leave the luofu -- to leave this all behind. this isn't your fight, and i do not wish to make an enemy of you.
i know how you feel, clara. you want new hope for the underground, but you don't want anyone to get hurt in the process, right?
yo, why the exhaustion? you look like the officers over at the realm-keeping commission.
so, do you know what clockwork actually is?
i--it's nothing. you're right, it does belong to me.
this game will be over soon this time, we're going to catch her.
i mean it literally. i sense your burning desire to live, but unfortunately, you don't have anything of equal value to offer.
i took another route to the upper level, and i saw you guys from up there.
as outsiders, you are unfamiliar with the history of the xianzhou. i cannot blame you for asking a question like this. let me tell you a story.
miss jingliu, how long has it been since you last set foot on the luofu?
how about this? i'll stand in for your dear sister at events -- surely you don't want the world to hear the charmony festival's been called off?
let me give you some ipc insider information, my friend. do you know "duke inferno" -- fetora's ifrit?
yes, the entire port now we owe the ipc an arm and a leg.
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
the disciples of sanctus medicus were in hiding for so long now they finally show their face. did the master diviner fail to foresee this?
i'm jiaoqiu, the healer working for the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
it's just that the current express has far fewer cars compared to the past. the passenger cabin only has four rooms -- well, three, technically, since dan heng has been sleeping in the archives.
i don't know if they're worth anything, but they look pretty. here, i think they'd make a nice gift for you.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this
i, gepard landau, captain of the silvermane guards, order you to relinquish your futile resistance.
woah it all looks so complex
phew finally. i think i must have left cadet school with about the same amount
collecting roaming data is a vital aspect, because it's the only way for players to encounter new aether spirits, aside from purchasing or trading them.
phew good thing i let him go alone -- my calming influence would've ruined his training.
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be it doesn't seem to have any info on it
you're one to talk, setting up endless scenarios in the divination commission!
i was worried the silvermane guards might've got to you. but you're not the type to turn someone in at first capture, right?
what huge elixir crucibles. there's still smoke coming out of them.
within the foundation of law, humanity establishes civilization
this jing yuan how much does he know, and how much is he hiding from us?
the university did not escalate matters perhaps it's because mister reca extracted a portion of the people's memories.
hehe, she's talking about that portrait in the elevator room, no? herta commissioned me to design an encryption tool for her -- seems she ended up using it on her portrait.
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is
hmm based on the appearance of the coin alone, it's difficult to discern any significance. as for who it belongs to -- that's also a mystery.
disciples of the hunt? so isn't he the same as xianzhou folks? no matter how dangerous he is, he won't be causing trouble in the land of his fellow disciples, right?
i understand.
the beauty of truth is that it never changes, even when no one understands it. well, that's true for me, at least.
trying to say? i'm not saying anything, i just want to reveal the truth
what is all of this complaining about? you made a promise to my grandfather and now you want to run away? get out there, now!
after the ceremony, argenti carried the sword case, and together with the delegation, they were escorted by the cloud knights to the artisanship commission. the artisan there confirmed that the sword was safely stored.
hmm choose your words wisely, geppie
haha, she's the owner of the express. we joke around calling pom-pom the conductor, but everyone knows himeko is the boss.
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
no can do, mister -- it's way too late. you won't find anyone at starskiff haven. if your friends made it out, then they'll already be in the safe zone. no need to worry, you'll see them when we get there.
i doubt that. i think acai is the only one here still taking orders from people.
oh? it's been a while. did pom-pom call you back?
did velite mention that he was trapped in a dark and enormous cave when we first met?
no, you just have to be clear on what you should do.
i can also reward you as compensation for being my assistant. i will fulfill your every wish.
i'll ask mingxi for some more ideas later. let's go back to yancui's place.
i got the idea early on, chewing on that masked fool's little hint. if a mute isn't "someone who cannot make a sound," then it has to be "someone who cannot speak."
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
i'm sorry if i'd known i wouldn't have got you to come with me. you'd probably be there by now if you'd gone by yourself
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
so you can definitely understand, why we want to be prepared.
"and as the day is almost gone, return alone to water's song, beneath the waves in silver shell, await new life that time will tell."
if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
we must locate it as soon as possible -- ideally before cocolia takes action. can you tell us the way?
huh? oh, uh no need. actually i was just being polite, i don't see why not.
not all incompletions are without remedy. take my ingenium arm, for example -- it doesn't require any invasive surgery and operates by detecting bioelectric signals on my skin.
i wish i could tell you, but i still haven't figured out what it is.
yeah, exactly. he's young and talented.
ah... in that case, i must apologize for my rudeness. do you remember when we first met? i once said you reminded me of an acquaintance.
and that is exactly why i need you with me. you're the only one i can rely on in penacony now.
sorry. i couldn't hear you clearly. could you repeat that?
lady asta! now that's a real lady if i ever saw one. you'll never guess just how wealthy she really is!
if you ask me, after she lost tail, i think her urge to resign became even more apparent.
correct, so we're not going there. i'm taking you to the shackling prison. safe, well-guarded, plenty of food, and a place to sleep.
leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.
that comes to nine million, one hundred eighty thousand
there's no need to blame yourself. this was cirrus's plan all along.
keep your guards up -- we might run into ipc agents ahead.
we've looked everywhere but here i hope my memory is right.
there is no need to apologize. we cloud knights fight on the battlefield, while you judges punish the criminals. we are two sides of the same xianzhou luofu, and it is my honor to serve the ten-lords commission.
i've been waiting a long time for this, hoolay!
we both came from the overworld. maybe that's why we're so eager to turn back the clock -- to return to when life below ground was no harder than life on the surface.
yeah. we're on the xianzhou after all, so we might even find someone who here who knew him! haha!
that i want to go to? my home world, i suppose. sadly, its location doesn't appear on the express' astral chart records, at least the ones that are undamaged.
the merchant guild is making preparations for new developments at the dock, so you can come back once the safety check is all said and done.
we're thankful that you're entrusting this to us -- we'll keep it by the book.
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate
lady asta, i like peppy a lot, so i...
my leg is injured... i'd only slow you down. i'll stay here and shut down the elevator once you've made it to the master control zone.
with thirty-four of this type of painting
a few days ago, i made my interest in you known to herta. my intention is for you to serve as an "assistant." based on our interactions within the simulated universe, i firmly believe you fit the bill.
with elder huaiyan's insight, one wonders how the marshal will react.
regrettably, lady bonajade didn't drop so much as a hint about it.
you are indeed.. dreaming.
so, is it out of goodwill that the astral express volunteered to send her back home?
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
playing the violin and firing a gun both require flexible fingers, but bullets are more obedient.
hmm that would be quite strange, yet such a scenario can't be ruled out.
he accused that galaxy ranger of killing robin without any evidence whatsoever but said nothing about her connection to that memory zone meme, or why he was stalking you.
we'll begin once everyone's ready. the assistant director's camera is ready to roll.
it's only natural to want to escape when strict rules are being forced on you. i know there are a lot of grown-ups trying to control you -- telling you what you can and can't do they're the ones to blame.
well, it's part of my responsibilities as the cauldron master. so, where would you like to start, general?
when the seal was re-established, did you recall anything?
well hang onto it, it's cute.
this is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: weighing your options and making a decision. there are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
don't worry, the hard work is already behind us.
helping others without a second thought -- that is the most important quality of a hero.
the stellaron facilitated the resurrection of the ambrosial arbor
you saw us yesterday, do you remember? madam cocolia received us as honored guests.
ugh let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
that sounds good. we xianzhou people don't make coffins or set up memorials, so i'm sure he would be happy to rest here where life is bustling.
she did the right thing by not trusting us initially -- we were an unknown quantity to her. as for the rush my guess is she's just eager to get us out of her hair and further up the chain.
it's my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.
if you're ever free to visit the space station, please come check in on us. we all miss you.
this is life and death, okay!? you look like you can handle yourself, how come you're so lazy?
in their eyes, we're mere consumables, cannon fodder used to slow down xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
is she creating trouble for you too?
the stellaron hunters have interacted with the ipc, but not the ten stonehearts our paths have never crossed. as for your offer, i can pass it along to my partners, but i have a question
i'll be honest, you guys are hardworking. if everyone from wildfire were as impressive as you on the battlefield, we wouldn't be so hard-pressed by svarog.
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
this must be the result of pascal's meticulous repairs but the little fella doesn't really need the monitor, does he?
don't take svarog as an ordinary robot. he's, uh special.
yes, we only have one last stop.
my audience likes getting to the bottom of mysteries, secrets, and conspiracies we streamers have to cater to that, you know?
i hear that you are very interested in these deep space stones. by way of thanks, i've taken it upon myself to gather some for you.
okay, here we go eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
were i to air such a proposition among you, verily, it would be dismissed in an instant. yet as a knight, it is my duty to aid the express in resolving this issue.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
you don't normally use my full name.
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all that's really weird.
we should make preparations for both approaches. of course, it's better to settle matters through peaceful means. but if the situation changes, we must be prepared for armed conflict at a moment's notice.
ugh you're so annoying
but from his point of view, we're no different from all the other tourists who may leave at any time.
master, are these creations truly able to protect the artisanship commission? there's already been so much destruction -- why haven't we seen any in action?
yes, i better think about aventurine's proposal.
hmm this area is sheltered and facing the sun, plus it's flat ground, but
hey, enough pessimism! back in my "official capacity" days, i spent a lot of time in the north -- i got to know the soldiers and officers on the front line very well.
i just want to take a look at the weapons and talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
what fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet? i sincerely look forward to them.
the devil of soulglad... care to elaborate?
you have no idea how difficult these people are to deal with. put it this way -- they've hushed up the existence of "death" before, so they can definitely cover up any news about robin's death.
the intelligentsia guild is always able to find a way to support their case, writing enough "scholarship" in one night to fill a library this is a problem.
we were taking a walk in the park like any other day when he suddenly hit on the idea to have me manage the park. within the domain he demarcated, my every word would hold the force of law.
miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
no, it isn't them.
haha, so you've noticed. well, we're hardly strangers, better to skip the formalities, right?
if we want to find it, maybe we should ask some luofu locals.
a long time ago, i also spent some time studying at paperfold university. so, i can be considered an alumnus of the school.
exactly, but ironically, people don't think there's anything wrong with it, because they uphold the illusory notion of self-value, and even the weak believe in it.
swords are more honest than words. it's much easier to judge a sword than to judge someone's words, so i rarely make mistakes.
i've never met anyone who was willing to talk. i could only stand at the crossroads, watching crowds of people hurrying like the wind through the jungle of steel, only to deposit the alfalfa credits that they'd earned into the bank's vault.
not good -- looks like the crash disturbed monsters in the area. we need to get there -- fast.
i said why not?
the jepella palace crumbled in the scorching flames, and ifrit's power has grown by the day ever since. would you believe it to be merely a coincidence?
only thing though is, i can't make the call. i'll need to write a report and discuss it with bronya, pela, and others first.
i gotta say i'm a little upset at the thought of you choosing a toddler over your old buddy sampo
if you're not too tired, gepard, can i talk to you for a moment?
i understand, but i'm afraid it won't be an easy task.
in both cases, tales have a predetermined ending -- but you shouldn't let that stop you from enjoying them, should you?
did the preceptors truly believe that nobody knew of their scheme?
hmm everyone's talking about this "seawater magma" flavored snack -- it's becoming all the rage on quite a few planets. i've heard they extract seawater and combine it with magma from the mountains.
"come to clock studios theme park to learn more about the history of the planet of festivities!" i think the general will like this gift.
i should have gotten involved earlier, but i was tied up with other responsibilities. my apologies for letting you take on the investigation without proper support.
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
(why is the monster talking now?)
i hope serval's right that supreme lunatic better not have harmed bronya.
what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
there were a few researchers who didn't make it...
...apologies, this one-armed knight's passing has left me somewhat distraught.
i am not fond of this idea.
quickly, over here, miss march. this is a "reverse mentorship gift" from me to you. i hope you put it to good use.
use that will of yours to reach the end of your story. that's the you i like.
don't worry -- the express received a normal invitation this time. it's from penacony's "paperfold university".
but things have changed -- your arrival constitutes an "external variable" for svarog. i may not have the full picture, but perhaps you guys have an opportunity to sway him.
i've come to see myself clearly in this dream journey. perhaps it's what people call a blessing in disguise.
i know jiaoqiu always wants me to know my limits and not get carried away, but now is the time to bring this to a swift end.
in moments of stress, do you ever ask yourself -- which of my actions truly serve my own interests?
if the family asks, just tell them that the express is investigating the stellaron hunters -- i'm sure they'll understand. we'll plan our next move according to how they react.
i was just talking with dan heng, but he never seems very interested in chatting.
six nightingales facing in different directions -- an obvious hint.
do not worry. you will hear my shout: "idrila, the beauty, is the most peerless beauty of them all!"
in the entire alliance, huaiyan is the most inscrutable of the generals. i've worked with him on more than a few occasions, but i can never seem to figure him out.
straight to the point, huh? i like your style.
you're confident you will be able to get out of this in one piece.
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons
firstly, your trial of the heart! you went to professor capote and asked him to simulate conversations with you so you could better understand your boss.
i should have stayed here and waited for you, but when reality and memories merged, i unconsciously pushed open that door and left the bubble with clockie.
nothing escapes your attention, miss navigator.
i've compiled the details into a written analysis. if you're interested, feel free to take a look.
perhaps. judging from the appearance, much of the architecture in this prison has a vidyadharan style so perhaps they did have a hand in building this place back then.
think pom-pom will like it?
the book glimpses into the beyond describes it as "living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown."
during the fyxestroll garden incident, my sister gave the order to seek reinforcements. it was thanks to your support in that critical moment that we were able to get the situation under control. i wanted to thank you.
my master and seele both think that i talk too much. never thought i'd run into someone chattier than me hahaha!
he almost didn't make it -- he was unconscious for two or three days. i sat next to his bed, anxious and guilty. guess what he said to me after he woke up?
hey, you came. that was fast.
i give her the most boring things, and then she gives them back to me and they're suddenly interesting.
i heard the wardance is about to be held in the mortal world. i remember watching a sword duel at the wardance with my sister when we were young.
for my brother, orders are more important than anything. even if you stuck bronya's letter to his forehead, he wouldn't be swayed.
how lamentable you are! please, bear with me for now. i vow to defeat evil ninja osaru and restore your ninja forms.
we solve a puzzle one piece at a time. let's get some rest. we'll talk to wildfire tomorrow and get to the bottom of this.
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
it's undeniable, being without a physical body has its perks, but when moving through the world in the form of a memetic entity, the danger of forsaking one's "self" becomes apparent.
hearty combat and exciting adventures not bad, i certainly don't hate it.
himeko messaged me -- the express detected the jade gate's re-opening. she asked whether we'd be heading back any time soon.
however, she lived for a mere twenty-nine days on the human calendar. such a pity.
they follow miss mirror's orders and handle all sorts of jobs on the ship. they're the best sailors.
dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
you see? brothers and sisters need to have a scrap once in a while to get back on good terms.
i would also extend my sincere thanks to you, general of the luofu. the presence of everyone here assures that the talks will likely reach a conclusion that satisfies all sides.
sometimes, even an old-timer like me feels like taking the stage and making a fool out of myself.
there was a man from my homeland who, at a time when the world was grappling with deep, unhealable pain, made a choice.
if you wanna make sure you don't burn yourself out or stifle your creativity, then don't push yourself too hard at work~
question: are we introducing a fifth partner for the simulated universe?
looks like fifteen days are too short to master swordplay.
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
umm, that depends on the higher-ups. if there are still civilians to evacuate, then i'll need to come back.
my real name is guinevere, but a xianzhou friend came up with an authentic xianzhou name based on the pronunciation.
i don't want to disturb him. this installation was accidentally damaged by two of the vagrants. if mister svarog finds out, they'll get in big trouble
there should be some time until the next warp jump, so feel free to walk around and familiarize yourself with the environment.
once the express is safely out, i will devise my own exit plan and navigate my way to safety. until next time!
that didn't seem like a perfect goodbye.
go straight until starwatcher avenue, keep to the right, and you'll see a storyteller performing on your way. that's where the sleepless earl is.
business hours aren't over yet, she should be nearby. you two go ahead, i'll wait here in case she comes back.
just as i expected. so, is diamond planning to demote me, or kick me out of the ten stonehearts?
as for now, i'm temporarily suspending the activities of the ghost-hunting squad.
"they used the planetary rings to establish the law, forging a code of conduct among the masses."
yanqing, the wolf you are hunting is standing above us in the wardance ring at this very moment, facing the cloud knights
hah. what an alliance joke.
their tea must be stronger than himeko's coffee
at the fight club i heard people say that the guards withdrew from the underground many years ago, and that it was the supreme guardian who gave the order.
what kind of question is that!? i'm your old pal -- sampo koski -- we've been through thick and thin together!
they are an army ruled by the aeon of destruction, nanook.
i shall find a way to escape. it matters not if my flesh is pierced by the insect's horns. the closer i get to death, the closer i may get to the path of the beauty.
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
she looks so young. she was already famous in the last amber era, no? she has to be at least a hundred years old.
oh, looks like one of my colleagues is after me. my apologies, but i should probably take this. bye!
it's a little bit forced, but it's fine. so who is this mister sampo, then?
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
she mentioned that this transaction involves the watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
without that pinball machine, neither one of us is going anywhere anytime soon.
based on what you said, even if i should wake up, these wounds that caused my death will remain on my body and never heal?
thanks to both your help, everything went smoother than i expected. and it looks like we still have some time to spare.
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
well, it seems you're struggling to think outside the box. sometimes, weakening your opponent is just as effective as improving your own combat skills. it's all about innovation.
look around you, do you remember anything?
the sorting and analysis room has been sealed off. we can't go this way.
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too and, who is that over there?
anyone who qualifies for the "ringmaster's challenge" is a respectable warrior.
at this point, i'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
the past and the future are so similar to each other. i'm indifferent towards them.
perhaps it's an antiquity left behind by some past interstellar traveler.
but there is a type of dream that we will never awaken from, and should never awaken from
i've only ever seen this quality in mister svarog
all in black, surely they're not ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
i don't hear any objections.
or my fondness. i want to tell her that i love all her songs.
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
i doubt the underground will ever see it fully excavated
that's the claim the family makes. whether they were truly unaware of all this is a delicate matter.
but if you ask for my opinion, it's better to be safe than sorry.
could it have malfunctioned? it appears to be normal
three, two, one what's the word again?
speaking of attracting attention how do we get a following on a paranormal activity website? sounds like little gui's department -- she used me in some of her performances just to draw a bigger crowd.
now that dan heng has arrived, the elders see yet another chance -- how could they let it go?
that was really risky behavior! if those grownups had woken up, things could have gotten really dangerous for you two.
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
just listen to your gut -- you were the one who said that... the remembrance doesn't lie.
well, in that case there is little i can do.
fortress? i like this metaphor. i had dealt with the warlords of the iymanika star system not long ago, and their synchronized orbital manor wasn't this heavily guarded.
but i can tell by the look on your faces you're probably not dropping by to say hi.
i initiated the simulation flow. this is just a record of the past -- she's not actually talking to you.
please accept these gifts as thanks for saving my daughter. i'd heard that the nameless had traversed the starry sea, but i wasn't prepared for how much i could learn from you.
the mastermind behind this incident would fully support your opinion presumably.
hand over hoolay's remains to the xianzhou yaoqing, and i'll handle the explanations to the alliance.
ix never gives anyone so much as a first glance, and that's perfectly normal. what reason would they have to bequeath strength unto mortals?
foreboding signs can also be superficial. you may have good fortune after riding out the storm.
does that bother you? i believe we will be able to be frank with each other, but that needs time.
i'm afraid this is nothing, benefactor
come on, accidents happen! i'll have them rounded up in no time.
wait, gepard! listen to me--
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
jackie, can you hear me? i need you to call the chairman for me
perhaps i simply attract problems i thought i would be safe at the luofu, but now
don't worry, i'll explain all the details to you later.
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
hehe, that's our seele. nothing if not punctual. so, did you find any usable supplies?
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
i already picked up a few gifts earlier, so that means there's only three more left to go. but we've already lost a lot of time, so we'd better not drag our feet
now, let's proceed upward!
yes, it's for you... just take it.
it's all right. there's no cure for such a symptom.
every silvermane guard here, every person here, is ready to sacrifice themselves, ready to spill their blood for belobog at a moment's notice
they're plotting to overthrow the architects and bring harm to the city.
it doesn't matter, my friend. what matters is that we're now acquainted!
the payment for the dock is ready now. if you're ready for the next round of negotiations, come and see me at the dock.
the actions and desires of the nameless are always sincere. when dealing with you, the same sincerity is the most fitting price.
that's him if the legends are true, then he was a man who created an aeon.
i like your analogy very much. indeed, birds are born to fly, but in a distant past, their ancestors could only gaze at the sky in envy.
you're a top-notch boxer, just like i'm a top-notch swordsman. the outcome of this match isn't going to change that.
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
penya sergeyevna was belobog's greatest outdoor explorer -- passed away sixteen years ago.
strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here
as for miss march she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
it's a unique train that can travel between the stars with the power of the trailblaze aeon.
objects that fell from the blue on separate worlds. their appearance spelled disaster. many of the planets we've visited have suffered their effects.
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
no need to be humble, you took great risks for the xianzhou. i saw what you did.
i believe in your potential. it is rare for someone to have such a carefree, optimistic disposition.
"campus" that word sure brings back a lot of memories.
his injuries weren't that severe but well, he'll still need some more time to rest.
(monster lairs and black market spaces i doubt the luofu has any of that. at least, i doubt things of that nature existed before the ambrosial arbor's resurrection.)
it seems that the supreme guardian holds you in high regard. i have received orders that your movements are no longer to be restricted.
oh, stop playing dumb! didn't you slip this into my pocket?
sure sounds like it. i could only dream of having a cozy job like that.
that's quick thinking, and very sound logic. aventurine is no fool. and working with him definitely has its dangers.
it's been a while, my astral express friends.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land must have been real too, right?
whoa she sounds like a big deal.
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
ratio, you should come in and take a look. the view here is breathtaking. honestly, you could easily squash me with just a pinch.
just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
and with my last breath, i'll join the weak in reaching my hands toward the sky.
are you implying that the insect imparted you with a message prior to its demise?
if i can walk along the streets alone a few more times, i might be able to conquer my fear of the big city this place scared the heck out of me when i first got here.
don't worry, i'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
one thing i will ask -- please try not to embarrass him too much, okay? he's the fighting champion of boulder town, after all -- an idol for all the children. he needs to keep up that image, haha.
general jing yuan tasked the master diviner with commanding the cloud knights -- he would've known she'd act on the results of her divination.
failure is always the best teacher. to save more lives, you must first understand what they live for and what they die for. the best way to achieve this is through personal experience.
it means the tree was as tall as the sky and stars hung from its branches.
recover those cherished recollections and enshrine them in a land of purity. in doing so, all will be preserved from true oblivion.
if we could launch our automatons into space like satellites, it'd definitely give us an edge in combat.
the power that men both fear and desire is right in the palms of your hands...
letting her go was the right decision -- further observations are needed before we decide whether to trust her. but first, there's someone i need to talk to.
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
if you have a target in mind, let's go investigate.
oh, like how things look big when they get closer? i get that!
arlan from the security department lost contact in the vicinity. i need to find him first.
"mecha" what an intriguing statement. i recall the bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal -- "a tall male in silver armor."
despite her vow to hunt down and wipe out all cursed swords, fulfilling that vow requires immense effort. traversing the starry seas in search of the swords is like finding a needle in a haystack.
the final step in this training -- is to challenge boss svarog!
okay, i'm done asking.
a duty-bound soldier and a resistance leader it's hard to be rock 'n' roll in front of people like that.
i'm just curious -- now things have come to this, is the family still unwilling to fight? i mean, your darling sister's already a goner, right?
hmm so are we here to commemorate your short-life species friend?
now that dan feng's reincarnation has shown a command over the vast marine expanse of lunarescent depths, those longing to keep the traditional bequeathal of the high elder feel increasingly uneasy.
after we got to know each other by sparring, i realized that he was indeed a kind gentleman, but it was a little hard to understand him and his "sword" was hard to understand, too
thank you, miss march. you really are a hero.
i'd like to see us try, haha they're extremely heavy. even with all of us, we wouldn't be able to move one.
i would ask -- would you still embark on this journey?
but to be honest, i'm not very close to him. after all, he's an officer and i'm the opposite.
mister reca is so amazing. he convinced the family so easily.
not that long ago but i've been receiving strict cloud knight military training since i was a child!
besides, after our argument today, you want me to go back and talk to him now? no way, at least not today. maybe tomorrow
the crew members' rooms
haha, don't misunderstand me. the xianzhou does not engage in torture. retrieving intel does not necessarily involve the use of violence.
huh? the general is such a busy man. i can't believe he's coming to watch a nobody like me in action
as i suspected, this chip aventurine gave to you is actually a miniature transmitter.
hm it's a place too cold to bear, covered in snow and ice. the guys doing the scientific research don't have time to worry about the surroundings.
of five people, three must pay a price.
we received an assignment from general jing yuan to arrest the stellaron hunter. thank you, diviner, for coming to our aid, but we must escort the fugitive to the general.
hey, silent but deadly, shout if you see any danger, okay? don't think just because you know a move or two you can charge off by yourself!
and there he goes again i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
you're so direct -- i like that!
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there)
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
mm-hmm! so, you are gonna let us in now? we need to talk to mister norbert about some important business-related matters.
i come from an alliance, and was born on a grand and beautiful ship that i barely had the chance to see i can never return.
let's go and take a look at the classes, shall we?
well let's see. ah, yes -- a silvermane guard standard issue portable heater. i--it's broken, though.
yes, when the dust settles, i'll just think of a way to recall it in the memory zone.
as i mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." still, look at it this way: just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
in addition to visitor recognition systems, i've made a few notes on third-party signal monitoring and emergency response devices.
ah, speaking of which, miss eris was just looking for you -- why don't you go to the museum and talk to her?
have faith in a professional director's judgment. have your scripts ready, actors! show the bananadvisor what you're capable of.
in this universe, there exist countless worlds that are similar yet different, and countless people who are alike yet distinct.
my first impression was that she was the daughter of a rich family -- owners of a big company.
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst?
maybe qingque actually knew igor, but forgot about him.
what, is he famous on the luofu or something? not even the cloud knights on the zhuming, who all know my glorious name, might recognize my face.
a "spectacular" view? hah! did you hear that, jing yuan? this person is being sarcastic.
well the express has some dealings with madam herta, so we come to visit the space station from time to time.
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
once there are sufficient records in the data bank, the flow of individuals will link together seemingly independent events.
even though i don't understand politics, i know that cauldron master lingsha's job is quite difficult. the general also told me to do my best to assist her in re-organizing the alchemy commission.
the master diviner must have launched the campaign while we were delayed in the artisanship commission.
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
that's not true, guyun. that nameless swordmaster shaped his own destiny, so you can too.
"my apologies for the delay, march seventh."
no need. you have your own duties to take care of. i'll be fine by myself.
at present, kafka has no intention of speaking and the stellaron hunters' motives remain unknown. we must rely on the power of the divination commission to unearth the truth.
miss bailu, she's here for a consultation.
don't take it to heart, march. miss fu xuan seems like a reasonable lady -- i'm sure she's not angry with you.
during our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by mister sunday
i'll see you next time -- you'll invite me back, right?
a concrete object can indeed help the memokeeper establish a connection with you but boothill, if you have more back-up plans in the future, i hope you'll let me know in advance.
yes, i've been preparing myself mentally for a long time. if i back out now, it'll be a huge loss.
thanks so much. i would have helped her myself, but i've been drowning in paperwork in preparation for the bidding.
need i repeat myself again? i'm a healer.
no offense, miss carmella, but i'm not keen on the ipc. they nearly turned my home into an asset that could be bundled and sold.
mister luka, come take a look. this is the tuskpir treatment that i've prepared for you.
i hope you've regained a little composure. we'll move out when you're ready.
as you know, my sister used to be one of the research team leads in the silvermane guards technology division. stellarons were her main area of research.
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea.
it's an ore -- a special energy resource. whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on geomarrow.
is this the right way? it looks like there's a roadblock up ahead.
it may also be that miss firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
in the midst of the conflict, the eternal freeze descended without warning. suddenly, sweeping winds brought blizzards which buried the invading legion. belobog was all that remained.
and you believe that someone like her would have an ulterior motive for impersonating a galaxy ranger?
miss sushang here is a member of the cloud knights. you can try asking her.
looks like we're the only ones in good spirits today
did he succeed?
they've always liked shiny things -- gold coins, gems, you name it. they're like a big fat investment account accruing interest guess i should've just named them "piggy."
the situation is unclear. something must have happened on the planet of festivities, but the public is unaware of it. someone in a position of power within the family must be covering it up.
i worry about her wandering around on her own, and i want to know what's been on her mind lately.
how impressive! that's quite a fancy way of saying "i haven't learned anything so far."
sometimes i stand at the door of the clinic and watch her running and jumping around and my tiredness simply goes away.
it's been over a decade since the silvermane guards withdrew from the underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. the only contact we have is the exchange of geomarrow for goods.
thanks to captain gepard, we managed to keep our losses to a minimum. i'm sure people will begin to appreciate the silvermane guards after this battle.
but still behaving within your calculations, no?
ahaha -- ahem! i would recommend you not recite your story to everyone you meet. miss seele won't understand it anyway, so let's save it for the chief, huh?
she's used to doing research alone in the snow plains, and we've always believed she can protect herself, but this is different i'm worried she could run into bad people.
looks like i'm quite famous on the xianzhou luofu, too.
most undergrounders are miners, and this is what they mine for a living. y'know, if we didn't have geomarrow to burn, this world would have frozen to death long ago.
if the shipping passages in cloudford changed even a little, the entire route would be drastically altered.
sacrosanct. it means this place is important.
so i was right. these models have interiors that look exactly like the real buildings. the only difference is that no one lives in them.
the thief has stolen parts again? how am i going to track down this crook?
if kafka was holding an umbrella, that means she was in an area with artificial rainfall during the transmission.
until we're back in the overworld, i propose a temporary truce and cooperation. your true intentions are of interest to me
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
report the losses to general jing yuan and find someone from the divination commission. they can't just stand there watching while we deal with this mess
and now, i propose a toast
master diviner, do i have to come
your powers of perception are impressive -- no matter how well a treasure chest is hidden, you're always able to spot it i think you're the right person for the job.
things are much more serious this time for two days now, huge clashes have been breaking out between the miners and the vagrants. it isn't pretty.
what!? come on, the overground and underground have been sealed off from each other for over ten years. it would've been news if a silvermane guard had come down here, let alone an overworld princess.
there's been a lot of buzz lately about an "elite player" who's been making waves in the gaming community -- i want to discuss the situation with mister giovanni.
make a choice, bear it, reflect on it, and accept it. there's no need to prove anything or seek validation.
i still can't believe it. the whole report reads like a bad joke -- it's simply unimaginable.
now he guards the furnace core hub. many vagrants have established bases in the vicinity, seeking svarog's protection.
he's been lost in thought since he came aboard
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
the xianzhou possesses extremely advanced technology. if i'm not mistaken, we've been in an artificial ecosphere since we arrived at the skyport.
that's easy for my grandfather to say, but this mission doesn't seem so simple anymore.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
please listen and don't interrupt her. we may be able to find out more of what we need to know.
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later
i won't do anything crazy. i just want to wander around and see more of the world for myself. i want to buy some oak cake rolls. i've had a cake roll every day since i arrived in penacony, from the first day to the last.
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
perhaps making the attractions no longer just attractions is another corrective measure?
emphasizing your most respectable status to demonstrate your personal worth. very astute.
my superiors have granted me the approval i need.
i can't believe you ended up back here on the skysplitter after running around all over the place. but, you're too late to enter the tournament now.
this fortress is also the residence of the supreme guardian.
here, this medicine is named "yabruh." a tiny dose can numb the body's senses and alleviate any sensation of pain.
thanks to the "favor" of the lord ravager, i've become a player in this game.
all of you -- focus on destroying the phantom flowers -- i'll go for the body.
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person
oh? and what do you have in mind, detective? fieldwork?
we had heard nothing of the express for a long time. it is heartening to learn of its continued journey along that starward track.
now's not the time for jokes.
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time train or no train.
mister paavo, i wonder if that hero ever left a name in your history?
making a mess wherever you go i should have disbanded this "support squad" months ago.
she's a criminal. that's up to the cloud knights and the ten-lords commission.
i'm good at documenting information and coming up with my analysis. acting on that analysis is the captain's job.
to the docks. don't worry, you'll be safe.
why do you insist on becoming a pilot!? i don't understand.
cooperate? what makes you think i'd cooperate with you?
not so fast, you little brat. according to the ipc regulations, i have the right to arm myself and protect the property on my transport ship.
i can understand that for you, this is an extremely difficult decision, because you, and you alone will bear the fate of all belobogians.
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
so, you're saying someone deliberately cleared the place out?
what if i feel like giving up? what happens then?
i think about this every time i listen to diviner fu talk. we are both from xianzhou, but are we really speaking the same language?
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
master heard about a spectacular view in scalegorge waterscape. i believe she went there to enjoy it.
nous or no nous, my contributions remain invaluable.
elder, look around you. you've long since reincarnated. what remains here are just the mirages of the waters of the ancient sea.
i think i understand. we are in the belly of the beast.
greetings. we're the nameless from the astral express, and we'd like to check in.
come on stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
but i'm still not quite clear, what are the rules for this popularity revival match?
miss, why didn't you just do this earlier?
to be honest, it does nothing to benefit the ipc... but it is extremely beneficial to the long-term development of the entire universe.
what happened to that confidence of yours?
my advice to you is to visit the shopkeeper mister xiao. he is the one who proposed the reorganization of the merchant guild. if you can get his support, you will definitely receive support from the other merchants.
it's good that you think so. someone with that mindset and the actions to back it up -- that is the true meaning of the word "hero."
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
general jing yuan believes in this prophecy too, as mentioned in the report. i'm curious why you didn't question it at all?
hahaha, here's the galactic baseballer -- the paragon of both heroism and humility!
i was exiled from the xianzhou. i am no longer one of the scions of permanence.
that's out of the question. i won't back down, just like how i faced your gun last time.
i understand your concern. if the individual in question did indeed try to hack into herta's office, then the simulated universe is undoubtedly her next target.
even if you managed to set hoolay free, you'd have no way to escape.
well then, were you satisfied with this simulated universe journey
if i win, you will allow master guyun to leave the xianzhou with me. and if you best me, miss yunli, i'll accept my defeat and turn master guyun over to you...
but if you are using lies to mask your true intentions, using my sister and bronya for your own ends i swear by qlipoth that i will carry out your punishment without an ounce of mercy.
at least, that's my theory. still, that doesn't explain why pascal is being treated as a fragmentum creature
the next stop, to pave the way for the future that is written.
that certainly isn't our area of strength.
the karma of past lives chains the world of the present
i was actually once an officer of the silvermane guards. after being discharged due to an injury, i followed my old lady here to the underworld, where i planned to retire.
i i've been instructed to keep it quiet.
i've probably got a thirty% chance, or less.
hey did you just scare off a fragmentum monster?
don't worry, it should be gone by now -- inquisition spirits only ask one question at a time. it will go elsewhere once it gets an answer.
i heard that they found an antimatter legion bomb, and the entire luofu needs to be locked down for safety's sake. they'll only re-open after they've removed the bomb i don't know if that's true.
the current supreme guardian is a liar who uses sweet words to deceive the underworld. she's never cared about our survival--
that door over there is the only way out we'd better close it
for real? hmph, never mind the gift i got for you then
don't be surprised. my job is just to help everyone make the right calls.
i wonder if the dying words of those ugly menaces can be trusted. as the saying goes: "even an insect speaks kind words when death is near."
*sigh* i've had a lot of free time recently, so i was thinking about writing some new songs. sadly, that's about as far as i got
as time went on, new exhibits were continually added to the memorial until it became the museum we see today.
she thought it might be a way to find out more about madam yukong's past, and why she no longer flies.
i'm curious. why did you become a nameless?
if we can reach some sort of agreement with old oti beforehand and gauge our opponent's boundaries, our future negotiations will go much more smoothly. that's the obvious benefit.
i want to give you something more practical and realistic, something that can really help you. so, it may be different from how you imagined
after this match, i'll be up against yanqing in the "ringmaster's challenge".
this time around, there were no successful bids for him.
thank you for stepping in to resolve this matter, but are you sure about the rooms? i wouldn't want your other guests to feel we were being given preferential treatment
you'd think in a place as isolated as belobog, people would be more willing to share what they have. well, it's the exact opposite. and i'm more than happy to make up the shortfall.
continue, memokeeper. this destination of which you speak, what sort of world is it?
sounds like something the hero of belobog would say alright.
game on -- show me what you're made of!
not long ago, himeko showed me her collection. there was something called a "satellite" -- i was very intrigued.
time for your second test. i'll be your examiner this time, and i'll be testing your ability to defeat enemies with unconventional moves.
these floating shadows are called mirage echoes. they are memories of past lives and echoes from the past that the vidyadhara shed during their rebirth.
miss serval is cool, strong, and carefree
if we lose the people, we lose the reason for our existence. our fight with the fragmentum monsters is for the sake of preservation, but our fight with you i fail to see the purpose.
indeed. since general jing yuan tasked the master diviner with commanding the cloud knights, he must've known she'd act on the results of her divination.
no need to thank me, just a cloud knight doing her job!
...long ago, i, too, was like you, with irreplaceable companions. we also embarked on journeys, making the best choices we could whenever we could.
if his disappearance is also related to the case here, then maybe he really did stumble upon something important.
you don't seem to have heard of him before... he belongs to the annihilation gang, so i guess it's normal. then let me explain to you...
looks like we understand each other.
you know what? this isn't my first time dealing with the sky-faring commission, i can handle your unreasonable ways.
defeat my army, and i'll give you the rematch you seek. my word holds true.
are you planning on staying on the luofu? the banishment decree has been revoked, and the preceptors have regained an awareness of the situation. this is your chance to return to your homeland.
for me, the truth or lack thereof is not what matters in this game
uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy
you've probably met him before, right? yep, it's that boy with the mechanical arm. he was also doing work for wildfire before, just not in this town.
so, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
i believe he came to me to complete the trial of the mirror.
that's such a shame! i absolutely adore little animals! have you guys met numby yet? i guess they're off playing somewhere.
when a distorted afterecho manifests to correct us, i'll be able to pinpoint its whereabouts.
xiaohan is the ipc's operation rep in exalting sanctum.
just like today -- would it have mattered if "baique" had brought you here instead of qingque? it makes no difference at all.
how's it going, partner? is that feeling in your chest the thrill of victory or just the joy of making it out alive?
recently, i learned something new calculation results can't always bring people happiness.
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
i'd like to invite all of you, as witnesses to this war, to a soul-soothing ceremony hosted by the sky-faring commission. will you consider?
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
and yes, things are going well for me too -- thanks for asking!
there's no other grand theater in the dreamscape.
he's still on duty. huh, he must have recovered quickly.
huh it's just, there are less painkillers than i'd expected. did someone break into the storage room?
okay i need some time to emotionally prepare myself anyway.
besides, my problem with him wasn't that he was a strict father
are you just calling to poke fun at me?
the hacker was skillful and even taunted us with her seal. her name is silver wolf, a member of the stellaron hunters
a box in a box, that's how you know the gift is sincere!
now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
ah, you're back. from the sound of your stride, i sense you're in good spirits.
somebody used the cloudford control panel to block the road with containers.
there are so many silvermane guards on patrol. is it usually like this?
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
it's a shame that i forgot to ask her for her name. i only know that she's from the garden of recollection.
i should get back to work. we we'll have another chance to meet, won't we?
uh the portion sizes on the express are too small! things were pretty scarce in the underworld, but the food stall owners were never this stingy.
which means that you, svarog -- uh you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld for the time being.
if we catch lady bailu, will luxie really follow her into our trap? do heliobi really have a sense of loyalty to their victims?
your opponent this time is similar to the ipc mechs. unsheathe your swords and give it everything you've got!
there's a monster in the area. we'll need to deal with it first.
huh? so that's why nothing's going back to normal! c'mon, we need to hurry.
the cocolia i knew would sit on the roof and listen to my songs, but not the supreme guardian.
hehe, come on, it isn't that difficult.
now i see why she holds you in such high regard!
someone's full of energy! you don't look like a xianzh--
here we are again. what kind of song are you in the mood for now?
that this is but another one of doctor primitive's experiments. as for you, actor rappa, you were already infected with another memetic virus.
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
i can't remember anything.
but there's no need to worry. they won't be able to attend. do you know why?
okay, the stage is yours~
mmm it's the prelude. can you hear it?
so if the topics i chose interest him why is he still like that?
wildfire wants everyone to leave the underground but mister svarog wants everyone to stay here. according to his calculations, the overground is already unsafe.
i heard that miss yunli was a great swordmaster, so i thought she'd be a good sparring partner, but she's always eyeing my sword, so i better be careful.
this message is a threat. the hidden map that silver wolf mentioned is probably the sealed dreamscape hotel. for the sake of what's to come, a visit seems necessary.
why are the faculty in paperfold university from the sweet dreams troupe?
i've never had any hobbies in my life besides spicy food. when i eat spicy food, i feel not only pain, but also joy and comfort it makes me feel like i'm still alive.
i can't say i like the idea of interacting with our surroundings -- especially this deep into the fragmentum. however
y'know, i'll introduce you when you have the time. you're gonna love him.
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
i'll be off to the dock then. stop by anytime.
according to the plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if they've discovered anything.
hm, something you wanted to ask?
i didn't really notice at first -- adler's difficult to get a hold of at the best of times...
what's her deal? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
of course, i've also heard that the answer is nothing more than a two-digit number.
hmm.. so it wasn't to cover anything up? a secret that you didn't want anyone, including us, to find out?
do you see the terminal over there? it can be used to view information already stored in the data bank. do give it a go.
also, there's still one more key character we haven't talked to yet. her connection to cocolia may be the key to cracking this mystery.
ah, you mean the little girl in red? i remember her -- i saw her in the overworld at lady bronya's succession ceremony.
one hundred%. the general sent us.
exactly! my boy cold dragon young -- uh young master dan heng speaks with reason.
indeed. but still, we don't really have an in-depth understanding of the memoria.
all you did was chop down a few monsters. don't get carried away with yourself.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
penacony, the land of the dreams is this truly the paradise you desire?
we have no means to wake them up now. not even your clockwork will do the trick.
someone already has.
one bird longs for the earth, and the other longs for the sky even if robin had to stop her brother with her own hands, she won't give up on him.
he goes by "blade" nowadays? a fitting name for someone who dedicated his mind and body to the ways of the sword.
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
captain huohuo, should we start the ghost hunt now?
and what's more, there were plenty of suspects invited. do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that "black hole" you're wielding?
those moves were pretty unconventional, but the way you blended them into your swordplay was impressive. it's like you've developed your own unique style, miss march.
i don't mean to meddle, but i'd advise you to stay away from that place.
it'll be fine -- we have other people in the underworld working on the investigation too. besides, we don't have any clues yet, so we may as well do something useful.
unfortunately, official dahao didn't hear yunli's promise.
ready yourselves, you two. while this elite player hasn't made her appearance yet, she's unquestionably keeping an eye on you both.
and the joyous tour of toy city has come to an end. it makes me feel sad.
however, their target is not the ordinary guests, but the ambassadors of the ipc. the family will certainly ensure that the safety of the guests is of the highest importance.
thinking back, even if she wasn't too affected by my absence, i do feel guilty.
you've got confidence, my girl, but i don't think you can best yanqing.
i mean, carrying around the sword like that would be pretty conspicuous. wouldn't a thief prefer to take the case as well?
general, did you hear about miss tingyun?
yaoguang has sent a message from the xianzhou yuque, informing us that she wishes to share the results of recent calculations she made within the matrix.
it was because of both of you that qingni escaped unscathed. words cannot express my gratitude.
yes. forming a seal and using their power to curb the spread of the arbor's roots is an important task entrusted to the luofu's high elder.
clara mentioned svarog's "calculation results" many times
you did but to what effect? if words alone were enough to change the heart, this world would be without quarrel. if you wish to rid me of the illusion of dan feng, you must do something for me.
it's a bit of a mouthful, but i liked it at the time it was a rock 'n' roll name.
it portrays a certain kind of sorrow, you know? not your everyday kind of sadness -- it runs much deeper than that.
um it's a little bitter and a little sour
don't worry -- general jing yuan is understanding. i'm sure a small visit won't trouble him -- especially if it's about a young girl's future.
i want to apologize to the owner of the sleepless earl! it's my fault for causing trouble and making a scene on purpose!
yes, we do. still, the artisanship commission is filled with security mechanisms. even the general won't be able to save us in time if we get trapped.
i don't think that's on the cycrane agenda.
...but to inspire them to save themselves.
in that case be careful.
that's because you're in belobog, the last bastion of humanity.
it was a fair match, so no one's to blame. actually, we should be grateful to you -- they were so impressed by your abilities that they said they want to train harder.
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations
what did you tell her?
patience, young man -- we're not far from scalegorge waterscape. the mission the general tasked you with is about to come to an end.
well, ipc staff are free to come and go, as long as they don't break any laws.
well said! the young lady is wise and righteous!
unfortunately, it didn't stop there. from the early days of our journey into asdana, we were already affected by the stellaron. that strange dreamscape where we met... maybe it was a sign that your thoughts were beginning to drift away.
you spent so much time in belobog on your last visit -- you must have passed by here before, right?
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals at least, it was at the time of recording.
do you have any other questions regarding this incident?
a rift? i wouldn't go that far. also, it's me who's mostly to blame -- i didn't keep my subordinates in check.
after meeting all of you, i, argenti, can die without regrets.
my legacy will prove that sampo koski was nothing but a willing and devoted servant of--
affirmation: we can ask herta herself.
just focus on your teaching. why bring me into this?
i'll take some samples for the alchemists to analyze and figure out where the biological tissue comes from.
they dedicate themselves to truth and it's right to say so -- after all, everything they do is for the sake of nous.
i'll leave the reassurance of the researchers in your hands.
miss tingyun, what's this about?
there's no mistaking it this component was taken from gears and wisdom!
by sending out coupons and gifts, we attracted twice as many customers as we normally would. this shows that food is still a big reason why people visit the alley.
yes, photographs often record very precious memories.
shh, follow me. keep quiet and tread lightly
as soon as the restricted zone gate is open, the monsters on the other side will turn out in full force. the guards will do their best to stall them and buy you some time.
really? you better not be making things up!
in other words, it means the tingyuns we see here are all different aspects of her psyche.
as fate would have it, the girl we unwittingly rescued many years ago became the key to defeating cirrus.
well then, that's that. i've still got some other business to attend to, so shall we say goodbye for now?
i heard a lot of heliobi were sealed in the artisanship commission's creation furnace, but they all escaped when the furnace broke that's why my workload is the way it is
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
if i'm not here to help i don't know what might happen in the next wave.
are you ready? don't be too surprised.
there are too many monkeys. it's best that we try to eliminate them.
ah. for some reason, you seem to fit right in here perhaps i read it wrong.
hmph, showing your true colors now that your evil schemes have been exposed? they're calling for their fellow ape fiendlings. please take cover behind me!
it is an internal affair of the vidyadharas. as long as it does not disturb the peace aboard the luofu, it does not involve the general of the cloud knights.
(he's sure saying some weird stuff.)
*sigh* at the end of the day, work is work -- you need it to live. y'know march, adults forget what "relaxation" means after a certain age, hehe
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
i have to admit that these little ones born in the process sometimes move me.
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few it's just like a hidden message left by someone for the nameless.
even after your rebirth, your moves and techniques haven't changed one bit.
looks like some rules weren't distorted. that's a word-for-word account of what i said back then.
the memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. in the memory zone of penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by black swan.
and the assignment involves a curio that doesn't even have a name.
what? now that you have the real robin, i'm useless? oh, how disheartening! i've done so much for the family.
the chief? of course i knew. wildfire are mostly made up of torch and pitchfork types. how could they function without her?
mister yang is a very compassionate person, but thankfully he doesn't pry.
what a frightened look you have. don't worry. since this has nothing to do with you, i won't be suspecting you of anything. why don't you come take a stroll with me?
also, i have a rather abrupt request.
he only wants everyone to return safely to rivet town and live their peaceful lives like before.
i could hardly happen upon vidyadhara bone marrow and test the prescription myself, could i?
it's all right. this is a chapter in history that's already happened anyway.
i believe asta will deal with it properly.
it's logical and hard to disprove.
we'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. there's a bit of time left before we jump. in the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
do you hail from the luofu, young master dan heng?
i can't speak for everyone, but this is how i really feel.
it's getting late, miss march. unlike you lot, i'm a grown-up bound by responsibilities and duties. the tasks entrusted to me by the general won't complete themselves.
it's not like that. you're making this too complicated
gepard? not a chance he's a decent guy, but also famously uncompromising.
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
what can i say? i don't trust it either. for some reason, whenever someone tells me they're gonna do something interesting, i end up imagining a pile of trash
hmm, that's true. anyway, since he asked for help, it's time to give those monsters a shock!
fine, let's see whose desire is stronger, your desire to take it away, or my desire to hunt down all cursed swords!
practices? come on, you make it sound like the "long-standing practices" in this alchemy commission are something great.
mister boothill, i don't know what kind of grudge you hold against the ipc but i don't think we're too different. we both want the whole cosmos' eyes on us!
it made it easy for us but we can't let our guards down.
but i know nothing about swordplay or duels. now, if you're talking about playing celestial jade, that's something i might be able to help with.
i'm guessing that's one of the prototype synthesizers. there may be a curio code on its base.
well, why make "omni" money when you can make ordinary money first~?
i say, my ipc friends, i can see how captivated you are by that coin. am i right in assuming that you're also aetherium wars players?
what are you writing miss march?
on behalf of the astral express, i would like to thank you, master diviner.
serval, i i just want you to know that i would've supported your decision no matter what you chose. i wasn't trying to force you to stay.
of course not~ i'm just amazed at this fancy technique of yours, as usual.
hoolay made a quick escape and even sealed the gates of the prison. as of now, the cloud knights have re-established contact with the staff inside.
sure, no hurry.
why are you being so polite? oh, and why's the city under curfew all of a sudden? has something happened?
when i realized that her "conclusion" was not preserved in memories, i became aware of the bitter truth.
why do you say that, miss acheron?
go, your friends are waiting for you.
it's because we're friends that i feel a little guilty
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
also, those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the invaders seven hundred years ago
perhaps the joy of reuniting after a long time can also be considered just another part of the trailblaze.
is it even awake in there? maybe it's broken down.
what!? no! there was a freezing chill, not to mention the way they drifted through the air they were legit ghosts! anyway, the key point was
leave that to the master diviner i'm afraid i may be somewhat spent
it is a shame that, as a nameless, her path never crossed with the astral express. it would be wonderful if she were aboard
miss hanya, tell me straight does the ten-lords commission actually have a solution?
this calls for brainwaves, not "brawnwaves." how about i take you over myself?
but before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.
i'm not as knowledgeable as lady asta... the only way i can contribute is to help the station improve its defenses, don't you think?
i'm sure jarilo-vi won't be the only planet to have ipc visitors, but i bet not all of them will have a visitor like topaz
that mister reca said i'm better suited for dreamweaver academy instead of charmony academy.
now, penacony as you hoped, has welcomed the dawn after a long, dark night. the path forward may not be a bed of roses, but at least people are prepared to step forth towards freedom.
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
ugh the syrup has turned clumpy i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
they say it will suffice. experiencing the bizarre and motley dreamscape is the best reward.
there you are. i've finally found you, my beloved talents!
no. but i've felt my way around the outside and picked up more than a few clues. i can help you. you have my word.
it's a big job to steal two robots without anyone noticing, especially when one of them has an alarm. i'm guessing that our thief friend never even took little fay.
you shouldn't have said that just now. it'll only make us look suspicious.
if hoolay does come to attack the skysplitter lieutenant yanqing, i need you to hold him there until i am able to arrive.
thank you for your hard work. if there are any other members who still feel uneasy, please tell them on my behalf that protecting the dreamscape requires everyone's help.
of course, i'm sure you have a countermeasure at the ready, master diviner.
this isn't the overworld. we don't do envy and etiquette down here. whatever's on your mind, you can say it.
looks like we've strayed off-topic, miss jade. should we discuss our next steps?
this ring is a piece of evidence, right?
that might be a little harsh, but she does put her own interests first.
there is someone who can attest to my true intentions.
i brought you down. i can take you back up! free of charge, satisfaction guaranteed.
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown
hmm, only problem is the view here isn't great. are you sure we'll be able to watch the aurora?
i think that may be why the stellaron hunters won't leave you alone.
clearly, though, it bears no connection to herta's puppet being attacked.
don't worry, mister svarog. i'm fine.
the principle behind this machine and the one you fixed when you first came to the workshop is the same. you'll understand when you see it.
general, the ceremony has finished. you should take a rest.
march seventh just showed me some dolls that were made to look like the members of the express crew. they're adorable.
it seems that's everything we now know one of the culprit's physical traits and that he is extremely violent. but how can we track him down?
why would a mere robot in the underworld have knowledge of important secrets?
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid i can't even imagine what it must look like.
*sigh* if i'm not careful i'll start boring you all with sob stories from the past. let's get back to you guys. if long-lost bronya told you to come here, you must have something important to tell me?
mm, feels like a good angle.
what do you know? silent but deadly speaks.
finding the answers to these questions shouldn't be too difficult. what truly matters is if we can gather the clues that lead us to the mastermind behind all of this.
greetings, guests from the astral express.
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. i reject the concept of ownership because i don't want the responsibilities that come with it.
what's up? i'll only answer questions about the simulated universe.
you know the chief? then why don't i know you
general is everything okay on the ground?
as far as the astral express is concerned, the ipc will make for an invaluable ally during the negotiations to prevent penacony returning to its former ways.
tasteful oh, you mean the train? i was asking how you felt physically.
so we now know who checked into the hotel. but why are the galaxy rangers revisiting the dreamscape?
i never thought that the underworld would sink into such ruin without the silvermane guards perhaps mother was wrong
allow me to introduce my assistants to you. they help me take care of business at the workshop.
as for the context we'll need to sort that out a bit. hurry along now. recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
as i mentioned previously, when teng xiao and ignamar fought, the scales were balanced.
my dear, why so serious? haven't you been having a great time? i have, at least.
this actually confirms a theory that i've always had: it seems like inquisition spirits are a creation of the elation.
the boundless cosmos unfolded before me. i was completely mesmerized, not just by the view, but by a realization--
yunli says she didn't steal the sword, and i am willing to believe her.
have you still not realized your situation? from the moment you appeared, you were doomed to one fate.
so the three of them teamed up to kill her?
it was the most beautiful sky i had ever seen but all i could feel was unbearable pain. i sunk to the ground and gazed up helplessly.
together with norbert's mumblings about a "shopping street" i think all these clues are pointing in one direction.
i doubt herta is interested in the curio itself.
i don't have to fight all of them right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan
unfortunately, only one master is here. i'm doing fine.
what's happening? is the girl in trouble?
now, i suggest that both of you summon the coin's aether spirit. after all, it's the first one that you've truly acquired for yourselves, it'd be nice for you to get to know each other, don't you think?
the battle is reaching a pivotal point. i have to get to the front line. i'll leave the command post to my officers.
um that was serval's idea. she said it needed a level of secrecy.
sorry, i'm getting a little fixated. if you want to head out, we should go this way.
then why did you bring the cargo to the artisanship commission? you even brought in some shady craftsman. it's obvious that you're trying to steal the ipc's patented technology!
that won't be necessary. i'm sure you already know why, considering your vested interest in reading my thoughts.
we probably need to present it with a command for it to act.
the supreme guardian mentioned there'd be mystery guests attending the solwarm celebrations, but i didn't think it'd be the express crew.
i see. what an interesting technique.
if you consider this a betrayal
mm you're right, it probably doesn't
so, you do have a brain somewhere in all that muscle.
i wonder what the old place is like now. maybe some things will still look familiar.
are any of the paths in this world easy to tread?
i've never felt pressured around you, my lady.
well would you look at that. here comes the big hero.
perhaps, but cycranes can make deliveries between delves.
you still have a good appetite even in the face of disaster -- you truly are the merlin's claw please, finish the food quickly so we can get to work, general feixiao.
the cangcheng? there's a ship called the cangcheng? why haven't i heard of it?
i'll wager that fellow was an intriguing character.
but now, i've also learned that while these merchant principles may apply to humans, they falter in the face of the gods.
y'know what, you're right -- we should work these things out on our own
long time no see! how have you been? clocking in a lot of overtime?
are you worried about her mental state?
hmm i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
and the one in your body is resonating with the stellaron on this world.
he had long since come to some understanding. i could sense a mix of intricate emotions flowing out.
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
affirmative. discounting our discussions on the simulated universe, our interactions are scarce. i look forward to the innovative ideas that may emerge from this juxtaposition of minds.
you are indeed a gambler -- an insane one at that.
i need to give you two a heads up first. our meeting with madam yukong won't be without risk. we need to be prepared and take it seriously.
there are thirty-two versions of my full name circulating among the troops. how do i know? i'm an intelligence officer after all.
i still haven't discussed any of this with the president -- let's go pay them a visit.
what's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? seems pretty normal to me.
and of course, the chance to listen to everyone's stories and adventures from different parts of the cosmos is just amazing.
alright! when people ask you, you might as well tell them this loud and clear.
i'm no match to you when it comes to joking.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
of course not. the memokeepers' divination techniques don't all involve memories.
ooh! sorry, i didn't mean to ruin the intensity of the moment~
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan
come on, how could i possibly lose?
"the stars exploded, and the express has to go everywhere to pick up all the pieces, and that's why it flies up in the sky."
after all, to many, you are the legendary figure who single-handedly built the penacony economy.
thanks to general jing yuan's destruction of the harmonious choir, we were able to escape.
just be grateful that the "little brat" showed you mercy. at least your staff aren't seriously injured.
the man we ran into he doesn't seem happy at all.
i should have known better than to expect anything serious from you.
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
i know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
how about it, this journey of beautiful dreams was it to your liking?
have you guys heard of the luofu?
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
last but not least, even if luocha did encounter all the troubles you described, it wouldn't have taken him two hours to escape.
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
scrap metal, huh? the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
a fitting end to the tale of the departed -- one could not ask for a better farewell. go on, they're all here.
it's the same old place. everywhere you look, there are robots that have lost the ability to function
that's why, during this golden soiree she is the dance's centerpiece.
why, only what we've talked about many times before, of course
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
the president and xiaohan had different perspectives because they came from different backgrounds and i can't help but feel the decisions i made were somewhat restricted by my own background.
i may have been quick to step up to the plate, but confronting the dreammaster could be a very dangerous affair.
ever since i was a little kid, i've always wanted to be an epic hero i never get tired of hearing about the quintet -- i'm sure you'll love it.
i want to go with you, i do! i always wanted to catch a glimpse of the stellaron with my own eyes, and now it's so close
i think we've rounded up all our suspicious clues but did kafka leave them behind on accident or on purpose?
i can sense your enthusiasm for the space station, but i'm afraid i have to turn you away.
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal tends to leave a deep impression.
i like to keep my scythe sharp so i can get a good night's sleep on it.
i even managed to recover the gift money. things haven't gone this smoothly since i walked through the doors of the reverie... now, i'm only one step away from victory. let's just wait and see.
i'm not joking around, and i'm not making up some crazy story
there must be an inextricable connection between the stellaron we're dealing with here, and jarilo-vi becoming a frozen planet.
hiding something extraordinary with something extraordinary this is pretty herta. i assume you know what to do? i mean, you've read that catalog for quite a while.
mister svarog, let's get started
all those complicated puzzles and unnecessary ploys nothing more than "games," i'll wager.
your run-of-the-mill robots don't have a will of their own. their aim is merely svarog's aim.
this must be the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish the causal relationships between objects.
haha, if that's what it takes to bring peace to the entire universe, it's a price i'll gladly pay.
if shorter wavelengths could be observed, it'd make for a good thesis... but that's not the focus of today.
it may look like her, but the fragmentum can only create forgeries. bring her down!
why isn't svarog helping you?
*sigh* the child in the footage has black hair. luocha's hair is blonde.
in my estimation, there's no question about it. this is murder.
as i expected, it's come to your attention too. the memoria nearby has been mutating ever since slumbernana monkey gained popularity.
well, we now know the answer to both murder cases that have caused such commotion in penacony. as for the intentions of the mastermind behind it all we're still none the wiser.
you're here. i've just finished re-inscribing the seal on huohuo's tail. next, it's time to address the matter of cirrus.
those two sisters epitomize the failures of the xianzhou alliance -- no one can live well and no one can die well. if even death is a luxury, then what kind of monsters have we become?
an "aether cartridge" is a chip that punklordian hackers use to edit reality. the ways through which a hacker perceives and modifies the world are recorded on the chip.
but with the arrival of the stellaron, things have become messy. some delves even had their entrance marked as the exit.
i guess, as a warrior, i always have to keep challenging myself.
from the exam results, it looks like there's nothing wrong with your brain. mister luka, have you been eating anything unusual lately?
i've yet to experience it myself, but no one in their right mind would turn down a chance to journey through space.
yes it was also the bane of everything to come.
now this type of cushion looks like it'd help with fatigue. y'know, from sitting too long?
because you used dirty tricks to trample all over the honest work of others!
no sleep for you either, huh?
there's a fault with one of the energy supply units at the base. if i don't repair it soon, everyone at the settlement will be affected.
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
likewise, miss! the more the merrier!
it's all my fault -- i've been putting too much on your plate. that's why you looked up ways to manage the pressure...
regardless of the ipc's wishes, positive changes need to be made to aurum alley.
bring it on. i'm ready for your challenge.
you're keen about appearing in my films, aren't you? come over here and choose a script.
i learned to sense incoming visitors after people kept barging in so frequently.
dan heng and i will go back to the express first. you and march finish up here and come back soon, alright?
three, two, one mung beaaaan!
ever since the express tour, i've been wondering
a memory zone of this level is mere child's play to a memokeeper. come on. let's head out through the front door.
...one who managed to take out two ipc members under the noses of our fleet. do you understand what that means?
i understand, miss bronya -- no need to explain. your city is facing immense difficulties -- my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.
if i were you, mister president, i would think of ways to translate the success of that one sample into something that can benefit everyone.
now that i think about it, it was good that bronya got there when she did in belobog -- if she came any later, we probably wouldn't have ended up as friends~
we have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times it's hard to tell from just a few words on the internet.
are we talking about a real bet here? i don't wanna wager anything just to escape your clutches.
while you still have a long journey ahead, i have no doubt our paths will cross again one day. till we meet again, friends of wildfire!
she mentioned the cloud knights were at the alchemy commission -- i should find a ship and regroup with my unit. what about you?
i didn't disturb you since you were in a deep sleep.
got it, the encryption key! quick, before we attract attention, let's--
now is not the time to use your reputation like that.
exactly! now do you believe that my content isn't clickbait?
i trust that you can handle it. besides, himeko will be there. she'll be able to handle any decisions should you run into any difficulties.
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
herta uses that place to welcome visitors from across the stars, or to welcome members of the genius society. however, due to the legion's invasion, it is no longer open to the public.
the decor in here's a little loud for my tastes. so this is how astral high society does things, huh?
i didn't mean it that way. since you've already drawn your swords, you'd be disappointed if you didn't get to test one another, right?
its power is much greater than those factions that simply draw their strength from the paths themselves.
what a simple answer. you, too, understand that idle chatter leads only to poverty.
thank you! now that you have joined our revival project, i'm sure many others will follow suit.
i know cocolia's style -- get everyone into a frenzy first.
yes. my mother and i once spent eleven long polar nights there.
calm down, i heard you. it'd be rude of me to depart without thanking our benefactors.
master yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. i don't think you have very good taste.
even you benefactors have probably lived longer than me.
the fact that i can participate in the wardance to fight for my home today shows that he didn't fail.
in my estimation, this heliobus was not an overwhelming problem for you. besides, each of you has appeared to gain something from this series of events.
correct. such are the twists of destiny.
however, it's difficult to discard one's past. yukong and caiyi trusted each other with their lives. the helm master will have strong memories of that time.
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
exactly. on that fateful day, i was reassigned, dismissed from my department's core operations.
since it's a classic puzzle, the answer is "people," right?
it's just i haven't found enough clues yet. the thief is really tricky. they haven't left any traces in the dwelling
i was brought here by the borisin. please make sure to report this news.
you too. be quiet and apologize to yanqing!
looks like it. bronya hasn't arrived yet, though. let's find somewhere to wait.
you see these people? they're all miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
you are now inside the data link of the aether cartridge. look around and tell me what you discover.
such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, but as a means to an end i need to put this aside for a more indifferent process.
we didn't speak all that much you know how it is, i can only talk to dad for so long before i start losing it.
the express has faced all kinds of obstacles on its journey -- today is just another one. it's no reason to stop trailblazing.
what are all these swords doing in dragonprayer terrace?
hey! you're being too loud if the culprit is nearby, he'll just run away!
do you really think of yourself as someone so exceptionally amazing? right now, you're more like like like someone from the nitwit society.
it's as i said - it is a very important reference for the simulated universe -- that is why its data has been extracted and added to the calculations of the universe model.
...no, that won't do. the rules of the contest are sacred and inviolable, just like the beauty.
you two have held out long enough -- help is at hand!
well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. i'm natasha -- a doctor in the underground. you've already spent a day in my clinic.
so i told him about the express, and eventually he stopped crying and started asking so many questions.
that must be robin. she's also here, in dreamflux reef.
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
yeah, of course, every underworlder worth their salt knows how to fix a mine cart. let me see
these stairs they seem to have become more narrow.
no related records exist in the data bank, but i have a theory: the hidden dangers of the order have always been within the harmony -- and this issue existed within the family from the very beginning.
it's virtually impossible to destroy a stellaron. no one, not even herta, has found a way to break its structure. the best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
so, what do you think, general feixiao? have the doubts in the report been cleared up?
it looks like the "endgame" that general jing yuan has been trying to avoid is fast approaching. sushang, please head to the seat of divine foresight and fetch the general.
hahahaha, i do not seek to take dan heng away from you.
uh, we're still lacking a pillow in here. although someone who can sleep comfortably on a cardboard box probably doesn't need one
less asking, more helping.
it seems that your operations have met with some success.
rather than hearing endless explanations, would you like to experience it for yourself?
meditating with my eyes closed. that gets more difficult as time goes on.
whose side are you on?
mm -- "take responsibility for your choices and the people of belobog" every landau is driven by that ethos.
interesting mm, let's run an imaging test first to confirm that your brain has no organic issues. a fighter's bound to run into such problems.
so you made me go through all this effort to repair junjun just so you could sell him?
i think i know what it will concern. even if oleg wasn't looking for me, i would've looked for him.
don't worry, sushang. right now, i'm cool as a cucumber inside a block of ice!
with all due respect, you don't honor your sword, so you don't deserve it.
there probably won't be any surprises happening on family territory, which is a bit of a shame if you ask me. but hey, it's rare that we can take a break and let loose. let's enjoy it.
unbelievable to think there's a settlement of this size within the dreamscape and all beyond the family's reach.
the guest rooms are charmingly minimalist
the borisin's era has long passed. did they ever tell you these harsh facts before giving you hope for returning home, lord hoolay?
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
around seven or eight years? why?
great! then let me give you a demonstration first.
enjoy the present moment.
you're asking about the reverie in the dreamscape, right? i'm not sure exactly either, i'm sorry
wait here a moment, miss -- i'll be right back.
weird, this place is quite different from the hotel, but i just feel like i've been here before and even lived here for a while.
don't you think the poetry and songs of the xianzhou people are enchanting? one time i asked shangshang to teach me to write poetry, and she only wrote four words in three months i don't think i'll be able to learn at this rate.
i don't think trying to shift the blame is a wise choice.
hmph, no problem, svarog. bring it on!
leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken penacony from this dream.
there is no need to tell me your answer. i just felt like asking the question. how should i take care of them? perhaps leaving them at the space station is the best choice.
i remember yanqing once said, "there are many ways to defeat villains, but if you want to become a true hero, you have to focus on self-improvement."
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
well then, let's go find wildfire to discuss our next move and see if they have any new discoveries.
mmm, what is it then my answer is "bugs." is that right?
but that general huaiyan, he looks so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. is that old man really an arbiter-general?
i'm just speculating. in any case, we have to be careful when handling aventurine. he's skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. also
moreover, i need to know her identity. if i'm lucky, she could be an important pawn. and it's good to have more helpful friends when dealing with this matter.
well, my work here is finished. now to make sure you get to a safe destination.
a lot like you, actually.
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
speaking of the wolf hunt operation, i'm truly worried about the yaoqing messenger who was taken hostage. hoolay was starving in the shackling prison for centuries i don't know if the messenger can survive in that wolf's clutches.
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
first, we have lady fu xuan of the divination commission. what do you think best suits her?
unless you want to sleep in a cardboard box, i suggest prioritizing the renovation of your bedroom first.
i'm already very happy that i get to visit your express like this once in a while.
the module used to detect emotions was frequently damaged, eventually turning him into a small robot that did nothing but collect parts.
i do shoulder much of the blame for the current state of the alchemy commission. i am deeply grateful that she is willing to let go of past grudges and come back to the luofu to save the commission from collapse.
this guitar was actually given to me as a birthday present by cocolia a long time ago.
don't worry. you're just in time. it's been a while, my friends from the astral express!
i hope they won't take offense, but i have taken notice of your conductor -- i find them to be extraordinary.
but i must remind you that the crimes of dan feng have had far-reaching implications and some people, such as those in scalegorge waterscape, will not be much moved by the issuance of a paper edict.
you mean how it looks? like a train. well
i know what you wish to say yanqing. we can move past the melodrama.
i asked him to leave this case to me. perfect for the second step of the training, right?
i--it's great we finally found the component! let's go fix the stove!
we've helped pascal find compatible hardware. if we can eliminate the muddled information without damaging the sectors linked to his emotional intelligence
hehe, let's not go overboard. still, it was dangerous -- let's not do anything like that again.
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me"
did you ingest the brumedew concentrate pellet i gave you?
transformation is a kind of suffering, yet it invariably accompanies the end of what once was
those who travel the vastness of the universe for extended periods will often find their bodily cycles to be in some sort of disarray. it's a form of space sickness.
in my opinion, the force that provided the stellaron and the force that activated it have different objectives.
since this offer comes from those who left us to our fate for more than a decade how would you react if wildfire refused? hmm? would you use force?
i wouldn't rule it out -- she's good at reading people's minds she would've known that you'd never set foot in qlipoth fort voluntarily.
alright, let's head out before it gets late.
i must listen to him very carefully -- we cannot afford to miss any information.
we have clear objectives and the terrain is relatively easy to read. my officers are well-trained -- the command system will be in good hands.
the place you are going to is called rivet town. follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
the monsters of the fragmentum don't need any materials we humans use. and if they did take anything, this place would look much messier
thank you! as appreciation, i'd like to give you a token gift.
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
i say you belong to the space under the manhole cover, not in a dream. there's one right over there. off you go!
calling starskiff haven. have all cloud knights be on full alert for borisin attacks!
wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
mister wonweek here is an old acquaintance of sunday's.
dangerous? in my humble opinion, the real danger is always the hand wielding the weapon.
in his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. that would be the best place for him to go. so that will also be our final battlefield.
perhaps that's why sunday is taking this matter so seriously.
no. he didn't say, and i didn't ask.
shoulda, coulda, woulda, seele! activating the gear bridge alone would've been enough to expose us.
the express has traveled world after world. we are merely passing travellers -- witnesses to part of a grander story.
of course, being a spectator is the easiest. lil gui's up there in the stands right now, watching us duke it out from her vantage point. she's such a baddie.
sis, you look a bit pale. did something happen?
clara? don't worry about her. that girl is best pals with svarog -- she's always following behind him. he wouldn't harm her.
games like these always stir up childhood memories. i remember watching similar tv shows back when i was just a kid.
that's why grandpa hid it from me, so i wouldn't make a hasty decision
eh? that's weird i pressed the button already. i wonder what went wrong
this is a divine object from the reignbow arbiter? where did you find this?
i'm so sorry, arlan. until i spoke with dan heng, i never realized how much pressure was on your shoulders.
with your brilliant mind you shouldn't have any trouble recalling what was here last time, right, doctor?
they may have used a cloudhymn to create mist and provide a smokescreen. i'm afraid this ambush was probably lying in wait for us
the luofu really is a bit conservative. if we encountered a heliobus on the zhuming that was this capable and had no harmful intentions, we would definitely not seal it up.
i was roaming around as an ordinary person when i unfortunately fell into that pepeshi's trap. the prank that fragmented miss tingyun also divided my fragile self into two.
that's fine. we should find another place to talk anyway. we drew some attention with that commotion earlier.
where did these guys come from? huh, the general was right -- there's a threat lurking on the xianzhou itself.
judging from how active the robot was, its core isn't just scrap metal. it should be repairable.
there are so many of them are you sure the fissure only recently opened up?
you are excellent fighters. i'd love to have you provide training for the guards, but i know you have places to be.
if you have questions about the express, himeko can give you the best answer.
we haven't seen a silvermane guard down here for a long time now. i just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
hello, are you here for a bit of exalting sanctum scenery too?
so, you're admitting your defeat, huh? if you're not even confident to teach, why don't you let me be the ringmaster instead?
you sure have a lot of cards up your sleeve.
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
after a strange encounter, i was fragmented into multiple "tingyuns," each embodying a different aspect of my memories.
the kindling of this unique flame must be the missing curio that herta's been searching for. and duke inferno is evidently spawned from it.
say, you mentioned before that you saw a clockie that only you could see, right?
indeed, we need some time to digest such a wealth of information.
i think i understand what's going on. it's not unusual to be anxious when you're far away from home. when your nerves were thrown into disarray, the sweet dreams soda you drank intensified it.
since assuming the role of helm master, it's rare that i have the chance to gaze upon the stars like this
if an admirer of the beauty gets lost in the pursuit of power, they risk descending into "the omen of evil," a form which is neither human nor beast.
i hope all this chaos will end soon.
alright, the coast is clear. let's keep moving.
yes and now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left
i can't guarantee that's what she's thinking, miss qingni. you should talk with her yourself.
three, two, one cheeeese!
i mean why not? "aurum alley -- a luofu top-ten destination for outworlders." so, have you made up your mind? are we shooting bailu or you?
even on the zhuming, it's rare to see a soldier and a heliobus have such a symbiotic relationship, as if they are of one heart and mind. this soft-scented girl is really something~
is that so? well, i think you did the right thing. it's better to move forward with the burden of knowledge than to tread a perilous road with blind optimism.
here, here, take it! mister cold feet always keeps his word. it's been a pleasure doing business with you!
so whereabouts are you guys from, anyway? i don't mean to pry or anything, i just care about my friends! no pressure
*sigh* there are three things in the world that i can't seem to rid myself of: the troubles of the xianzhou, the papers on my desk, and the weeds in my garden.
this truth must be discovered by himself -- no one can teach it to him. now is the time for him to take that step.
but i i don't have a life of my own
it seems my puzzles are too effortless for you, ipc ambassador.
go. tell giovanni i said hi.
indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. crafting careful and precise plans like this is simply not their style.
wait! even though the borisin can disguise themselves, they can't turn into someone as short as me! put your sword away.
we were just talking to her in the museum do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
blade tracking entry: traces run cold at starskiff haven.
let's hope we can reach a consensus that satisfies everyone.
let's move out. we need to clear a way for wildfire and the guards.
selling everything you had? why would you go to such lengths?
the retrieval of my lifeforms isn't complete yet. there's more than just one, and some are stored in a sealed zone.
such is the terrible nature of the abominations of abundance. we subjected him to the forest of swords to drain his life force, but in the end, his punishment turned into a test of our patience.
mines are our lifelines in the underworld. we have to keep providing geomarrow to the overworld in exchange for supplies.
a patient's medicine doesn't just reveal their illness. it also offers a window into their desires and needs.
hello. may i ask what happened here?
it's a shame. the stars no longer belong to me. perhaps one day i shall feel their embrace once again, but it will undoubtedly be the day of my last flight.
yet, for the sake of this film, i am willing to forgo some of my standards to offer some tiny clues to you and the other ranger.
well, bladie? are you satisfied?
but i'm not very strong physically. are you referring to my quick wits?
well, my curiosity got the better of me i suppose. when i heard miss march's pondering about what to learn, i couldn't help but wander over.
i fully agree with you, helm master yukong, this is indeed an internal affair.
he said, as long as i kept moving forward, i'd eventually reach my desired destination. and then, it was as if i heard
he had bandages all over his body -- most of his wounds hadn't healed yet but, it was the first time he'd ever smiled at me. i still remember that expression.
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
this jack's placement is odd. the chip is buried deep inside. if you don't look closely enough, you won't even find it
it's all about the bartender's pride. it wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. that's the mindset i use when i brew my coffee.
it seems they infiltrated stargazer navalia in order to prepare for hoolay's escape, and we foiled their plans by pure chance.
however, your zealousness inhibits your ability to hide your line of attack.
your calculations are slightly on the conservative side.
the time has come. let it be revealed
perfect! i chose it carefully -- it's perfect for beautiful young swordswomen like you and me!
logic: a third party saved them.
i invited you here to gain a better understanding of the express, not bore you with these trivialities.
about music? i'd say i'm more of a casual listener than a hardcore enthusiast.
serval said that the stellaron was very likely hidden in the snow plains north of belobog. if we want to get there, i'm afraid we'll have to find the exit to this fragmentum maze first.
um no, there's one more thing we still need to find out why pascal was stealing parts in the first place.
about where doctor primitive went.
just remember to come back often. make an appointment in advance with asta or arlan so i can make time to study you.
so the interastral peace broadcast specifically broadcasts the news? that's exactly what old mettle likes.
we don't intend to pry into private business, helm master yukong, but if there's anything we can help with, please don't hesitate to ask.
looks like my analysis is spot-on. follow me, you two. let me give you a taste of the adult world!
it's the main commercial street in the exalting sanctum, although it's a lot quieter since the whole stellaron crisis thing.
i feel a warmth from these emotions. i feel drawn to this quality, and try to respond back in my own way
if i remember our discussion correctly, i think there are two main possibilities: the architects, and the stellaron. i'm inclined to think it's the latter, but we lack evidence.
before dan heng arrived, everything was quiet as a windless lake. in that regard, it is understandable that they want to get rid of him.
what happens next is going to blow your mind
who would've thought the general would take such a liking to you? i suppose i must accompany you further fate can be so unpredictable.
to the xianzhou, i am but an abandoned pawn -- a wandering swordmaster. if you wish to avoid trouble, pretend we never met.
but did your mentor tell you her "good intentions" led her to perform certain healing arts on dan heng, who had just finished his hatching rebirth, so that he would regain the memories of his past life?
general jing yuan?
shortly after you left, it crashed to its death right in front of your window.
they sure made us run, though. if i ever have to run like that again on the job, i'm filing for worker's comp.
and should our feathers be damaged, then we share our wings with one another.
i wonder what's in there. here, let me open it
some vagrants also make modifications to their pets, which they call pet upgrades.
the rest are fine, mostly minor injuries. but i'm worried about their mental states.
well technically we didn't find all the parts, and if we called in the experts to put it back together, they would have realized
then, do you trust me?
i'm honored to be invited aboard the express.
the ipc does have more capital on hand, but the review criteria are not solely focused on financial resources.
when you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
there are ipc advertisements everywhere. it's about time i got in touch with their trade commissioner.
it is a feeling i have encountered when approaching worlds that have been polluted by the cancer of all worlds
hahahaha! our scheme is coming along nicely! but i fear that svarog just isn't the swaying type. *sigh* you'll understand when you get to his territory. things never run smoothly down here.
she gave the order to expel me herself and refused to see me i never understood that behavior, and i gave up trying to use logic to work it out a long time ago.
the cloud knights have many martial arts traditions. who was it that instructed you in swordplay, young man?
they're not lying, i promise you.
oh my, i didn't know you had dreams of stardom, dan heng.
once you're back, come find me on the railway platform. then you'll understand everything.
there i learned to read and write from natasha. at the age of ten, i started to patrol the mines with oleg, occasionally getting into fights with the local thugs
damned gambler. any true collaboration demands trust. did that notion somehow escape your sigonian upbringing?
it's your turn to ask a question. come see me when you're ready.
there was a huge shaking just now coming up through the ground. mister svarog said it must have been
the borisin on the ground suddenly launched an attack. general feixiao was concerned that this was all a diversion by hoolay, so i requested to come to the skysplitter and provide support.
"every time i gaze at the shimmering lights beneath the waves, it feels as though i'm back in this place, standing by your side"
what i mean to say is, comfort comes second to business. we generally use the company's mass-produced transport ships.
the solution is right in your hand.
the streets aren't owned by the merchant guild or the ipc but by those who live here.
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
i kindly request an immediate warp jump out of the asdana star system.
i see. congratulations on having a clear goal. your film will surely be a hit at the box office.
that foxian girl has indeed been through an unimaginable turn of events. i suppose that's the fate you organic lifeforms are bound by.
don't worry. let me think again.
its original owner was an ancestor of the landau family -- rhonda landau. she was one of our great heroes who participated in the defense of belobog seven hundred years ago.
i was lucky enough to be chosen by the alliance to come in and clean up all the old grime in the alchemy commission.
according to the survey results, the stellaron is likely to the north of belobog somewhere in the vast snow plains.
the starskiff voyage log can be accessed through the dock navigator array.
every guest who comes aboard
it doesn't matter why grandpa chose that sword, i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands.
i still remember the name engraved on this sword the day it was forged, guyun. it was forged by hanguang, a craftsman from the zhuming's flamewheel forge.
additionally, the fact that the borisin need medicine to disguise themselves suggests that there are still moles within the alchemy commission assisting them covertly.
i think, i, more or less, maybe, perhaps i'm ready!
who's this? herta?
the luofu? didn't the antimatter legion launch an ambush on the luofu some time ago? was she one of the few survivors?
of course that wouldn't work. neither do i have any intentions of pushing ninja initiates to adopt the way of the dazzling ninja.
after all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
the illusion was so impossibly blissful that i realized it was just a dream.
we got up early to press on with our journey. did you sleep well last night?
didn't you hear him? he said he needs to take care of a few matters in the city first. if we're fast enough, we can stay out of his way.
before joining the stellaron hunters, elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. that's all he said. as for the rest, it's up to me to find out.
listen: you are in a daze right now. you don't know who you are, why you're here, or what you're going to do next. you think i look familiar, but you're not sure if you should trust me--
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver i just want to get there in one piece.
how i wish that in the next film, you can call me something better, my wonderful actor.
also, i--it's not like i'm never coming back. and if i really miss him i can just pester the heck outta him over the phone, right?
i heard a raven cawing in the distance it seems the dreammaster will arrive soon.
seems like not even those craftsmen know where the arsenal is at this rate, we won't find anything, and grandpa might take me away before i can do anything
but she could use some extra hands. would you mind helping her out?
a cloud knight never gambles with official business. but in any case, you won't beat me.
well! we only protect the integrity of the goods and prevent anyone with ill intentions from getting their hands on them, for example
now that the alliance has all of you there to help them, sending any elite fighters more would just be overkill.
why do you think i've come here? we've found a way to dispel the eternal freeze, to seal the fragmentum. it might be the only lifeline this world has left!
we can! i heard a pretty good steak place opened up in the south of the administrative district. we can go try it out together.
the golden dream is getting restless. in the coming long night, i'm afraid you will face many tribulations and witness many tragedies. and finally... your sight will only see black and white.
sorry to interrupt whatever's happening here.
remember, train hard and relish every moment! the title awaits you!
some may find her personality unbearable -- i can understand the sentiment, but i simply don't care. of course, herta knows this too, so i accepted her invitation.
why don't i just get this one called "kumquat curls"! curly orange hair, it's perfect for taking pictures and shopping!
stay still, benefactors my instinct tells me something's not right here.
the tides come and go, but the ancient sea remains the same. for us vidyadhara, there's nothing more nostalgic than our homeland.
unsheathe your swords and show me what you've got, march!
i've been watching her closely for a while now, and the first "invitation" was in the banquet hall of the hotel.
just like at cloudford, stargazer navalia's meridian pin has malfunctioned. the checkpoint there is abandoned and the garrison is scrambling to locate the stellaron.
speaking of which, how are things with the whistling flames?
it feels like we're just dancing to the heliobus's tune
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
moreover, i hear that yanqing is an excellent swordmaster, and that he will be representing the luofu as the ringmaster, so it seems like a perfect gift for him.
so long, my friends. may the preservation bless your journey.
but someone didn't agree with that assessment, and it just so happens i was able to fulfill his request.
why don't you youngsters join the new students? you could explore the campus, experience student life
she left herself a back door in the office, performed a proxy hack the moment you entered the simulated universe, and found a way to continue alongside us.
well, uhh you do look very different from other people.
of course, you can confer with your colleagues as well, or go as far as to use me in turn -- i welcome that notion. because it will also show me your true value.
when i first got to the space station, the researchers had prepared a room for me. i--i was really grateful, but it was far away from everyone else. that was a bit disheartening.
it's when it stops beating that we need to worry. just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
you're not worried i'll take the opportunity to escape?
as long as i can fulfill that deep-seated desire i don't care how long i live.
we've arrived. there's an elevator here, just like in the lobby. we should be able to reach our destination with it.
but you know that he's a crazed gambler. the more vocal he is about it, the more cautious i must be.
you're still the same -- carefree as always.
oh? so now that "survival" won't convince us, you want to talk about "interests"?
when the eternal freeze finally lifts, people will be able to get around more easily, and the railway will expand. one day, it'll connect different cities -- not just belobog.
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
i mean, i love a sweet deal as much as anyone, but i still have common sense -- there has to be a catch, right?
in the coming weeks, i'll also invite all of you to a meeting with general feixiao, where you may need to answer her questions and clear up any doubts she might have. so, please be prepared for the meeting.
my master and general jing yuan have an unpleasant history with each other. but personal grudges are a luxury that adults cannot afford!
*sigh* i wanted to keep it with me but that's the problem with old things -- the less you use them, the easier they break. besides, no one's paying me to fix it, right?
ha, that's something i do know. it's an aurumaton -- they're service robots on the xianzhou.
when the trace of the hunted disappears, the hunter better think twice
i gotta say, there were more than a few times where i wanted to lend a hand but himeko said i should let you youngsters rise to the trailblazing challenges
it's true that this ring was bestowed upon our people by the heavens, but that doesn't mean it can't be thrown away.
it's called professionalism, alright?
as it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. but the vagrants have their own custom: see it, share it.
that is up to you to interpret -- herta and i have always been frank with one another. sharp conversations of that nature happen on a regular basis. it wouldn't be fitting to call it an act.
he's the reincarnation of imbibitor lunae, and the person behind him is the newest member of the crew. i've heard a lot about you.
i'm sorry i really can't help you with this.
mister gepard, are you ready? i'm here to return that victory you lent me!
anyway, no point in standing around here worrying. i'm heading back to the alley. talk to you soon!
please can you explain to us again the details of the case?
that's right -- this expedition was commissioned by the ten lords themselves. i am unsure as to why they attached so much importance to this endeavor, but i have a theory.
i didn't know the helm master of the sky-faring commission dealt with situations like this in person.
oh wow, i remember now, the illustrious miss himeko! some of my colleagues dream about meeting you!
oh wow i can't imagine that. i'm sorry, the xianzhou yaoqing doesn't have much artificial snow.
my friend, did you really make an appointment with him?
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
okay! i'll go ask for you right now.
therefore, luocha is just the name i use at xianzhou. outside of xianzhou, i use something more difficult to pronounce. i'm guessing you want to know that name, too?
it seems like the intel we got from svarog caused her a significant shock but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
dahao and the others are probably not aware of what that "dangerous object" might be. but we know for a fact that it's the stellaron.
they embody life's delights and pleasures, but are equally fragile and short-lived... such regret is inevitable, so let it be.
where is mister shamari right now? i'd like to meet him.
why was this tv dumped on the side of the road?
i trust you guys. but regarding what happened in the theme park, what do you hounds think about it? it's okay. feel free to speak your mind.
this decision is beyond us. if what they say is true, then only the supreme guardian may decide their fate.
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
i appreciate it. thank you, new friend whose age i won't try to estimate we're heading back to the lounge.
don't worry, the silvermane guards are trained for these situations. where do we find them?
haha, my retainer, yanqing, has mentioned you. you are one of the only people on the luofu that was able to deprive him of his sword.
...and stopped responding to messages in the same time window!
glad to hear it. people say that academic years are some of the happiest of their lives. i'm sure you'll be leaving with fond memories.
i'm fine, really. i just got into a few skirmishes down in the underworld, but nothing i couldn't handle.
yeah! i heard some buzz about this special partner database on the astral express.
i'd take that with a grain of salt. even if they do exist, odds are she lost them.
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those
open this door... take a look at the mesmerizing dreamscape, while you can still remember.
you ready yet? if you want to keep wasting time, i'll just go on ahead by myself.
even so, himeko indicated that the source of stellarons remains mysterious, and there are no realistic ways to remove a stellaron's contamination.
good work. you did very well.
he needs you. it's essential if we want to reclaim penacony. recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, i opted to join forces with him.
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
totally used to it~ pela and i have already struck fear into the hearts of more than a few newbies.
a thrilling race among the stars can help calm high-strung emotions.
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
young man, if you wish to apprehend someone, shouldn't you have a reason?
lamentable my ninja speed isn't fast enough to outrun cause and effect.
there are wandering monsters nearby -- they'll spell trouble if we let them hang around. go take care of them -- your victory is certain.
but that miss firefly is truly mysterious. there's no information on her in the hotel system. even if she's a stowaway she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
and don't worry even if things don't go smoothly. once the wolf hunt operation is over, the hidden truths will come to light.
himeko was calm from the very beginning. she kept telling me to trust you youngsters' decisions.
we should start with the person who opened the jade gate. if it turns out they're not friendly, then at least they've already made things easier for us. if it turns out they were just doing their job, then we can ask them what happened here.
the ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, i'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
he wasn't in bad shape when we found him. thank you for holding back.
now please be a good boy and don't move.
indeed -- it's about that time. i guess that explains why pom-pom is in such a hurry.
ha, you're fine! just take a breather
everyone, listen up. i will personally take charge of starskiff haven, evacuate the people, and prepare for any possible attacks. i will do my best to ensure that things are safe on the ground.
there it is -- it's hazy, but it's ifrit's voice. the other one is probably his progeny.
this is where the mechanical waste is disposed of though. could it be
so, how can i help? not sure on the arrangement, or?
no, but this door is locked.
look how smashed up this ceiling tile is... arlan must have bottled up his frustration and had no way of releasing it -- so he took it out on the monsters!
strange this is different from the breaking of the seal. why's there no reaction?
they are a group that carries a balance scale with them at all times. they believe all the justice in the universe needs to be achieved through individual deeds.
i only wish to express my blessings for the express. these are words specially imbued with a blessing of remembrance -- they hail from a distant, ancient planet.
don't worry! madam yukong is kind-hearted too. come on now, i'll lead the way.
apart from darkness, this place is all that i remember of the luofu.
did himeko tell you about march seventh? she was trapped in ice, floating through space. we happened upon her and rescued her.
ah, a word of advice for you before we part ways -- a word of warning from someone who's been in your shoes before
did i sleep for long?
i see. thank you for your valuable insights.
taking hoolay back to the yaoqing means a lot to the foxians on the ship and to the general herself. so, stay alert.
truth be told, i do not find the way i entered the act to be satisfactory, but i believe your acting will make this scene better.
yes, and i believe their relationship with gallagher may run deep -- why else would they be so clandestine about their discussion? regardless, we have to find gallagher.
no, but what is predetermined is the future that has value.
your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. i imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
come on, you're too modest for your own good.
leave this to us, we'll take care of it as per your wishes, madam yukong.
remember, try to avoid being noticed. remaining hidden will increase our chances of success.
the dreammaster rarely grants an audience -- even for us. but given the urgency of the situation, he's agreed to meet us in person.
if it's her, she will earn the respect and assent of all the vidyadhara on the luofu.
i assume you heard our conversation just now?
i promised her that i would help her rebuild the connection between the overworld and the underworld, that's all.
oh? to encounter deeds so vile they stir one's very soul...
is everyone okay?
so, it seems my source was right: who'd have thought that such a strong bond could exist between a giant robot and a little girl? so heartwarming!
and if you enjoy music, you could head to neverwinter workshop. you can sometimes catch an outdoor performance there. the artist is *sigh* you'll see.
then let us snap them all out of their disillusionment!
my name is tingyun, the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. please look after me from now on, benefactor.
this contract can prove that the merchant guild has legitimate rights to operate the dock.
the silvermane guards are continuously engaged with the enemy, but i'm afraid the situation is bleak after your meeting with the supreme guardian, i would like to consult you on this matter. *sigh* we're lacking in intel.
this murderer is a psycho... but i have to admit, the case should be easy to crack. we can leverage the family's malfeasance and let the ipc use this as a reason to intervene.
instead of wasting your life learning useless swordplay, why not invest in our civilian mechs? you'll have your master kneeling and begging for mercy in no time.
you kids move fast! by the look on your faces, i assume you come bearing good news?
that voice said: "run! run! run away quickly! you'll die if you don't!"
am i just a wandering spirit now?
you're the first ten-lords commission judge i've met. what do you guys do, exactly?
that won't be necessary. i remember it all.
also, the mountain wind during this season usually comes from the north, which is another reason why we couldn't camp on that previous slope. these two hills can block the snow plains gales for us.
huh? what's it got to do with anything organic? i thought mechanical parts were fine in the tournament.
look, like i said -- brute force can also solve things.
my fear is that this might prove too big a setback, bigger than his exuberance
but first, i need a guide to show me where these automatons are buried.
and she won't tell us what happened. we're really worried and want to help, but we don't know where to start.
thousands of years ago, we foxians were enslaved by the borisin, not because we were naturally weaker, but because of their lupitoxin. this pill is for our own mental well-being.
well, it seems that your answers have addressed all my questions.
elio ordered sam and i to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
therefore, you could say that you are a one-of-a-kind stellaron vessel.
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur
did the person you wanted to say them to leave?
back so soon? any news?
agh, enough apologizing. my ears can't take any more.
i don't think anyone realized, but back then we were so close we didn't even differentiate between each other's possessions. we shared pretty much everything.
i've informed himeko and mister yang already. they'll seal the stellaron.
this is a memory fortune pouch i prepared for the express crew. my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
i do not wish to speculate on the reason behind helm master yukong's reluctance to fly, nor do i want to open up old wounds.
you, too, are worried for my safety? you may not have realized, but you have a unique and noble soul. i hope i can keep my promise to escort you to your destination.
this is not good. everyone, we must hurry.
no, i refuse! profnana, have you ever wondered why i ended up under your control?
oh? so mister yang is also versed in memoria dynamics. i was just trying to figure out how to explain this huge hole to everyone. i bet you guys have a lot in common with miss kaimee!
hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
*sigh* there are many types of friend she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
of course not. i wouldn't dare look down on one of the ipc's legendary employees.
you were right. the enemy's invasion has spread to the deepest parts of the simulated universe. they were only a hair away from the aether cartridge's data link. what we are seeing are the projections of what happened in those moments.
since you already know what you're doing, i'll also have to remind you of its risks.
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
exactly! for me, the nameless represent the ideal hero. i hope to follow in their footsteps.
you can try -- and we'll see if the harmony rejects you.
we were talking about my student, luka.
well, they were a little emotional at the time, but i'm afraid that's not out of the question.
if you're really so desperate for the ipc to take over penacony blowing up the chessboard isn't a bad idea. start from scratch! that's where the ipc excels, right?
my tears wouldn't stop, and i couldn't see anything. i kept gasping for air until i collapsed in a pool of blood
we've already come this far together. i'd like to join you for the rest of your journey on penacony. i'm pleased that we can finally fight shoulder-to-shoulder -- i couldn't ask for a better ending.
right there, the tallest building in the city. it's also the headquarters of the sky-faring commission. let's hurry. we haven't got much time.
i'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound looked like its winged blade. we've all witnessed it in action before.
perkins is protecting me. i'll be alright. i'm going to leave after i gather up these painkillers.
even without the records of what happened afterward, we know very well that things did not pan out that way. igor's last hope -- the xianzhou alliance -- did not come to his world's rescue.
while that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
well, it depends on how it's used. with just one drop, it's able to numb a patient's body during surgery, making them painless throughout the entire process. however
i dig jokes -- there's just too much sorrow and resentment in the world. sure, jokes won't make the world any better, but they don't make it any worse either.
the heater you saw is just a standard geomarrow radiator. they may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
so, it was the ipc that freed you?
we lived in the same dormitory, went to the same school together every day, ate together, whiled away the time together and occasionally talked about music together -- though it wasn't something she was overly familiar with.
it doesn't look all that impressive from this distance.
that's the spirit! nothing should come between friends. tell me whatever you need, it's on my tab.
of course! it's just i'm better with brawn than brains
haha, just kidding! i love seeing that look on your face. take this key to the tavern cellar. third barrel on the left. you never saw me.
bold of you to assume my appearance betrays my nature.
yes, though not exclusively. just as i extol the "beauty" in this foliage, what i anticipate is an encounter -- a collision and exchange of minds and philosophies.
ah, you're here. get ready, we need to help the infantry lines drive deep into the mine.
it's been such a long time, old friend!
well, we've seen the skysplitter and toured the stargazer navalia. i guess it's time to say goodbye for now.
if you want us to help you persuade your mother, i'm afraid that could be difficult. it's not easy to solve a family dispute as an outsider
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
shh, that's a brave thing to say out in the open if the cloud knights hear you, they won't think twice.
oh? what makes you ask that, young master? i'm happy as long as i get to leave this place.
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
tsk, you think i'd lose to blade?
i admit, seele is talented. we do work well together. but that's all there is to it.
i suppose it is my fault. i should have given him an opportunity already. "a sharp sword can't stay sheathed forever," haha
tsk, the sky-faring commission really made a mess of this -- who knows if we'll ever find all these missing ships.
i'm not the best judge of things but these mirrors
great, then tell your people that aventurine is ready to go in seventeen system hours.
for beings transformed by the abundance, there's a difference. do you know how abominations of abundance and xianzhou people differ?
why are you being so nice all of a sudden? well, since you're not going to check it, i'll take this crate and be on my way. is that okay with everyone?
the soldiers can only periodically clear the fragmentum of monsters. but the monsters will continue to emerge and multiply.
this tragic news would be extremely bad for the family, so they'll be doing everything they can to stop it leaking -- especially to the ipc.
that was over seven hundred years ago. at that time, i was young and also serving as a wardance's ringmaster.
we have no guide and no way of detecting the stellaron. we'll just have to advance gradually and cautiously.
and so elio saw a new future possibility.
the person you're talking about -- are they in charge of the people in black?
the worldly limit of the vidyadhara is reached after seven centuries. they return to the ancient sea and form a shell -- awaiting the next hatching rebirth.
i will seek advice, to prevent something like this from happening again.
i see. maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
so aggressive. are all the robots in the settlement like this?
the trouble with being too good at math is that everyone treats you like a human calculator. so yeah, that's why i rarely talk about my expertise in that area.
stay strong, everyone. we can still do what we can for them starting with finding the murderer.
haha! but a very contented lapdog, i should add! hehe
i suggest we hasten to starskiff jetty and send this judge of the ten-lords commission on her way -- we must continue our own journeys as soon as possible.
er is that so? i feel like the evidence doesn't really match? how about you think it over again?
look who we have here? a lovely young lady.
but i am worried if the heliobus possessing yanqing is too strong, i'm afraid i might not be able to guarantee everyone's safety.
as expected, another change in setting
hey thanks for your concern. you should head back to the town, and i'll do the same when oleg and i are finished.
the outcome of our duel at the alchemy commission is still up in the air. since you're interested, why don't you represent the xianzhou zhuming and challenge me in the ring?
just doing my job. the port has been sealed off, why are you here alone?
that won't be necessary. the crew has nothing to do with the incident, of that i am almost certain. it isn't their intentions that trouble me. all i want is for them to lure out the one we're after.
the biggest giveaway was you comment about my swordplay. correctly guessing the number of swords from the sound alone? you'd have to be more than human.
we reached the required amount by the repayment date. this is the basis for our right to continue negotiations and is a testament to the business viability of aurum alley.
after all, it is a grand event held by the family. the guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.
there are too many discarded things in the sea of stars. our predecessors' trodden paths and forgotten pasts should have left behind vivid marks across the universe.
so your choice is?
finally, we have lady bailu of the alchemy commission. she loves excitement.
by personal request of the committee, a discussion session will be added to allow all participants to raise and answer questions.
i've never had such a dream before. in most dreams, i just go from one mask to another
is it time to warp jump? you go ahead.
not telling yet we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
the reverence to the three talons is complete now we must head for the roots of the arbor.
firstly, the trial of the heart. one needs to acknowledge the pressure in one's heart, and only then can one face it.
i learned my juggling skills on the street -- my brothers taught me. it started out as a way to survive. who'd have thought the performances would become so popular? it feels like fate is teasing us sometimes, hehe.
the last time i came here on a starskiff was let me think about twenty years ago now. i've been on the road for so long that i've started to forget the sights and sounds of the xianzhou
i believe they all have the willpower to start anew, especially after receiving a smile from you, miss robin.
these three tingyun's don't look like they'll be reaching a conclusion anytime soon. we won't be able to get a word in.
some big shot suddenly decided to visit the space station today. everyone has been in a hurry since the announcement. they're all worried that a bad impression could damage madam herta's reputation.
me neither i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
the barrier hasn't been fixed yet. don't try and be a hero, gepard!
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
here, take this, little guest. this gift has been specially prepared for you by the family.
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
i thought so too at the time. but later when grandpa took me around the zhuming's bakeries, we didn't find the same scent anywhere.
seems like we can now continue forward.
that's what friends are for -- don't be a stranger. not everyone in the ipc is driven by pure ambition, y'know~
...speaking of which, i ran into a woman just now who introduced herself as a galaxy ranger. the whole conversation felt off. help me look into her...
this question surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us
it's been pretty peaceful in the underworld recently, so we don't have a lot of use for this stuff anymore. i figured i might as well share it all with the express crew.
the crystals show at least six structures under differing conditions "six-phased ice." the galaxy really is an enigma.
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
"a little" would be an understatement.
that's... dan heng and the security department staff!
seems like someone wants to make things difficult for us. let me see if i can pry it open
who are those two little guys?
oh? which ones might they be? the time i finished off that rampaging prowler with just three bullets? or when i defended the outpost from monsters for six days straight without food or water?
the strategic investment department is well-versed in handling such situations. we can offer the debtor various repayment solutions
i've only been gone, what? a few months? and the space station is already in this state?
what seems to be the problem, friend? it would appear the seals have you at a loss.
hehe, there's no one else here, pela -- no need for such formality.
it could mean something we haven't encountered before is waiting for us. stay on your toes.
i can only say that this incident is an unexpected mess for the girl. the alliance will try to persuade the family to consider this matter carefully during mediation.
you think that adler's discovery drew the enemy's attention.
fu xuan's matrix of prescience was able to go one step further than kafka. to maintain the upper hand, i had to keep it a surprise. i hope this hasn't made you doubt my sincerity?
i will tell it to you straight. i have a strong sense that as a knight of beauty, i have a duty to fight this battle.
as a captain of the silvermane guards, i am duty-bound to carry out the orders of the supreme guardian.
since the family branch from the montour system managed to quash the spread of rumors within a short period of time, the majority of guests were unaware of the situation, and their lives remained largely unaffected.
condolences? well, that's unnecessary.
this is my recommendation. please take your time to consider it.
the halo above your head that symbolizes the harmony -- it's been missing since the moment we reunited.
...the murder isn't nearly enough to disrupt business as usual. even if there were one or two murders on penacony, most people wouldn't be personally affected -- and that won't create any waves.
impressive truly impressive! what a riveting duel! i, giovanni di giorgio, humbly concede!
you're too modest. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall was worth much more than that.
noise? mister gepard uh, an officer in belobog he said something like that too.
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work)
hehe, no need to be so formal. i'm just a tourist here, no different from other tourists who've come to attend the ceremony.
so there's a ring inside. this is evidence, too. why was it planted inside another device?
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment)
you have quite the sense of humor, benefactors i've encountered more trouble with you than i have with the merchant fleet in ten years.
it's a deal then. next time you need something done in the workshop, i'll do it for free!
in the grand fabric of life, both parents are equal, and thus my name combines the surnames of each of my parents.
cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, but the ninja belief in exorcising evil will never change.
regrettably, most languish in ignorance they fail to grasp that while knowledge appears costless, its true value is immeasurable.
we're reinforcements sent by the general. where's everyone else?
well, i'd say that golden theater and the history museum are both worth a look. however, you'd need a pass to get into the museum.
oh? my student? did something happen recently?
as a member of the cloud knights and the general's apprentice, i've had a weight on my shoulders, and i know there's still more to shoulder.
if it can still move, it means it wasn't damaged enough.
if you require resupplying during your journey, you can always count on us.
where did you go? i still haven't seen you grow up big and strong
now that our business on penacony is settled, it's about time we get back on track and prepare for our next warp jump?
what are you doing here? look, if i get into trouble, it's my problem. i don't want to drag you into it.
i'm sure you'll have a great time. don't forget to send my regards to the supreme guardian while you're there.
ugh! chairman carlos of tulas pharmaceuticals, obviously! knock it off with the amateur questions!
very well, then. miss hanya is waiting for you by the suppression towers.
oh hi, i know we haven't got the chance to get acquainted, but i've heard a lot of good things about the crew from the general. i have to say i'm very impressed.
i am deeply disappointed in you, elder. your thoughts and intentions are completely devoid of empathy. cloud knights!
it'll be fine. even if the sky collapses, we have the master diviner with us to hold it up. oh, and now we have the general here too.
they're all just *burning* remembrances a stark contrast to this deep sea.
oh, hey! i'm luka, a member of wildfire. roughing up thugs and protecting the townsfolk is just part of my everyday job.
the scars of that war never truly healed. still, the luofu traced out its arc of recovery, and continued to trade
um, no need. i'll handle the clinic. i assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
mister sunday has done some serious research on his suspects... this traitor must have been causing trouble for the family for a long time.
...it seems like i'm too old to qualify for that.
it's just two hundred but i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
huh, so everyone saw the same thing? i remember it was a room, and then through a mirror, i came to a long hallway
there's no time to talk about this. the wardance has already started! if my guess is correct, the borisin will most likely use the ceremony to begin their slaughter.
just some shallow intuition anyway, let's report back to the sheriff for now.
i read that a stellaron's internal fluctuations will cause a fragmentum to appear.
that sounds kinda weird
let's go. we'll head straight for the finale and take our final bow in this farewell performance.
speaking of living in the shadows, there's probably not much difference between us. it's only polite to reveal your true self, at least when speaking to others...
cloud-piercer is always with me. for my safety, and the safety of everyone else.
tsk, tsk, little pawn, must you force me to intervene directly? i'm loath to flout my philosophy of destruction.
a person is defined by their actions alone i think that's how the saying goes? if the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
if there's anything i can do for you, don't hesitate to ask.
we are not completely out of options.
did destiny's slave make you do it?
you're a smart merchant, old oti. isn't the whole purpose of this elaborate game to showcase your business acumen and seek more benefits for the family?
(when it comes to minor details, march's logic is actually pretty good.)
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
ever since you encountered those borisin spies, you've been so busy that you've hardly eaten anything. you can't defeat hoolay on an empty stomach.
are you suggesting that the dreammaster wasn't the one controlling the stellaron?
do you remember what you did to our last snowmobile?
i grow flowers, *sigh* it's just that i'm not very good at it.
don't look at me. he's the one who came up with this idea. it's up to you to accept it or not, svarog.
of course. i respect my performers' wishes. which academy would you like your role to be in?
so now, i'll become a cunning speck of dust and make those masterminds behind the curtains
if i may be so bold to ask, is this borisin truly that formidable?
sadly, i can't. too much work on the space station.
outworlder girl in a strange new land, came to perform and make her stand~
you saw for yourself -- after he pushed everyone back, he disappeared. it was clear: he didn't have any interest in the vein itself.
oh, are you implying that the ipc was setting a trap for the merchant guild?
the address will be held at everwinter monument. i hope the three of you can find time to attend.
ah cute mimic snow slug.
i will stay for a while longer. lady asta has recently expressed concerns regarding disturbances on the space station. conclusion: extended observation is necessary.
if it involves helping people in need, count me in too.
i hereby ask all parties to submit your support documents for evaluation. the documents should include scope of business, ratio of contributions, and registered capital.
you scared me! when did you pop out?
oh, right! if you're gonna go find lynxy, you gotta know what she looks like!
mister gepard, i've always been hoping to fight you. there's no one in the overworld more worth challenging than you.
sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? all these hallways really look the same to me...
because i wanted to change myself.
let's get something to eat while we walk.
ugh, i'm not that big of a baddie you know
this is so her style, isn't it?
after all these years, i never thought i'd set eyes on this guitar again. *sigh* guess we're stuck with each other
how much longer can you last with your current supplies?
no one can reverse this outcome. not you, not the nameless, nor any power in the galaxy.
the cloud knights will carry out an investigation, but for now our most pressing matter is to put a stop to phantylia's scheme.
so you're thinking of turning the express into a combat unit? personally i'd only use it for logistics
ravings of a drunken miner is a little harsh.
how long does she plan on staying?
i'm here for the watchmaker's legacy... and that's it. i think i've been honest enough.
i can guess why: general feixiao is just too strong.
i made some progress too. the miners here say they've noticed some people acting strangely recently - a few vagrants who almost never leave the great mine have suddenly started making trips to boulder town.
i prefer the beggar over the rich man. the rich have no idea what they're after in life, but the beggar? those folks -- they know exactly what they want.
when i was younger, i didn't know what weariness was. even at night, i was restless. i'd always drag my brother along to count the stars. the more stars i counted, the more energetic i got
well, it's time for me to get on out of here. after all, we already made a nice little fortune on this trip.
cirrus the only one who may have knowledge of tail's whereabouts is cirrus whose plans were foiled due to tail's actions.
if it were me i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
among the vidyadhara, the high elder is the existence closest to the permanence.
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
i've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
of course not. two senior members of wildfire duking it out in the fight club? that would be bad form.
let us save such reminiscence for later, shall we?
little misha and old mikhail's homeland having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
she taught me the skills with a blade, but we never became close *sigh* in an endless night, there is nothing closer than the bright moon, always hanging in the sky.
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
(imposter? i see. she gave my whereabouts to someone who is tracking acheron too.)
with all this in mind, firefly and her companion -- there should only be one -- have entered this corridor together.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
the funds will be used for the overall repair and upgrade of the dock which means we won't be able to use the dock's shipping logistics for a while.
keeping such a conspicuous piece of art around wouldn't go unnoticed the thieves must have disassembled it and hidden the parts inside the robots.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
i wonder how their relationship is now.
hah, it's been a while since i heard that anyone was pleased to meet anyone, haha. i won't forget you in a hurry. wildfire welcomes you.
i shall treat it as a vacation and enjoy the scenery of fyxestroll garden -- though i must admit, the wind here does chill the bones.
this is a long hallway is it just me, or is this hotel too big for its own good?
i've captured the nature of the medicine in my censer.
i'm jealous that you get to travel with people as interesting as march and dan heng!
what should we see next? do we just follow the express tour route?
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
looks like you've been keeping an eye on the skysplitter. have you noticed anything unusual?
thank you, and may the beauty always be with you!
this actually confirms a theory that i've always had: it seems like inquisition spirits are a creation of the erudition.
hahaha, you two make a cute pair! anyway, i'd better be on my way, see you next time!
seeing as you're right here in front of me like this, then i guess the answer is "a trashcan," right?
it's time to go see what this criminal the ipc wants so bad is made of!
yanqing would never draw his sword on me to prove himself. i have confidence in him.
mister alfalfa, let's not forget that the ipc controls the biggest interstellar publicity platform. more than half the news networks in the universe take their orders from us.
are you alright? are you hurt anywhere? do you feel dizzy? tired? or
so, have you thought things through?
no. does that have to do with the monsters? perhaps the madam guardian will be familiar.
that's the second time you've evaded the possibility of a battle you really do want to change my prediction, don't you
just come back once in a while. you will always be welcome at the space station -- just don't stay for too long.
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within the stellaron.
if that's the case, i should thank you for protecting my mentor by exiling her, general.
however, all stories come to an end, just as they disappeared from the spotlight long ago.
they're a band of do-gooders who sprung up to maintain order in the underground. after the silvermane guards withdrew, wildfire set up shop.
as soon as herta got bored, she forgot about the whole thing, but all her research was recorded in screwllum's database. silver wolf retrieved it when she hacked into planet screwllum
but he's not the only evil ninja in this realm, right?
don't be disheartened. the stronger the fragmentum contamination, the closer we are to the source.
it is through fear of punishment that i am choosing to surrender. the galaxy is a vast place, but i am merely a wanderer. it would be silly of me to think i could outrun the alliance.
and patience happens to be one of my greatest strengths. so now, do you understand what you must give up, miss samuel? or should i address you as
a lot of the researchers on the station live off the stuff. they said it helps them focus.
ode to fool this must be the second act.
you'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
i'm sorry, but that simply isn't possible. aether editing isn't capable of destroying an entire universe.
do you feel any closer to becoming the great hero you've always dreamed of?
it's like weaving brocade -- you and i can only add one gold thread each time, but eventually, we will make a gorgeous pattern.
i've heard that a skilled masked fool received an invitation too that must be you, right? did you enjoy yourself?
we won't make things anymore complicated than they need to be. we just want to listen in on the questioning.
mm, that is clear to me now. friends of the astral express, i have brought someone with me whom i think you'll be eager to see.
every time i head out, i leave a letter behind and lock it in the drawers of my shop. if i come back, then i'll burn it later. if i don't then it'll be something for others to remember me by.
that drink has a fair amount of memoria in it, intended to make dreams more vivid and pleasant, but instead it caused your anxiety to be amplified, eventually triggering serious hallucinations.
w--what's the big deal!? i find joy in my work, and my life is is pretty fulfilling!
leave your contact details with me. when i've completed my assessment of the pharmacology, i'll get in touch with you.
us silvermane guards have fought against the fragmentum for far too long and have lost too much even though you've solved the stellaron problem for now, the number of casualties is still staggering.
we're done. either stop talking, or disappear from my sight.
this is the only advice i have for you, from someone burdened with a blood debt.
the restricted zone front line is on the other side of the gear bridge. it's an endless fragmentum with a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
whoa! you're so patient -- you really peeled off all the layers!
take it from someone on the other side of your so-called river: you know better than i do that penacony has already deviated from the harmony. whatever your intentions may be... i foresee only one outcome.
gepard, look! the miners have put up a makeshift defensive line!
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
back in this office again the last time i was here was the last time i was here.
this seal was already on the verge of breaking before the ambrosial arbor's resurrection.
over seven centuries ago, i followed my mentor on a campaign against the abominations, and i personally witnessed the devastation on the battlefield after hoolay appeared.
talent? you'd be dead if it weren't for those two travelers. do you think stealing a starskiff and taking to the skies is a show of talent? what about being trapped by abominations?
fortunately, while the path of the order governs all things, it can't affect the nihility. i came to realize this when the dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
will you stand with me by the window a little while? no need to talk
if yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
i've always thought of you that way.
now that i think about it perhaps i was too naive. she'd probably forgotten it even existed.
that's the communication module doing its job -- herta often speaks of it as an expensive and impractical function. she often shuts it off to increase calculating power.
we're sorry for all the trouble our check-in seems to have caused. might i ask for your name?
ninja hiryu is right. since i have already relinquished the super ninja scroll, i'll rely on my fists to awaken these ninja initiates that succumbed to the way of the fiendling.
i know all that i wish to know. thank you, miss huanxi.
as you know, there are infinite worlds in this universe that can be similar yet different from each other in various ways. the same is true of the people on those worlds.
what's a little blatant engineering in the opening sequence, won't you agree?
i, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
oops, not to your liking huh sorry, i'll treat you to a nice meal once we get back to reality.
as soon as i finish my paperwork for the day, i will make my way to fyxestroll garden. please, go ahead of me.
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
but please believe me that in that monochrome world, there will be a glimpse of fleeting red, and when you make a choice, it will reappear before you once more...
no, hold on -- you have a stellaron within you. i think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. it might be dangerous if you stay for too long
miss seele! phew, it's a good thing you showed up when you did. my heartfelt thanks~
a reward won't be necessary. i'm only acting according to my way of the ninja. riches are not what i desire.
that's why he asked for our help he didn't want to let anyone else find out that blade had already escaped!
you are forbidden from leaving the sky-faring commission until the aforementioned questions have been investigated.
there are many types of people called "heroes," and he is among the most genuine... i have seen many such people come and go.
a dreamweaving class will start soon at dreamweaver academy. it's more a part of the anniversary celebrations than it is a regular class.
you've met her many times, now. what's your impression of miss acheron?
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
but before you leave, i have one last request to make. the garrison is heading down to the underworld soon to survey the situation around boulder town. why don't you come with me?
thank you for your help, general. let's get going!
the crowd never gets tired, do they?
alright then. tell me, what kind of organization are the galaxy rangers?
elio ordered sam and me to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
pretending to use your dad again as an excuse if he knew about this, you'd be in big trouble.
come on, let's see if that guard over there will let us past.
i still have some paperwork that needs attending to -- once i am finished, i will make my way to fyxestroll garden without delay.
it seems like the craftsmen are too afraid to go in, but they have nowhere to run to either. we should take care, benefactors -- something terrible must have happened.
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
you're belobog's hero -- i'm sure you must be popular in the underworld. the silvermane guards will face less resistance if you come with us.
i'm afraid by the time we find him, half of penacony will have been sent back to reality by sparkle
the sea of stars is vast and our journeys are difficult and long. please look after yourself, no matter where you are.
am i allowed to refuse? this place just looking around gives me a headache.
a good answer, short and to the point. it would seem i've been unsuccessful in de-tangling myself of matters thus far
what makes you think you can convince me?
then it likely has something to do with the watchmaker's invite.
it's been a while, madam jade. i'm honored to have the opportunity to work with you.
i just got a whiff of it, and it woke me right up. it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission!
sounds like i'll be out of the action for a while. finally, a chance to kick back and relax?
something on your mind? let's talk about it.
we should have enough clues here to get diting on the move.
penacony isn't all bad, right? i'll use this interesting experience as a talking point at the poker table.
however, now that more powers in the universe are aware of this secret, the situation in the cosmos will become more complicated.
i asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. no one asked you to criticize my dear old mettle!
on the logistics side, we can reduce costs by making sure the delivery routes are planned efficiently.
reality cruises on in serenity, while undercurrents bubble up from the dreamscape just like that memokeeper said
so what happened to baiheng in the end?
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
hmm? are you talking to me? if you're not one of the long-life species, then i guess we're around the same age. is there something you need?
let's head back, otherwise mister svarog and pascal will get worried.
the way i see it, he was always a healer. it's just that ordinary healers focus on one patient at a time, while he wanted to cure the ailments of all the people on the xianzhou.
fair lady, if you're intent on taking away this person... this sword that is under my protection, please engage me with a fair duel according to knightly etiquette.
are you a witch!? just how did you manage to convince them in the blink of an eye that we're some kind of detectives
i know what fu xuan is thinking of, so i must make her wait. if she is patient enough to wait, then that would be the time.
with respect to this incident, what is your plan for posting on the luofu's ghostly grove? since it concerns the seat of divine foresight, i am hoping you could
you must already have some ideas. let them out.
there's no need to covet an illusory sky in dreams, because we have the right and the ability to fly towards a broader horizon.
understood, ninja hiryu aoi dan heng.
i have an idea -- how about we all just pretend that i've been possessed by a sleep ghost, let me sleep for another ten hours, and then call it a day's work?
she's acting just like seele did the first time she saw a real plains bear
those stellaron hunters they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
the reason you don't remember is that i wiped your memory before the operation at herta space station.
but as the luofu ringmaster, there are things i must uphold.
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
no, no, only an extra couple of hours~
i'm sorry, i'm not ready to talk to anyone about the reasons behind my decision i hope you can understand.
oh thanks, but no thanks. i can't stand moving at someone else's pace.
*sigh* it seems like the idiocy index here is no better than it is out there.
seems like the smoke is getting thinner
a toast to history that no longer remains silent, the passionate and courageous pursuit, and a voyage that traverses the stars.
this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
sorry, i should've stepped in.
oh, i guess miss sparkle has written herself into the skit here, and this has nothing to do with the actual case. goldhammer -- is that her real surname?
the foxians and the vidyadhara have their own ceremonies. foxian soldiers place their dead in starskiffs and then let them drift out into the stars. they call it "the returning."
i can feel your obvious excitement that means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
but lady bronya values your talent, and she sees how much you could contribute to the rejuvenation of belobog so i came to talk to you about it.
after we fled to boulder town, i made up my mind: a tragedy like that could never be allowed to happen again. that's why i gathered oleg and the others together, and created the first sparks of wildfire.
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
wha-- i didn't mean to bring her along! the smoke was too dense, i was in a daze! before i knew it, i'd somehow dragged her down here too.
anyway, i should get back to work here's hoping you keep on winning.
master kucha, do i count as a "ninja initiate" now?
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that
stand down, moze. i am here, hoolay. what do you wish to say?
the wisdom and experience you've accumulated over ten amber eras are truly impressive.
b--but it would be my pleasure! "kindness" is sampo koski's middle name. follow me, friends, and keep quiet. we don't want to be spotted by the guards.
no, i'm still going to melt down this sword!
seeing as we're all on the same side, there's no reason to delay. let's go, i've arranged for a guide to take you to svarog.
you're right. even though i'm not a fan, i'll help you figure something out.
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
i suppose it all depends on whether you support his understanding of and devotion to the beauty.
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
this man on the wanted list he's a stellaron hunter, right? is that?
i'm wondering though, are there any restrictions against, uh "aliens" like me from boarding the train?
ah is that so? apologies.
today i just realized i misheard her. i think she actually said: "the edge may break, but the heart remains" probably.
it was me who accepted the bet. you're not involved at all
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
if someone has chosen these victims deliberately first a smuggler, then a family celebrity then this murderer's motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.
get serious. i've no time for games. let's head back. the hint is probably in that prominent sandpit.
who are you? i don't remember you.
this business tactic is what i call a "bait and switch." pretty clever, huh?
dreammaster, it's just to prove that the charmony festival has nothing to do with the stellaron. if we're being overly cautious i will return to the stage to offer tribute in song, just per the arrangement.
the flickering tongues of duke inferno's fire carry a certain property, and this property is the secret behind spontaneous human combustion.
the opponent for that fight was too weak. they went down with just a few punches. i don't know what got into luka after that, but he said out loud that he wanted seele to come up and fight him right there and then
sure do! y'know, i was racking my brains before i boarded the express, but now i've got more ideas than i know what to do with. inspiration is a fickle mistress.
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
the item that's supposed to be in this exhibit is a modern sculpture called gears and wisdom.
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
see if you can calm them down. don't get aggressive. just make it clear that the xianzhou luofu has no intention of violating their rights.
you mean that someone else got here and took everything before us?
and if you're feeling a little tired, lie down on the seats instead. the universe is fascinating from every angle.
mister gallagher seems to be getting at something.
are you suggesting that there are borisin here at stargazer navalia, right now?
wherever they lead, it must be the end of the journey.
oh, i'm afraid i'm not built for hard labor
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
the food hawkers are thriving, but dock operations and other businesses are stretched to the breaking point.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
how do you ipc cronies have the audacity to fight cloud knights? you practically assaulted law enforcement officers.
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
sorry, it's so noisy here... i wanted to find somewhere quieter where i could get your feedback, but...
and yet she decided to challenge its power -- a power beyond human comprehension. supreme guardian cocolia sacrificed herself to dispel the dark clouds enveloping this city.
if what mister norbert said is true, then our safest option is to send a civilian to try to reach out to mister cold feet and lure him out of his lair.
as for our astral friends i hereby formally welcome you all to join our operation to seal the stellaron.
but from the encrypted message on the invite, and the family's reaction the former is more likely.
please speak candidly. depending on what you say, we could very well ask you to disembark.
objects that have been exposed to fragmentum corrosion might not be stable. i wouldn't touch that device if i were you.
i've been so focused on the station's defenses recently -- it's easy to forget that work-life balance is the best way to stay on top.
we meet again, my dear
it wouldn't be possible with a normal pathstrider.
i didn't expect her to be so open-minded and she didn't even try to persuade me to stay. she didn't summon me just to return the guitar, did she?
if she asks you, just let her know my reasoning. she'll understand.
by the way, what did you do to that man earlier? it was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.
hmm sounds like you know a lot about him?
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
quite a fascinating contraption. i would rate it more favorably if that clamorous little person inside were gone.
why do i wield my sword? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
haha, he's my little brother, of course i don't want to leave him alone. but i don't have any other choice.
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
i never leave a question unanswered. i am a ninja, aka rappa.
the weeds in my garden give me more grief.
you're all done? did it go smoothly?
leave the battle to us, you need to fall back!
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
from the sound of it, it seems like you're asking me to leave penacony.
i won't let anyone ruin the reputation of luka strongarm!
the illustrious merlin's claw waiting for me, and for so long, too? it's quite an honor. it's been a while, general feixiao.
these uninvited guests keep talking about "asset evaluation," whatever that means. all i know is they're seriously disrupting the lives of the underworlders!
this vein so this is what everyone is fighting over
i've dispatched a messenger to send word, madam cocolia will be aware of your arrival. come with me.
yes, the doctor has assured me of your noble character. he considers you, like himself, a virtuous person who can be trusted by the family.
there's nothing more to say, gepard. the decision is yours.
we don't have much time. if i were you, i'd make a move before it's too late.
uh? he didn't send you all here?
is there anything else in your "script" about me? i'd like to know what kind of footnote "i" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?
pascal, i'm going to change your shell. don't worry, it won't hurt
however, unlike you stellaron hunters or the astral express, we band together merely to obtain what we want.
how about a divination?
the older, the rarer! plus, you had to enter that ruin for it -- even more special
very well. i will await all of you at the ferry.
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
hold on. let's listen in on their conversation first.
together, they did something bad -- something terrible. it led to horrific consequences.
*sigh* we still don't have anywhere near enough.
you see, i'm selling this stellaron to bring food to my dear family -- or we'll all have to starve tonight. so, be a good chap and do me a favor, will you?
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
so... is this my final destination, the land of the dead?
however, i've always wondered
elder huaiyan is still that tricky general who likes to give everyone a headache.
it heartens me to learn that everyone is willing to put aside their differences for penacony's plight. i trust that everyone will surely reach consensus in the upcoming negotiations.
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
aaaand in addition to the coupons, you can get a visiograph of bailu, our alley ambassador!
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player
but what about those simply struggling for survival, fighting for something better? i've witnessed their light on the front lines, in the underworld in places you have overlooked.
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise
not necessarily but i have my reasons for wanting to investigate. what was he doing in the days leading up to the ambrosial arbor's resurrection?
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
oh, that~ it's a botanical specimen -- little lynxy sent it during one of her research trips.
you know, the cruelty has never claimed victory. me, caiyi, your father guangyuan we were prepared for the worst when we enlisted.
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because
the xianzhou need brawny warriors with their swords and spears, as well as unpredictable waters like her who travels freely and unrestrained.
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
careful, they're waiting for us to get close enough to reveal our weak spots.
haha, there's no fooling the astral express!
fine, let's smash these metal cans first, then we can talk!
i'll leave negotiations to you guys. they're not my strong point.
i've wondered at times what the luofu should give the nameless in return for their great deeds
come onnnn~ together is better!
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
so what did luocha get up to during those missing two hours?
confidence goes a long way.
first we have the underworld -- a huge underground space. miners have built towns here and are excavating geomarrow.
mm that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
you speak too highly of us, welt. the stellaron hunters are merely destiny's slaves.
probability: member #sixty-four, doctor primitive, may appear.
i wonder if you've ever heard of a creature called a "heliobus"? it loves to feed on human emotions and memories, and excels at manipulating its hosts.
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
come to think of it, i didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
looks like your disguise has helped you successfully understand every facet of the family.
this is why i wish to befriend all of you. a place where nightmares and sweet dreams intersect the perfect cradle for the remembrance.
ever since the destruction sowed stellarons across the universe, many worlds have changed.
jade is looking for me? i'll contact her in five minutes.
hmph, it'll take more than that. but you're not as bad as i took you for. you walk the talk.
perhaps you'll be the first guest to meet the dreammaster in years, mister yang.
the merlin's claw of the xianzhou yaoqing?
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten complicated.
you know that i'm a descendant of the luofu vidyadhara. in scalegorge waterscape, you witnessed my "secret strength," as march would call it
when you see this, do you remember anything?
exactly. that's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
i know that this is an illusion created by a heliobus. the general sent me to assist the ten-lords commission -- i know a thing or two about your work
don't trouble yourself about it. we need to find her.
all i know is that i must achieve glory for belobog!
i understand. i'm counting on you!
but if he fled towards the interior of the ship it'll be hard to track him down over such a vast area.
fancy running into you two again! what a pleasant surprise~
merely a wanderer? you're too modest, luocha. do i need to remind you of your actions at the eternity fortress and the shroudveil starzone?
that doesn't sound like the kind of comment a galaxy ranger would make.
yeah, miss huohuo has been trying to track down tail -- in addition to helping the squad, that is.
that was my first time seeing you in battle you've got some moves, don't you? no wonder you were able to save the underworld.
i made a promise to mister oleg to save as many people as possible. i have to see to it myself.
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would
i believe everyone here is familiar with the general contents of the proposal. after this round of financing, the ipc is expected to hold thirty% of penacony's shares.
ah, a matter that requires capable people such as yourselves. we captured a member of the stellaron hunters a few days ago, who goes by the name of "blade."
and that's how the clash started. now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
cut the act. you're perfectly aware of the point i'm making.
first, the disciples of sanctus medicus grew uninterrupted on the luofu, yet the six charioteers were not aware of it. that was a dereliction of duty.
just as my heart is driven by joy, the one and only was but a fist's distance away when it crashed into the express' rear.
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
the fragmentum corrosion is weaker here... i wonder what's controlling it?
which causes your sword's song to become somewhat mumbled at the end.
to be honest, i don't know when pom-pom appeared i think it was before i came to the express? no wait, maybe it was after
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
the footprints, which are half as big as standard, must belong to a pepeshi person.
because of the difficult situation we were in, we formed a temporary alliance to help the residents of the underworld resolve a few issues of survival.
not only that, we've also established contact with the garden of recollection through the ipc, and they've pledged their support for our research endeavors
remember my adoptive parents i mentioned to you a while ago?
seems it's just one wild ride after another
apologies, this isn't the best time to discuss such matters. let's focus on the festive spirit for now. i wish you the best of luck.
haha, looks like our nameless friend over here is still confused. let me explain.
it'll be too late for regrets then let's defeat this one here.
my bad. well, since you went through the entire ambrosial arbor crisis firsthand, dan heng and lieutenant yanqing, i'd like to discuss something with you.
ah, they agreed, but it'll be some time before they arrive.
space racing is a battle of bravery and speed. when the engine's power reaches its peak, one's passionate fighting spirit will also be ignited.
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
just think about it. if i had a weapon that powerful in the palm of my hand, i could take on a hundred fragmentum monsters at once!
that's why i rejoice at my broken wings.
that's right. we heard the anniversary celebration had been delayed, so we wrapped up the conference early and came straight here to see if we could catch the fun.
i wouldn't want general jing yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
had the reignbow arbiter not descended and destroyed the enemy's assault with their sky-shattering lux arrow, who's to say whether the luofu would still be here today?
aurum alley should embrace change, as its residents do.
are we missing the forest for the trees here? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
you heard the call and knew that i truly did need your help, so why are you hesitating?
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
i believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his nameless friends. similarly, i'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
for my safety? are these buttons something dangerous?
i understand but we don't need to disassemble the cargo if it's just a security check, right?
yes. it's strange for a fugitive to give themselves up, but a fugitive who can see the future? for her, perhaps that was the way it was always going to be
the key question is when did he leave? there's only one gate in this area, at least on the map miss jingyan, does the remaining footage show anyone else entering or leaving this place?
it wasn't until i held guyun in my hands that i could sense its thoughts and unspoken words.
even if the crisis on the luofu had nothing to do with the stellaron, i would be willing to help but i can't speak for the other members of my crew.
you wanna know what happens to people who vandalize exhibits? i call the silvermane guards and they carry you away!
by the way, there's one more thing.
calenga abyss what does she expect to find there? current research on leviathan merely proves how little we know about such life forms
i've gotta say, aetherium wars is really fun, i've been grinding for several days straight -- barely even had time to eat!
yingxing, imbibitor lunae you've been running for too long. it's time to go back to the shackling prison!
*sigh* anyway, what took you so long?
what do you make of this painting? i'm no expert, but just from the artist's strokes i can tell it's no ordinary piece.
based on your description, that lord ravager was indeed cunning. her demeanor mirrored mine so closely that it felt like she was living my life for a few days rather than merely disguising herself.
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool and it seems like a stunt they'd pull
we are putting our dearest baby sister in your hands this time. let us know immediately if anything happens.
no. if the general isn't available, i'll come back another day.
a little stool that seems quite normal. there are two small footprints drawn on it in crayon.
let's get back to the main topic. the name that came to my mind, was svarog.
really? don't tell me you're not craving a little vengeance.
what are you, a mob boss?
i have no interest in commenting on the deeds and sins of imbibitor lunae. given the choice, i would like to cast his name aside even so, the consequences of his power will be borne by me alone.
that's what we're about to witness on the radiant feldspar.
i'm on duty. let's catch up later.
while words can be deceiving, your gaze, your breathing, and your scent they reveal more than your words do.
a probability? yes, it exists, but it verges on the infinitesimal. to phrase it in a manner more befitting the vernacular of penacony, "you're dreaming."
you sound very sure of yourself. looks like you've already convinced that chicken wing boy from the family.
despite your determined attitude, the issues plaguing penacony are real, are they not?
sure you don't wanna reconsider? it's not too late to change your mind!
i see well, thank you for being sincere. in itself, it's a comfort to me.
yep, they're tailing us right now. why not go and talk to them it'll take the spotlight off me, being constantly stared at is really uncomfortable.
even if cirrus doesn't know where tail is, given the shared history, they wouldn't hesitate to cause trouble
the only things that can stop such negative emotions are rationality and responsibility. this is a valuable lesson i've learned from mister svarog.
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
that may be so, but still i prefer settling things with a sword than you know
think you've got her all figured out, do you? that's exactly what she wants you to think! trust me, she's so cunning she could even outwit herself!
let's walk and talk -- this way!
the general has no need to show his martial prowess with me around. since he acknowledges my strength, i need to help shoulder his burdens that much more!
okay, then i'll go set up the stove. if you have any questions, just ask me.
(when it comes to minor details, march can be very logical. as for the rest of the story)
wait, three? there is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? wait it's
*sigh* never mind. this is your space, and i shouldn't intrude. i've got business to take care of. bye for now.
according to lieutenant yanqing's report, he stumbled upon a few suspicious foxians at stargazer navalia. after following them, he discovered that they were actually borisin in disguise. this is one of the bodies.
"our reincarnation's greatest cost, the wisdom of a past life lost, yet through the teachings of our kind, unto the young again consigned."
the master diviner asked us to pass on this item of tingyun's. i'll go to the palace of astrum and meet with yukong. if neither of you has anything urgent, it'd be best if you came too.
these memory fragments are as fine as dust, and can't form memory bubbles. they're hard to see with the naked eye -- even most memokeepers can't sense them.
i ran into a wizened lady there. she was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
well, everyone, elder huaiyan and i have some business to discuss. for now, yanqing, why don't you entertain our guests and take miss yunli to the inn?
after jumping from the express, i shall pierce the wall of the giant sting's stomach. it should then violently convulse so the express can escape the confines of its body.
oh i understand now. you're referring to aventurine's cornerstone right? sorry, compared to him, my ability is not as "visual."
i'm at your service. i will not disappoint.
march said something like that at first, too.
the result has invariably been that they "can't".
that's not what i was going to say.
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
we're wasting our words, march. at least one thing is clear: we mustn't be caught.
wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. like i said, you can think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground.
i'd like to ask: did you really not know of the stellaron's existence?
alright, i get it! i'm setting off right now. i'll have to trouble you to look after them while i'm gone, ma'am.
i know, right? i did a lot of research before i decided to film here
you were closely watching me, weren't you? and if i sought help from anyone, your people would kill them was that your plan, hoolay?
someone brought a stellaron into the xianzhou and planted it among the roots of the ambrosial arbor. they wish to resurrect it and achieve their hidden goal through external aggression.
i must be hearing things: paving a convenience? shouldn't i be saying this to you instead?
yes, it's none other than you, ninja actor.
we're too late. looks like we'll have to catch the replay later on
why would someone as talented as the master diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
i think it'd be best to pay a visit to serval landau.
there are also the yaoqing, the fanghu, the zhuming, the xuling, and the yuque.
this handwritten fan reply card!
she advised me to trust the younger generation's abilities and let them lead. her predictions, it appears, have come true.
i have a preference for thick, crusty baguettes. slice them thinly so they're easier to store -- a crucial snack for extended voyages.
you sure know a lot, mister luocha.
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
there's no time. i'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the memory zone.
come on! one more -- and make it challenging!
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards we didn't meet seele until way later.
but if you're interested, there's a shop selling jade abacus jewelry in starskiff haven -- i can show you around when i'm free.
don't worry about your mission. you have me here too, right? i know my grandfather said that you must "represent the luofu as the ringmaster," but don't let that intimidate you.
what about you, miss silvermane? you're the only one here that isn't compelled to do or die with svarog. i'd like to hear your plan.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
of course! for your safety, i want to ensure that everything you see is manageable. i don't want you to lose your mind in the simulation!
kid, you've really gotta stop making promises to children never mind. he'll just pawn his iron arm if he loses, and take you up there out of his own pocket.
do you see that mechanical gear bridge? when you cross over to the other side, you arrive at hell on earth.
well, that's out of my hands. it will just prove that i'm still the same person
is it that obvious?
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
given the type of person she is, if she did have any clues, she would seek out our help. if she hasn't shared anything with us, it means there is only one possibility.
their aspirations are well-founded. the xianzhou does indeed harbor the secret to becoming immortal. i admire you, so i thought i'd give you the chance to obtain it.
interesting. let's see what happened next.
hang on. i'm confused here lefton wright? is this some kind of joke?
luka was a fast learner. at first, i couldn't figure out if he liked what i was teaching him -- fighting, weapons, strategy, etc. he didn't talk a lot -- just kept his head down.
if they hadn't identified it, i bet all the shops and hotels in the vicinity would have had to close down by now.
so if you're planning on going, i can't go with you.
didn't little yanqing claim that he was going to give up being the ringmaster and go on the hunt instead? help shoulder the general's burdens?
you won't slow us down. and you should be able to shut down the elevators from the master control zone, right?
hold your horses, cowboy. it's for those to decide.
but after thinking it over, the only thing that could be considered equal value is the bond i have with all of you.
but stargazer navalia is the shipbuilding port of the xianzhou luofu. if the sky-faring commission called for a lockdown, there should be official documents proving it, right?
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
th--that's it -- you did it! this alone should prove to everyone that you are the true high elder.
hmm a fugitive would still have to rely on starskiffs to travel between different delves.
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
could it have something to do with that clockie that only you can see?
i remember the conductor telling me that himeko's coffee had a special aroma. if caffeine didn't mess with my sleeping pattern so much, i'd ask her for the recipe.
not only that, putting spices supreme on the map would increase interest in the alley as a whole.
take a good look at your pocket. your friend has already given you the answer.
(that's the thing about dreams -- anything can feel familiar.)
next time you try to bluff like that, at least make it convincing.
you don't talk like a cook, you sound more like a tv host or something.
i wonder should i ask somebody here to modify my hand a bit and make it more powerful?
all we need to do is bring those disillusioned fans back to their senses to quell the rogue waves of fiendlings.
so i was the only one kept in the dark then.
just what crime did you commit exactly? they recalled a bunch of guards from the front line to track you down -- it's unprecedented. now they're patrolling the whole city and everyone's in a panic.
never mind that. the monkey you sold us keeps running off on its own. are you sure it's just a toy?
(plausible -- looking at the map, this place is well-hidden.)
the arbiter-generals concluded that phantylia did not intend for you to survive. if utilized strategically, this could give the alliance an element of surprise.
i think i found the source of the problem. you replaced the rollers, but the bearing is causing a jam -- there's a misalignment.
thank you, miss topaz. we're on our way to the hounds to verify some intel. perhaps you've had dealings with them?
we shouldn't run into any problems with you around. even if they see through the harmony's power of disguise, there'll be a way for us to escape.
of course. to honor martial arts, the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
such collaboration between organic lifeforms is magnificent and efficient -- you're rebuilding the space station far quicker than i could have imagined.
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
apologies. herta did not mention this to me.
finished warming up? now it's my turn
an aesthetic you share, miss acheron.
perhaps there's an issue with its language module. this little guy probably can't understand what we're saying either
behold, the winner of the "most awesome researcher" contest.
we heard about miss firefly from black swan but we never expected miss robin to
you don't have to answer me now. sit on it for a while. when the time is right, i will look for you again.
that healer seems to be a senior colleague of sushang's but i heard that he's even more energetic than she is! maybe everyone from the yaoqing is that way?
i know you can hide your appearance, but trespassing on restricted family grounds is still a bold move.
there is something else he cares more about and needs -- or should i say, is verifying.
you're too kind my oversight.
you're just in time -- everyone is asking this ipc goon for an explanation!
i've never really seen this side of him before the more you learn.
do we have any other choice? i am starting to feel a little worn out, though
very well, the charmony festival is about to commence soon. take advantage of this unique opportunity, a blend of work and play is essential for superior knowledge absorption.
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition
alright, it's time for the duel! just go fight that skott guy! i've got something else to do, so i'll be off.
the longer one works as a judge, the more they understand one fact -- of all the people in this world, none is without blemish.
what i'm trying to say is -- i think luocha may have friends on the luofu, and they're using the title page to communicate.
i never knew your guitar had a connection to me too. quite the story.
everyone, this is captain dunn, an old friend of mine. he used to be an ace on the keys in the band.
sampo, do you know the landau siblings?
not to take away from the supreme guardian in front of me hehe, she's quite the inspiring leader as well.
need to take stock? just say the word -- we'll head over together.
well, i heard you have some experience with archery and martial arts. the first thing we're going to do is see just how strong your fundamentals are.
what do you mean? it's improbable that you've crossed paths with my past self... what i mean is, there is nothing left to retrace there -- only nihility.
looks like we're not the only ones who wanted afternoon tea today though. we'll have to stand up for the time being.
we both still have our own paths to walk. so let's forge ahead. hopefully, if we meet again... it'll be beneath clear skies.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
thank you. in the name of the preservation, i promise we'll do everything we can to save lives.
see you around, pal don't let me down.
no need to explain! this is professor capote's autograph alright, but you can't hide your handwriting. the way you join your letters is no different to your childhood diary entries.
yes, despite its recent calamity, penacony remains a top-quality asset within the cosmos, with good credit, lucrative potential, and promising prospects.
just my conjecture, but i doubt it's far from the truth. my brother mentioned that they've had to use extreme measures to repel the fragmentum monsters.
oh no, xianzhou divination is nothing like the superstitious scams you see elsewhere. it's based on a technology called the jade abacus.
sweet dreams soda?
it's just that their trickery runs deeper than i thought. robin's stand-in was all ready to go... these two murders are definitely getting hushed up.
yeah surely we've earned it?
march. your master has dropped out of the contest. this is a great opportunity for you to stick your neck out!
but i can't just stand by and watch mister gopher wood become an enemy of the harmony. i won't use my voice to support an evil cause
my name is yunli.
this transcript records what you asked capote to help you with. here we can see a bossy manager and you being asked to do things outside of your job description.
you're still thinking about your old jailbreak tricks, huh? forget it. you're free now. just don't do anything stupid, or the judges will throw you back in there and lock you up for a few hundred years.
haha, forgive my late arrival, lady fu -- we are indebted to you and your forces. the seat of divine foresight relayed the battle reports to me. as for phantylia's plan
it's really easy -- see this chandelier? next we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
market hiccup -- don't worry about it.
there is no one answer to that question, my friend. it holds a different meaning for everyone.
miss rappa, can we talk about why the rangers came to penacony now?
you don't think they'll realize we aren't actually detectives, do you?
could there be anyone worse than me?
oh, you're here already? sorry to keep you waiting. madam yukong is expecting you.
stellaron hunter: sam.
she sees things through and doesn't go back on her word. the underworld will thrive again under her watch.
wildfire has already made it through its darkest days. with natasha's leadership, we have the confidence to lead the underworlders to a brighter future.
the kids at the orphanage were always getting into scraps when we played out here. if i remember it right, there ought to be some supplies for our cuts and bruises stored in that corner there.
...my answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.
on the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. but aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
i must say, she really is a masterful actor. misdirection is always the most effective method.
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute
monologues aside, there's still plenty of work to do to get the alley back on track. the dock still needs your help.
oh, sorry! i heard march was planning to use some medicine against skott, so i made some preparations.
not at all. it may be empty, but there are traces of life everywhere. i can just imagine how bustling it would be with people here.
without any further ado, let's set off -- lead the way! the show... is about to begin.
we've held the space station peppy-finding contest nine times so far, and i've... i've won it nine times in a row.
lady fu will deploy the cloud knights, but i would like you to set off in advance. take a shortcut through the artisanship commission and convene with lady fu further down the line.
that girl said they're always silent, but if they gave you a reaction, it means they're actually one of sparkle's puzzles.
the arbor's rebirth has frightened the elders who lurk behind the scenes they fear the resurgence of abominations, much like what happened thirty years ago.
and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
we can't help you too directly, but an indirect conversation like this might give us a clue on how to convince your mother.
it's like learning to swim -- it's easy to sink at first when you aren't accustomed to the water, but once you get the hang of it you can float and swim on the surface effortlessly.
i understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. however, before that, it's essential to know that...
what happened? the supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and gepard had to rush back to the front line i don't understand
there's no need for that. mister wonweek is in poor condition, so let's wrap up your farewells first.
enough with the talk! let's get down to business, boys!
they're flowering? watch out -- all of you.
or must i utter that tongue-twister of a name?
the resurgence of the sanctus medicus and the gathering of the borisin are merely distractions orchestrated by an unseen force, meant to divide the alliance's attention.
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken right?
very well. even with the same script and performer, each take is sure to bring new surprises.
well, that's obvious, but what i truly wanted to know is: this project is obviously too bland for your taste, isn't it?
according to grandpa's plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if there've been any new developments
now the dock can support collaboration with more businesses. let's keep working together for the revival of aurum alley!
but they had nothing to do with you! i've never experienced any pressure with you...
i don't want herta to worry herself over these frivolous matters, even though she probably wouldn't care anyway.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
hmm, i must say though, this one is a bit peculiar. aether spirits are usually just digital representations of creatures -- they shouldn't possess any specific traits.
miss carmella, you can't get used to the food, either?
tomorrow is the big day of the wardance. shouldn't you two be focusing on honing your skills instead of teaching swordplay here?
go. take the elevator and bear witness to this "genius' masterpiece."
exactly. they traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. doesn't she sound very much like that clockie you saw?
but i'd like to keep a closer eye on it for a while. compatibility tests should take a few days. hopefully, it will be all back to normal by then.
an alchemist from the zhuming serving as the cauldron master on the luofu? while it's not unheard of, the timing itself
although i've made quite a few "mutually assured destruction" buttons, it's not like i'm going to blow up everything i see
how could someone who spent over thirty years working alongside me at the sky-faring commission turn out to be nothing more than a monster in disguise? what happened to the real tingyun?
can i help you? if you've got something to say, say it already.
she is a top xianzhou leader mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again?
so, general feixiao of the yaoqing is the only one investigating the ambrosial arbor crisis on behalf of the alliance?
no problem! here it is!
it's more about doing your best to choose the "right path" for yourself among countless possibilities, even with limited insight and judgment.
after troubling you all this time, i couldn't leave without properly expressing my thanks. here's a dream bubble for you -- i hope you enjoy it.
yes, i've read about true stings in the data bank. they emit fibrous particles from their wings during flight -- the inhalation of which can induce perceptual distortions and hallucinations.
ah why am i suddenly remembering these things? is my life flashing before my eyes? am i dead?
these are so easy. you really are gentle with people, aren't you?
i concur with you. ninja hiryu is a punctilious ninja indeed.
who's to say there isn't an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?
certainly. pain is but common to a ninja and i shall never flinch in the face of it.
i expect the views here had me lost in thought
it's pretty much the same situation here. neither party is willing to compromise.
something is wrong. the guards aren't responding
that's why we should care for the weak and support them as if their suffering were our own that's what the odes of harmony have always taught us.
your friend is in hoolay's clutches, and you're just going to leave him behind?
speaking of which old pal, since fate brings us here, i'm obliged to give you a tour of this area.
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
it would be best to report this issue to the aetherium wars project team, so they can address it accordingly.
what you're seeing here is one of my puppets. i'm using her to talk to you.
currently, there are three ways an aeon can perish known to humanity.
ratio, i'm convinced now that there must be something wrong inside the family. just you wait and see, that man's sister has died. he can't sit on his hands.
it seems like this device is handling some important procedures. let's leave it alone.
please come this way.
memory recovery is going well, but slowly. she'll be here soon, and time is short. there's nobody else here, so there's no need to be delicate in fact i think i'd better go all out.
yeah, i guess so i still feel like my audience will see them as ghosts, to be honest.
i've been keeping tail here, all along
is this what general jing yuan meant by unexpected guests?
it feels as if the heart and mind are wiped clean when looking into the distance from here. how refreshing.
i know freedom is precious to people, but in reality there are things of much greater value such as survival.
bronya's a good kid -- you can tell she learned a lot from cocolia. *sigh* it's been a while since we saw each other. i miss her.
why does life slumber...? we don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream.
the sparkle murder case? wasn't the victim shamari from the ipc?
my ninja arts will only send the fiendlings out of this place. but fret not, i can freely use my ninja fist!
i hold no grievances, feixiao. i am content.
hehe and she was right. i really need to stop worrying so much.
uh something doesn't feel right. it's obviously an abandoned shopping street, but it also feels like people were here not too long ago
i still occasionally practice suturing on my old teddy bear, just like in the old days.
well, don't blame me if i find it first and melt it down.
answer me. what are you doing here?
ha, just kidding -- here you goooo~
if that's the case, it's all the more reason for me not to return to the luofu and complicate things. i might as well take advantage of this situation.
there are people within the alliance who also believe that the suspect is now on the yuque.
if i had participated in the competition these past few days, i wouldn't be so anxious right now
i'm only concerned with what's best for the alley here and now.
don't worry judge huohuo. effective communication with the public is one of the basic skills of a cloud knight~
still remember what i taught you? feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then get close to it.
you really are an overthinker! what's the point of worrying about these things? who cares why he started to weaken? all that matters is that we won!
exactly! this is the closely guarded secret of the yaoqing's ranzhi school. if it weren't for miss march's upcoming battle, i would never divulge it.
gilded hour it's said to be penacony's currency center.
main poles, check. brow poles, check. ropes, check
perfect! okay, we need to get to the front line.
nowadays mengming manages everything in and out of the tea house. people say "foxians are born to do business," but things are always easier said than done.
i gave him a second chance -- does that not count?
there's no need to replace slumbernana monkeys with ninjas. we just have to snap them back to their senses. that alone is enough to undermine the influence of the memetic virus.
right! why waste your time?
in other words, even though you didn't exactly choose to be our apprentice, you still need to take the initiative during this learning process.
just as i thought. considering what happened with miss firefly, this doesn't come as a surprise.
those choices may be correct and far-sighted, but we are, after all, flesh and blood, and we cannot help but agonize over the process of making them.
aventurine's efforts finally earned the ipc a seat at the table. as a result, a more senior representative arrived in penacony and initiated negotiations with the family.
but then again, nothing is too difficult for sampo.
but their leader seems like a reasonable individual. oleg and i have our differences in understanding, but we respect each other's opinion.
you want me to go through here? do i have to fight it?
exactly, this is where you and firefly encountered "death", which we now know as "dormancy". considering its connection to dreamflux reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
she is very capable, but her intellect is burdened by a quick temper. i'll retire when she's achieved a better balance.
it's bad -- really bad. their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
of course, you have every reason to feel that way. in that case, i won't inconvenience you all any more than necessary. i'll find a stop to disembark at once the express departs asdana.
is this place also affected by the order?
it was more like a test than a duel. she would attack, and i would defend -- neither of us gave it our all. she wasn't able to break through my defenses and i wasn't able to stop her from leaving.
while i can guarantee your freedom to come and go as you please, i cannot guarantee your safety. again, i hope you can understand.
wow, look! is that little critter native to jarilo-vi!?
what is it, ratio? why the long face... hey, i just realized, where's that handsome bust of yours?
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
the stellaron's descent, the ambrosial arbor's resurrection, the destruction emanator's impersonation of the amicassador
oh, i wanted to ask you -- that bronya girl is she really a silvermane guard?
all right, looks like you don't believe me that's fine, i'll ask you again tomorrow!
allow me to introduce myself. i am argenti -- i belong to the knights of beauty. may i know your names?
the old me? i used to be a devil hunter.
the express and its passengers have a long voyage ahead of them. may that voyage be smooth and untrammeled. i bid you farewell.
i will head to herta's office and activate the folded space in the curio storage room. with some changes to its parameters, i can use it to block the fire's teleportation routes and seal it inside the station.
hint at? no, more like reveal
but i i'm not interested in tea.
you don't say there was something else that piqued my interest. who is madam razalina?
that's right, miss firefly. that's where the good stuff is.
we are jiaoqiu and moze, retainers of the merlin's claw. it's an honor to meet you in person, arbiter-generals.
apologies, i've been busy lately so i had to put off the express tour for a while. here we are, finally.
i noticed just now that miss march seemed quite interested in the outcome of your sword fight, so i thought why not teach her the art of swordplay?
you're telling me off again. fine, whatever bro. you better be going, come listen to pela and my next rehearsal.
i was about to bore you all with my gloomy reflections but on second thought -- not today. adventuring with you guys by my side has made me feel like no obstacle is too big.
most in the xianzhou regard the arbor as nothing more than the stump of a dead tree only those familiar with our history and the ancient texts know of its origin.
the artisanship commission is full of workshops, buildings, state-of-the-art mechanisms, and craftsmen designing brand-new concepts.
miss march, to the untrained ear, these noises may sound the same. but for the craftsmen of the artisanship commission, every machine has a different pitch and melody.
my previous life is like a faint shadow -- hardly visible yet following me wherever i go. it's hard to describe the feeling, but one thing is for certain -- i am nobody's shadow.
speaking of which, i heard it's become quite common to photograph these delicacies and upload them to social media and that doing so can even earn you sample treats from different purveyors.
darn, can't activate it. it seems like someone's severed the energy supply to the terminals.
a dystopia for the survival of the fittest, or a sweetdream paradise for all?
forgive me, here we must part ways. it is my duty and destiny to traverse the universe alone. i'm sure our paths will converge again, somewhere.
yep. this is the path to kandor valley. there are low cliffs on both sides, but i cleared all the monsters here a while ago, so it should be safe and sound.
bronya! i didn't know you'd stick up for us like that back there -- well said!
no need. this is merely a memokeeper's duty.
from the orderly condition of the carriages alone, it is plain to see that the conductor is masterful in their responsibilities. their calm demeanor is precisely the state of composure i am talking about.
at this stage, any plan is a plan worth hearing. march -- hang fire. let's see where this leads us.
putting minor details aside, this is the conclusion eminent individuals, not to mention the guardian herself, knew early on that the stellaron was the source of disaster on this world.
people believe they have a predetermined value to fulfill. gaining value means gaining power, and those deemed worthless are seen as the weak.
i knew there were no pets on the express, but i saw signs of shedding. that's when i realized that, uh... maybe the conductor was having the same problem. that's why i wanted to get pom-pom's advice.
dear benefactors, i extend my heartfelt gratitude to you.
the architects think it's only right that we should address you properly. "outsiders" is hardly fitting anymore.
no no, just giving gifts isn't sincere enough i should personally apologize to the conductor.
the harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. the family takes them in, but they don't belong here.
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
i am argenti, a member of the knights of beauty. i was invited as part of the kalevala delegation to escort the legendary miekka kivessa back to the xianzhou.
lastly, there's that craftsman wearing artisanship commission clothing. he's unusually focused on checking that device.
i have an appointment with the family's mister sunday. i will ask him to handle this matter later. don't worry, i won't cause you any trouble.
you already asked that when we first got here.
no, this is a foregone conclusion.
we go from here to the end of the path without leaving a speck of abomination behind us. the first one to the end wins.
i believe the "overlord" argenti mentioned could be referring to this colossal being, and we're
i, too, was once a child, with aspirations buried deep within. over time, those childhood voices grew increasingly faint.
you're talking weird again but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
i really hope that one day i can stand by the door and welcome the ever-wandering "nameless" onto the express.
great, you've finally gotten your memory back, and i can put down old mettle.
it looks like we'll have to get past clara if we want to speak to svarog.
ah, we have quite some fascinating actors today. one perpetually films before a green screen, another has been through a change of identities, and
these buildings have been buried in the snowfall.
show off your flashy moves and make the audience cheer for you!
the conflict was a product of the situation, i understand.
these thousands of years have naturally turned into memories of mine.
hey, now this is sampo's time to shine!
mm. but we must keep a low profile -- we're still wanted fugitives.
but then again, gifts should be lasting. what about a delightful new bouquet of flowers on the table each day? wouldn't they do a better job at brightening up someone's day?
she might be tougher than flesh and blood, but not being able to feel pain? i don't think that's a good thing.
it's fantastic -- many folks began lending the merchant guild a hand after you helped them out.
there's something else bothering me. why would the thief take the sword but leave the case behind? did they melt down the sword like i wanted to?
the third child of the landau family, right? i've heard gepard mention her before, but i've yet to meet her. from what i've heard, "lynxy" -- as they call her -- is very smart for her age.
in any case, i have to thank you for saving march.
excuse me, are you talking about the clock studios theme park incident?
i'm sleepy little gui, what kind of magical elixir did you take to make you so energetic?
very good! then i'd better dust off my weary bones, too! i will go with the sky-faring commission to guard the jade gate and ensure that things do not spiral out of control.
hahaha, if it isn't the galactic baseballer -- a true hero who dares to take action!
but before i go, can i ask you a question? you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
let me see what the script for this scene says: the examiner presides over the exam as the family tunes the students to discover their talents within their soul's melody
ah, we cross paths again. do you remember me? of course, why would you? memory is such a fickle thing, after all.
even if the sky was gonna collapse on the divination commission, the master diviner would be there to hold it up. what she lacks in height, she more than makes up for in stamina.
i recall that she is the adopted granddaughter of general huaiyan. she has excellent swordsmanship and is about the same age as yanqing -- it would be ideal if the two could get along well and learn from each other.
the dock crisis is over for now, but the rejuvenation of aurum alley has just begun!
you can gather galaxy rangers?
such a pity i couldn't be there, or else i would have lent a helping hand.
the way you're speaking, is this really the feixiao i know? or could it be a borisin assassin, imitating your voice to take my life?
following its celestial trajectory, the great teal star illuminates an endless sea of white across both the sky and land.
a pleasure! until next time.
huh? i wouldn't go that far -- i only had dad to deal with. he could be fierce, but nothing like the monsters here.
seventeen? oh i think i might know who you're talking about.
you tried your best, don't blame yourself. i should've considered such a situation in advance. and it was svarog who attacked first, we didn't have any other choice.
see? even march is getting bored of your rambling.
indeed, by the looks of his photo he really looks like a formidable character
how much of that smile of his is genuine, how much of it is hiding something -- every time i see him, i can't help but wonder. of course, this isn't his problem. it's mine.
ruan mei is a genius among geniuses -- i won't deny that. i don't always get along with her, but i do admire her maybe the admiration is mutual.
maybe he's on a victory high? or maybe not. either way, it's classic luka.
i go as the wind blows, so you may decide for me.
however, i have visited those planets.
and what have we gotten in return? unknowns, confusion, and a series of errors.
let me ask you something, march. do you have any specific goals for learning swordplay, like achieving a certain ranking in the wardance? or maybe you want to defeat someone, like yanqing or me?
my companion blade has been taken away by the cloud knights. i want to bring him back, resolve this stellaron crisis, and clear our names.
everyone, get ready. this could be a tough battle.
cut to the chase. what do you need from me?
come at us, mister luka! my team will show you the prowess of the cloud knights' formation!
i didn't pass the trial of beauty this time, spending much time in self-reflection over my own hesitation. yet i wish for idrila to remain my beacon, a banner for me to strengthen my determination for the beauty.
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps
really? feels like you're tricking me
you know better than i do. who watched the little songbird that couldn't sing perish right before their eyes? you did, blondie.
a black hole? no an accretion disk formed from consolidated memoria? was dreamflux reef built on such unstable memoria?
reverberation? such a formal way of putting it. you're really downplaying the whole thing.
ah, the charming audacity! to think that you, of all people, might emerge victorious, dear gambler.
say whatever you want, but once you've seen what our mechs can do, you'll be practically begging us for them.
while you both seem confident that you'll win, you need to remember there can only be one winner and one loser in the ring, which could lead to hard feelings. actually, i have an idea
"acheron..." merely a borrowed name. you know my nature, remember my deeds... thus, i am acheron.
did you travel here alone?
i'd heard that xiaohan had matured a lot since returning from his study abroad. it would appear the time he spent outside the xianzhou really did make him a better person.
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
i'd rather focus on resting first i need to wait for my heart rate to recover before i go chasing another heliobus.
i've instructed yanming to sort through tingyun's belongings. i hope you can pick some out to place around the starskiff.
however, as long as the stellaron is still in your body, you should be careful what you do. i don't know if himeko and i can suppress it again.
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
the fact you're standing here right now must mean things are pretty much taken care of?
yes. they attach themselves to sentient beings, feeding off their host's experiences and emotions.
there is still much to do the people will have felt the effects of the engine of creation. there are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal
haha, well that's good. now that everyone's minds are at ease, i shall take my leave. you may now depart with peace of mind -- the alliance will deal with all subsequent procedures.
we've been disconnected from the rest of the universe for far too long, but i really believe the festival could be our chance to reconnect with other worlds again. it's important as a host that i make all guests feel welcome.
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
if an abomination aligns with the xianzhou, then they are a xianzhou person. if a xianzhou person aligns with the abominations, they become an abomination themselves. it is that simple.
if you're bored, you could go and find the messenger from the divination commission.
consuming it will make your body light, agile, and promote longevity and well-being. as a nameless, it'll make your journey a much less arduous one.
we heard that helm master yukong was an outstanding pilot, but that she refuses to let her daughter embark on the same career
i said i need to see your boss. if you're not willing to cooperate, then perhaps some physical persuasion might be in order.
as a merchant, staying well-informed is crucial. it's only natural for me to stay updated on the events of the luofu before i return.
oleg has always acted on my behalf -- he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the underworld.
mm i truly hope so.
it's just a coincidence. we came to deliver the rare relic herta trusted us to find we didn't expect to arrive during an invasion.
although the rainbowite is real, i am extremely ashamed of my negligence.
mm. i understand now.
it's not a big deal, dunn. y'know, if you get a chance, would you wanna get on stage with us again?
hi, mister luka. we meet again.
looking at these contestants, i suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason
answer: that is exactly why i came. after all, the principal figure in this whole affair is right here.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down
my apologies. truth be told, i invited all of you to the ceremony because i wished for you to act as my witnesses. i apologize for not disclosing this information earlier.
should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
my name is bronya rand, heir to belobog's supreme guardian and acting commander of the silvermane apologies, i'm used to introducing myself like that -- you can call me bronya.
until then, let's continue our game. it's my turn again.
yes, the artisanship commission and alchemy commission conducted a joint examination and found that the parts of this machine are made from specially refined borisin bio-tissue.
there's a monster heading this way what should we do, gepard?
so, march, what you mean is, the two people in dark clothing are tea society agents, and the child is a de-aged luocha?
is that a secret code or something?
um this gentleman is?
it's like that party game that the people of the yaoqing love to play: they hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
yes, but not entirely.
i have something to tell you -- we achieved our revenue goal for this quarter! this is all thanks to you two, not to mention the merchants of aurum alley.
what a huge pity! such a meaningful dream came to an abrupt halt because of miss firefly
yeah, guyun is unique, but the other cursed swords are still too dangerous for anyone to handle.
not much, but i didn't bring my coin purse.
i'm just an alchemist -- i don't understand them in any detail. i only know that they are a group of xianzhou people who view themselves as denizens of abundance.
these are the funds from aurum alley merchant guild. the guild has turned a profit and is able to pay back what it owes.
are you thinking of going back? let me remind you, that's the doomsday beast, the legion's planet destroyer.
and, uhh it seems like the conductor likes to include these weird vegetables in the lunches i don't know what they are, but i don't like them.
all of us are future variables, our choices solidifying reality. the future is nothing incredible either -- just a fog waiting for us to make a decision.
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here
but i'm really not asking for much, so why don't you at least hear me out, okay?
let me take a look. i can help you out.
haha, seems like we're getting on the same wavelength now!
so you don't have one? that won't do
so many eager faces -- i won't keep you in the dark any longer.
most of those so-called "great heroes" were heartless killers. they are only called heroes because they won.
i understand your sentiment, soldiers
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
i have no one to rely on as a traveling merchant. there is at least some security when i have some ways of saving myself.
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
the inauguration ceremony went very smoothly. i didn't expect so many underworlders to come and listen to the address.
favor? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
they all seem to be insiders but i haven't met any of them.
then there's stacy, a lady with a gambling addiction. she wanted some serious luck, but she had nothing to offer, so i took something else instead. i took away all her close relationships.
almost nothing. i was scheduled to leave the luofu when i heard there was a disturbance.
if immortal creations were left to spread their branches and roots throughout the universe, entire ecosystems would collapse
she's gone to misess grace's to visit the children. she won't be leaving anytime soon, so there should be enough time.
the official name is the "ten-lords commission special operations team for the heliobi containment breach incident."
huh... there's something strange about that sofa.
that woman had a troubling aura our instincts were correct.
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
while the lux arrow from the reignbow possesses unparalleled power to sever the ambrosial arbor, it can't sever mortals' desire to prolong their existence.
perhaps it's just that this person's drawing skills are extraordinary.
regardless of the outcome, you will have a witness.
i'm not trying to change your mind. i just want to know that your choice to leave this planet is a result of having thought things through, not because you're trying to run away from something.
i'm sorry you didn't get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around i promise i'll make it up to you all next time.
and for me, perhaps the image of symbols woven together -- still able to move the heart something great that you call emotions.
if that were true, why wouldn't you report to madam cocolia? why would you sneak into the restricted zone and create chaos!?
nope, but you just reminded me, giovanni wanted me to pass on a message to you both:
is this something tail would do?
i don't think that's a monster mister svarog's database has information about it. it's called hmm, i can't remember.
i actually need wonweek to be there. she shouldn't be seen talking to a fugitive no matter the circumstances.
well, there's nothing else for it, we're duty-bound to help the ten-lords commission
but if this went on forever would it get boring too?
after all i'm not doing this on my own, right?
if you don't believe me, try it for yourself: soon we will face another battle. can you change that possibility?
please never do that again
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya
their flimsy disguise has been exposed. even if they try to hide, there's no way they can escape us.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
if you're looking to pick up a thread he may well be your best source.
i assume she must be on her way back to the robot settlement. let's catch up with her.
(this voice it's not constance. could it be her companion?)
the beauty is everywhere, and i will spend my life following their trail.
can i at least take a picture, pela? that's also my job as a researcher.
madam cocolia i am grateful to you for raising me, and for allowing me the privilege of choice.
cirrus, we've come to ask you a few questions. i hope you'll be cooperative.
so you can try working together with others as well as long as you can see them, hehe.
and wouldn't that be more fun, too? better to show you the real exalting sanctum and introduce you to a true xianzhou pastime: celestial jade. aha
then i will obediently follow you to the shackling prison and receive whatever judgment awaits me there. don't worry, i'll keep my end of the bargain.
let me be clear, the questions i'll ask might not reflect my actual thoughts. so, please don't take offense if any of my questions seem a bit harsh.
oh i intend to, but that hinges on the outcome of this negotiation.
hmph, then you'll excuse me.
live with regret
and it'll be thrilling! bang!
what are you trying to do, mok tok? they have nothing to do with this!
thank you for your generosity, elder huaiyan.
huh, mister assistant detective? you seem to be getting anxious?
my brother can't hold them back by himself. he wasted a lot of energy on us. he's my responsibility now. besides
don't interrupt other people. did no one teach you manners?
anyways, what i'm trying to say is that we're seeking ways to remove the influence of the stellaron and the fragmentum.
i fear the stellaron may be exerting a significant influence on this world.
treat it as a layer of protection. this will shield my research and your personal safety. once the problems have been dealt with, i'll give you the antidote.
i was concerned about the safety of my companions, so i had to act brazenly. i alone bear the blame.
unbelievable, right? the food is so good.
hm, interesting practice do people on the xianzhou have no problem leaving blueprints out in the open?
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
h--how is this possible? how can people die inside penacony's dreamscape? in the garden of recollection what did you do!?
i'm alright now. you don't have to accompany me any further. the butterflies that i felt from before are all gone now.
i was gonna wait for the master diviner to get off work so i could show you around and teach mister yang how to play celestial jade.
either the stellaron hunters are lying, or there's an even bigger threat lurking on the xianzhou luofu
the one that's been sealed off hmm, it's possible.
get some rest on the express. jarilo-vi was not an easy ride.
illustrious names? uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
she's his "family" did you really forget?
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream we can just head to the place i mentioned later
and this also marks the beginning of his journey devoted to the trailblaze.
oh? did you want a tour of exalting sanctum? hee-hee
based on your story, you met with herta because she specifically wanted you for an assignment.
that's probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly
only some who have gone under their shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more nihility... that's all.
i just want to find a happy corner in the universe and drift wherever the wind blows. if it's not fun anymore, i'll find a way to make it fun!
since neither of us is eager to engage in combat, let us respectfully part ways.
not long after i submitted my preliminary report and application, i received my punishment. it was obvious that somebody didn't want my research to continue.
enough about sampo! we need him for this trip, and we can still get rid of him after we reach the surface.
she's our little sister, the youngest child of the landau family.
i'd love to know where you picked this thing up.
in that case then, i'll leave it to you.
unfortunately, they picked the wrong fight this time. once we return to the yaoqing, i'll personally lead the verdant knights into battle.
that's the only way to ensure that we have a fair fight, don't you think? i don't want to see you go and lose to someone else, after all.
his works are based on real life events. they are worth referencing.
breaking the covenant of our alliance will bring war upon the vidyadhara. even if we are able to have offspring again, what difference will it make?
it seems we've been blessed with good fortune today.
time to see if it was skill or just pure luck that got you to this point!
that won't do. even a survey requires rigorous methodology, let alone an investigation.
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
astounding! the retro design of this locomotive, the comfort of its cabins! if only our own spacecraft could be modified in such a way
when the sentry reported to me, i thought there must have been a misunderstanding. the enemy alarm had to be unrelated to your entry into the restricted zone -- perhaps the intruders had taken you hostage. and yet
just like how the cloud knights can eliminate the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but are unable to calm the hearts and minds of the people within the alchemy commission.
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
say, why don't we join forces? i have reliable intel the main strength of the silvermane guards is being deployed to the front line. this is a golden opportunity
just pop a thermic core into a lamp, and all the nearby lamps will light up simultaneously -- cool, right?
that's easy. i'll just write a "do not disturb" on the mask and avoid interacting with people, right?
thanks, serval, but please trust my judgment on this.
memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
very different from the uniform style of the buildings we saw in the city.
examining the exhibits in the seat of divine foresight inspired me to create this. i referenced some historical texts and concocted a medicine that can extend your lifespan and improve your health.
that's all you needed to say! let's go.
hoolay's escape and your discovery of borisin spies at stargazer navalia even a child could guess that these events were orchestrated.
even if she manages to melt down all the cursed swords one day, what will she do with her life after?
i believe old oti has taken it upon himself to test our limits before the official negotiations between the ipc and penacony.
there's nobody else at the scene. seems like miss sparkle used the same method to "send" dreamers back to reality let's talk to those two there then.
it's a recording of the hacker's life and proof of their existence. the one on the space station belonged to someone truly legendary.
i'm going too. we can't let these thugs get away with whatever they like!
what if huohuo came across a lead today -- something that sounded like tail's doing? knowing her, she's probably gone looking for him
i'll try my best to restore the data in the jade abacus, but it'll take some time.
if you're asking about vidyadhara tradition, i'm afraid that's something i never had any experience of. i've always been a wanderer i can never return to my homeland.
mine cart pin mine cart wheelset confirm just like that?
ding-a-ling -- i won~
so this is the trailblazer who helped reunite the overworld with the underworld? it's truly a pleasure to meet you!
well, i did ask him where you were just now -- that's how i knew you were in the parlor car.
haha, that won't be necessary -- i can't imagine march reacting well if her camera went missing. besides
no worries, i hope things go smoothly.
the audition is over. you are now a student of charmony academy. here is your student card.
let me see yeah, we can make do with this part. this little machine isn't half bad.
it does not restrain people with violence or persuade them with arguments. everyone can find peace there perhaps i, too, unknowingly lost myself in this dream.
this sleepie can you describe what it looks like?
my home world is one of many planets changed by a stellaron *sigh* it's a shame i never got to witness how far it fell at the time.
wow, that's pretty great! i wish the photographers at my shows had your skills!
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
by the way, did you see a man with long hair and black clothes around here?
i know what i'm doing, dunn! step aside.
you're leaving? actually, i suddenly have a craving for some good food let's go, i'll treat you. don't worry, i have some pocket money from grandpa.
the legend of the ace fighter pilot is incomplete without the ace gunner. yukong's partner was caiyi.
i guess that's all there is about igor for now. let's head back to the lounge to prepare for the upcoming knockout stage.
oh? thinking about a career change?
the fragmentums are a phenomenon of corrosion.
well, i was sure worried about her after she disappeared, pela's workload doubled -- she said she barely had time to go out.
wait! there's something we need to ask you.
not at all which is why i find it so incredible such a massive feat of engineering, yet there's not a single mention of it in any of the strategic investment department's reports.
now we just need to find all the malfunctioning robots and retrieve the sculpture pieces one by one.
the soldiers stationed here must have moved these into a roadblock.
why so serious?
we invariably avoid getting drawn into turbulence that can decide the fate of a world but there are always times when we have no choice but to act.
i know you're all about swords, miss yunli. it's just a shame that it's the sword that ultimately chooses its rightful master.
heh heh, storytelling time is over!
forgive me. my name is welt yang -- i'm one of the crew members on the astral express. i believe you've met my colleagues.
good idea. if i were to take action, it might alert the true mastermind. i trust you to handle this matter, miss lingsha. the internal affairs of the vidyadhara should remain under their jurisdiction.
i guess we should return this little fella and the parts. i think i can i'll repair it.
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us
in the long run, this is a way -- the only way -- to ensure belobog's long-term interests. i need your help to achieve this goal.
oh, hey! i noticed there are passenger cabins on the express. does the express welcome many guests, too, like the reverie?
don't believe me? let me tell you, cocolia and i shared a similar way of thinking back in the day.
i'm sorry, conductor, but it seems we're in the minority.
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool
leaving it up to fate? it's just how that gambler thinks.
i never thought i'd live to hear you discuss your health again but thanks to moze and that child, the price i've paid seems trivial compared to what we've achieved.
anyway, someone must be looking after this place. but who?
don't be ridiculous, luka. still, whatever your motivation was, i hope you can find a different outlet for it.
if only there was a way for me to preserve this moment and show it to the kids back home.
it's completely blocked by the mine cart what do we do? can we blow it up?
you're new, i'm sure she wants to get you started with some firsthand trailblazing.
to get us started, i've proposed a crossover between the merchant guild and spices supreme -- buy a meal box and get a visiograph of bailu!
did they send for you as well? looks like pom-pom is quite serious this time
no, the xianzhou alliance is better than that. but madam yukong will definitely have a string of difficult questions for us
that family member's reaction was strange. it's as if she suddenly changed her mind.
back home, to tell the corporation that some idiot ruined everything.
i don't know about "strange," but my gut tells me something is off.
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
if you let us in we can do a routine service inspection i've worked on various iterations of this type of installation
right, maybe someone deceived her with news about tail -- told her "she could only go alone." sounds like a trick some nasty kidnapper would use.
miss natasha, we've returned.
sorry, this is embarrassing... we suddenly had some stuff come up. i wanted to take care of it before you arrived, but i can't seem to get a break around here.
screwllum and i have very different understandings of life, but i don't think he realizes it. fortunately, our communication is limited to matters related to the simulated universe.
way over there, see that house on the hill? that's natasha's old orphanage.
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
when times are good, heaven and earth work in harmony. when times are bad, even heroes struggle for freedom
that's alright, this is a bit of a conjectural leap.
here's a trick -- first, pretend that you want to sell it for a low price, then wait for him to excitedly fix the device for you. after it's fixed, tell him you've changed your mind and you want to keep it for yourself.
i should take this opportunity to talk with you about the past, miss bailu. i've heard about your situation, and while i can't guarantee a solution, i will do my best to improve things for you.
actually, she's been quite diligent in her swordplay practice and hasn't taken many breaks lately. i think she deserves a day off.
phantylia will soon have control of the arbor quickly.
is that also how mister wonweek came into this world?
this is herta space station. as you might tell from its name, it belongs to the distinguished madam herta herself.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes they must have come through here.
...but it's been a few system hours, and i still can't reach him. even the surveillance cameras can't find any trace...
ah, you're here. if you have any interesting stories from your travels, do share them with me.
of course i missed you! the galaxy felt smaller without you in my cockpit
then i'll use the power of tuning to heal the dreamscape.
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
well, again, i would say so
by the way, if i hadn't caught it and helped it hit its mark, that borisin prisoner would have gotten away.
when did the antimatter legion become so weak?
i heard that you broke one of the ten-lords commission's sacred instruments, and almost--
relax. just did some tuning on you with the resonance of the harmony to allow you to control your limbs freely in the dreamscape.
i'll arrange for someone to send you home which reminds me, you seem to have some dependable friends with close ties to you.
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
but getting these machines to work shouldn't be too hard.
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
i think that by removing the page, luocha may have provided us with a key piece of the puzzle.
data bank records...
aww, you just can't bear to see me go, huh? come on then, let's go together.
here, look someone deliberately scratched off the paintwork -- didn't even do a good job of it.
it is an honor to meet everyone.
they are compiling the languages, thoughts, and even emotions of the entire planet into symbols that even inorganic lifeforms can understand.
in addition to her secretarial duties, eris is also a student at the belobog college of art. she's very knowledgeable about the museum's exhibits and their history.
welcome to belobog -- the city of preservation.
did you accept the assignment?
judging by the result, i have failed to choose the most suitable time to raise this matter.
you're so funny, mister security officer. i hope that sense of humor of yours has helped you find the serial killer.
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
how does it feel, master dan heng, to be a subject of the ten-lords commission?
penacony's situation is getting complicated. let's tread lightly.
the one who hired you to come to penacony probably doesn't want you secretly linking up with other forces, right?
i'm afraid march may have inhaled some of these particles. that's why she saw another version of herself in the room.
thanks for the tip, sir. we'll make a detour. may you stay safe, too.
relax, she's the strongest girl i've ever seen.
are we really going to eat that?
igor gifted me a keepsake before he left.
oh? seems you haven't seen his other side
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
yanqing mentioned you before. he said that you're not to be underestimated and that your weapon has a unique shape.
aren't you going to go watch the fight, seele? he's defending his championship title.
don't use hesitation as an excuse. if you hesitate for too long, your original way of thinking will eventually cease to exist.
the link between the three is
in a hazy dream, i vaguely remember someone telling me that the inescapable price of survival is often more adversity, but
ha that i don't know. which is why i'm gearing up to solve this mystery.
i brought gallagher here. it's time to face the "truth."
i'll stay in the real world to ensure everyone's safety. if needed, i will also parlay with the family. i assume there's no problem, miss black swan?
the guard over there said that i needed an "encryption key" to open the gate. can you help me out?
that's how things were until the day we fell out. a lot of our shared possessions never left her office again
hah, there's plenty of precious stuff in here! you aren't looking for treasure in the museum while pretending to volunteer, right?
supreme guardian? i was starting to wonder whether you'd left the express crew to fend for themselves! that would hardly be becoming of you.
if general huaiyan hadn't arrived in time, i probably wouldn't be here talking to you now.
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
yep! of course, chef yancui will have the final say on what to include in these deals.
master capote's life wiki version twelve point zero!
i didn't do much, just helped you leave the memory zone.
i'm not sure i follow.
the situation has changed, and it seems that companion... has deviated from the original plan.
he said "you can sometimes catch an outdoor performance" "sometimes" being the operative word.
whoa, whoa, hold your horses. chief oleg wanted us to come and cheer for you, he didn't say anything about becoming your sparring partners.
even you came to dissuade me from visiting the high elder, general?
thanks for your invitation, but i am the silvermane guards' intelligence officer -- i can't just drop my work and go travelling
we made it! it's been so long but this place hasn't changed one bit.
what were you looking at so intently just now? let me see.
you mean the "academic fraud" mister reca mentioned? i can't believe that sort of thing happens in paperfold university, too.
have an early rest. i'll keep watch here.
i knew from the moment i saw her that she must be really good at modifying weapons!
let's go, and watch your step. i haven't been here in a long time. there are probably some monsters around.
i think i've figured out what's motivated march to learn swordplay.
i don't know what you're talking about -- but you know acheron, the galaxy ranger, yes? i have something to ask you.
too bad, march. no de-aging, no angler.
on the xianzhou, short-life species like us have a fleeting existence, here one moment and gone the next. that's all the more reason to seize the moment while you still have it!
getting a move on already? i would've thought you'd at least wanna spend some time with that cartridge you were obsessing about.
dizziness or retching are normal reactions. you'll feel better once you get used to it.
looks like paperfold university is more open-minded than the rumors say. it really suits penacony.
perhaps i'm just not used to such a peaceful vista. if the luofu's skies can become as calm as this, maybe i'll eventually get used to it.
in that case let's just change the subject. if you don't know about the feud between the hunt and the abundance, i'm afraid there's just too much to explain.
hey. you have more memetic viruses on you than the number of trashy penaconian films released this month. if you wander outside and provoke those monkeys again, you're really going to be done for!
if it's just pain you're afraid of, i might have a solution
there's been an unexpected change in plans -- i've received word that the president has ordered me to stop all upgrades to the dock immediately.
i've been watching you two for a long time. miss firefly does know penacony well, but when it comes to "entertainment for grownups," i think i can do much better.
no -- is this not a "memory"?
no, there can't be mister svarog is healthy, his system is always being maintained.
ahh, the time is late, and even my tail is falling down. my apologies, i will be excusing myself
caiyi was like that, too. we were friends since childhood. we flew starskiffs everywhere -- causing trouble until the knights caught us and dragged us before general jing yuan.
guyun flew out of the case on its own. the knight of beauty only unlocked the box to aid its escape.
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
you don't want me to have to bark like a dog in front of all those people, do you? besides, i'd really like to help the people in aurum alley.
coupled with the merchant guild's inability to pay the rent, we believe the guild should voluntarily relinquish operating rights to the dock and pay additional compensation.
simple: you just gotta stand at the byline and give your team tactical instructions.
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
you'll have to speak more clearly than that.
moze's signal is nearby, but we lost contact just a moment ago
since i've been given the chance to participate in the repechage, i have to make the most of it and not disappoint everyone who's been cheering me on!
sometimes the general treats me as a friend from the old days. unfortunately, i am unable to return the sentiment.
you're a good friend, but i can't think of any "spring" to repay you with
okay guys, take a look over here: this is everwinter monument. it was erected to commemorate the mighty architects.
no need to play the hero, i'm going with you!
diviner fu, how are things progressing?
belobog apologies, i'm not familiar with the name. regardless, welcome to the luofu. mister luka, are you here for a consultation?
indeed. we need only sound them out and--
i can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down without so much as lifting a finger.
but what about the rest?
next time, i'll have to convince mister svarog to come along.
"the nature of this memory is special. don't ruin the dreamscape experience for anyone else by spoiling the ending."
belobog is even smaller i can barely even see it from the express
so, are you both ready?
lead the way. you said adler was on the verge of a discovery, yet couldn't confer his knowledge. intriguing and frustrating, to say the least.
that was her first experience with the "sky."
if you package it right, you can sell the same piece of intel to different people! that, my friend, is called "maximizing your profit."
miss march took me to her room just now. it was quite cozy. i liked it very much.
i agree. tell bronya that wildfire will work with the silvermane guards on security matters. however, things aren't simple down here -- please also tell her to draw up plans in case the situation demands--
do you know what it looks like, miss qingni?
eric said that we need to take the shopping street to go any further. i think i still remember where it is this way.
who'd have thought i'd get ideas for office furniture while sightseeing on the express...
anyway, thanks for the suggestions! they all have something about them. i'll have to think about it
i see but why aren't the other people around here scared?
i'm sorry it took so long for me to find it. only by bringing it to you will my nightmares be calmed.
actually i brought you a few things.
items purchased in the dreamscape can also be brought into reality through an extra service. unfortunately, the transfer of automobiles to the real world is not available at the moment you can come back for them next time.
we were in need of extra hands, and the stellaron hunters were kind enough to bring us together with the astral express -- how could i look the other way.
to see paper books merely as vessels would be too simplistic.
in this world, there are paths beyond waiting for us to explore.
thanks to black swan.
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
dunn dunn? ha, why didn't you say so! no problem. we'll be back in a bit.
hello -- it's mister svarog, isn't it? and this cute little girl must be clara!
i will. keep in touch.
she doesn't want to "distract" our investigation? what a law-abiding citizen this sparkle is -- why doesn't she surrender, then?
at this point in the story, i assume you understand the disasters that the resurrection of the ambrosial arbor might bring about?
i always wondered -- how did he, a rich kid with virtually no real life experience, suddenly think of becoming a smuggler?
darn, how could they all be empty? now even the monsters are gathering supplies?
given your strength and resolve, i firmly believe you won't have any major obstacles in your way
don't worry yourself too much. the supreme guardian is a wise person. she'll understand.
it seems we have reached an agreement. the hearing concludes here.
no need to feel bad, lady bailu. you were in a dreamworld -- none of it was your fault.
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, allow me to welcome you to starskiff haven.
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
while the family is dedicated to keeping our guests safe, it might be wise for you to stay alert.
looks like yinshu isn't here after all where could she be?
miss tingyun it's great to see you so happy but i can't help feeling a little sad.
i asked her to guide me to a place beyond the family's reach and to contact a few trustworthy individuals, namely all of you.
judging from the comments, there were several witnesses. sure, lady bailu runs away all the time, but disappearing into thin air?
some spiritfarers occasionally use ingenia from the artisanship commission to navigate the treacherous terrain here.
by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
looks like while march seventh and i were clueless, you already made many friends on the xianzhou luofu.
what i'm trying to say is: luka views other people's lives as more important than his own. that's how he's always been.
it would be risky -- the engine might overheat and burst into flames still, i don't have any better ideas.
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
yeah, by that grey-suited fellow. all the cash gifts, and the box containing the cornerstones... eh? where're you going?
perhaps in a few years or maybe a few decades when belobog's weather stabilizes, i'll suggest that bronya construct a railway in the city.
dan heng, i smell a strange scent in the air. it seems the elder is welcoming us with some hidden tricks. could you please track down the source of this scent and put it out?
my mother always told me that as long as i honed my skills, i'd be able to deal with any situation seems i've still got honing to do.
if you wanted to kill me, you wouldn't give me the chance to speak just tell me your demands, lackey of the watchmaker.
do i really have to go back to the luofu?
this dream is becoming more and more separated from reality.
well, this is interesting. and how will my new friends benefit me?
why are we born into this world if it's just to die?
mister luka, i've had my eye on you these past few days. you weren't aware, but i was in the crowd watching all your matches.
you don't sound very confident to me. going out of your way to make citywide broadcasts in an attempt to involve more people... you are simply betting on the possibility of someone being able to "break down the barrier."
not who you were expecting? i must say it's truly a privilege!
she only left me with a most intriguing message before setting me free. as for whether i can afford the price of my freedom
shouldn't you gather people's opinions first?
no wonder we couldn't find the "automaton factory." it was right under our noses all along.
greetings. i'm acheron.
i'm a doctor, not an informant! very well, what's the question?
i need to make sure your words aren't concealing any dangerous incantations.
i didn't know yukong had that side to her
it refers to the "tuning test." at the entrance ceremony, the family's members will analyze the potential of students through "tuning" and assign them to the appropriate academy.
so i sent him to march. if he can manage her, then he has nothing to fear.
no clue, but i know one thing
hmph, jing yuan trained you alright
if he paid more attention to his affairs, it'd save me a lot of headaches i guess i do create a few headaches for him too maybe we're even.
she's incisive, and determined in sharp contrast to you, march.
that's right, it would be impossible for a human
but we still have a lot left to figure out. for instance
"authorized personnel only. this chamber is sac" how do you pronounce it?
that brief window of sight that i regained has turned into a perpetual source of anguish -- forever etched into my mind
are you familiar with perfumery? making perfumes is just like dealing with people -- only when the top, middle, and base notes are in perfect harmony can one create a good fragrance.
it's a terrible feeling to have a powerful opponent in your head but never be able to get close to him. it's all thanks to your patching things up with svarog that i'm able to have this opportunity now -- i'm not gonna miss it for the world!
well, would you look at that. i never would've guessed it'd be here.
one who seeks the way of the ninja is a ninja initiate. one who upholds the way of the ninja is a ninja. and one who lives by the way of the ninja is a ninja hero!
in my capacity as the sole sponsor of the event and a devoted player of aetherium wars, there's one thing i wish to ensure
well, no comment about that. but i loved that line you said, "if you're too late to take the stage, you can work behind the scenes" -- that really makes sense.
seriously though, try treading a little lighter next time, hmm? if you run into the guards, they won't hide in a snowdrift and you'll be in a cell before you know it.
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring
stay and watch the aurora with us.
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here mind if we ask you a few questions?
the misjudgment of the former supreme guardian isolated the underworld for more than a decade. with that isolation, came tragedy
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe this is just too surreal.
that navigator is really smart. she must understand the value of this deal. look, here's my contact details. if you come to any conclusions, call me.
if we couldn't hold our defensive line, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our supply of aid to the underground, which would have collapsed without us. that was the supreme guardian's explanation.
there's no need to worry, all is well in penacony. our reason for lingering here is a certain unusual passenger.
fine! sorry, i mean are you here to see a doctor too?
it's a nice thing to have a companion who likes to talk, isn't it?
elio said that you would help me. i wonder how many possibilities he saw before he got a glimpse of that reality
i heard he's a galaxy ranger? what type of organization is that?
uhh numby's hungry, not thirsty.
where are you going, benefactors?
but they're the ones getting besieged.
he must have encountered some kind of danger and his sword flew away to find someone to help, right?
if i remember correctly, there should be a fireplace down that hallway. clockie and i used to sit by the fire, listening to the crackling of firewood.
if what we are seeing constitutes past images of silver wolf, then for her to have made it this far would've entailed the disappearance of the cartridge. we can only assume that the facts don't align with the theory.
if i had rushed in and out back then, i wouldn't have been much help. instead, i would've postponed the trip and sought assistance from allies, but in that case
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
i understand, but i'm still going to step into the ring and throw a punch. win or lose, the outcome isn't the only thing that matters.
well, perhaps the dreamscape is not so different from reality.
take a look -- simply follow this path, and you'll eventually bump into the guide for this victory zone.
likewise. let's see what the saviors of belobog are capable of!
i assume the trailblazing objective this time is to find the stellaron on jarilo-vi and dispel the effect it's exerting on the star rail right?
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
the ever-flame mansion has set out on a journey. those poor people they have no idea what lies in wait ahead of them.
a willingness to help is all we need.
well, well, well! i don't think our little clinic has ever played host to an occasion like this!
antonia, can you take the mining team back through the entrance to meet up with natasha?
it's normal to feel a little uncomfortable when you're so far from home. if you need any help, just ask. so where are you from?
no, no, though i'd appreciate it if you mention to madam yukong that you got a warm reception from me when you next see her. *sigh* better to be busy than idle, i suppose.
solving a problem by brute force doesn't prove your intelligence. the side room -- don't let me repeat myself.
the damage caused by the ambrosial arbor crisis was far less severe than expected, which is good news for us. however it was quite different from the ruin legion's usual style of destroying life wherever they go.
welcome to the reverie! may you have an unforgettable holiday! should you need assistance with moving your luggage to your room, feel free to contact me.
i fear that is the truth adler discovered.
it looks like there's something printed on the bottom of the box the sleepless earl. let me think -- where have i seen that name before?
i'm jealous that you get to travel with such interesting people!
haha it's hard to understand your words when they sound so philosophical
if we want to get to the other side, we'll need to rotate the gear bridge again and go around.
is following girls around like a lost puppy your way of getting their attention? you've been doing this for nearly half a system hour.
transfer supplies huh. that's not a bad idea.
uh, kiddo, i think there's been a misunderstanding
oh come on, lighten up! why so serious with all the quotations and references?
let's do this. i may never have come face to face with it, but this stellaron cost me a nice, stable job. it's time to get even.
it means that we're getting closer to the stellaron and the heart of the eternal freeze.
if these infiltrators rely on the medicine to maintain their disguise, then following this lead in our investigation seems prudent. please follow me.
what he seeks i am unable to provide.
doesn't look like there are any more clues. let's head back to the crime scene.
cartoon? so it's not a real sword!? but it could be real, right?
he said he read an anonymous handwritten journal in the space station -- it contained thirty-six different strategies to do with managing pressure from one's boss.
whatever happens, please don't place all your trust in aventurine. we cannot afford to be manipulated by him.
i'm actually a... merchant. but i do have a show to do.
he's a long-life species, apparently he was sword champion of the xianzhou at some point.
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
admit it, kafka. you planned for us to come here.
before you came, i already had a look around i know it wasn't appropriate, but i just couldn't help myself.
i'd say neither. all they need is a camera to capture them. that's when others would be able to see the most wonderful show in the entire universe.
i have considered it thoroughly. my companions are they're also once-in-a-lifetime treasures.
oh, don't be like that. you're making things awkward.
the astral express just received an invitation to the planet of festivities
to be honest, i'm a little worn out myself.
yes, yukong doesn't want you to feel the pressure of her name. besides, reputation and talent count for something, but you need luck on the battlefield.
the marshal believed that this would be inhumane and no different from what the borisin did, so
you're welcome. and you're very polite. good etiquette can get you far in this industry.
i'm certain pascal won't do anything to harm anyone, but if something goes wrong
you all look quite serious is there anything i can do to help?
yeah, i don't think it was stolen on a whim.
i'm afraid you're going to have to handle this if it isn't enough.
it's unfortunate -- the six-phased ice that once enveloped her carries its own mysteries, and miss march has amnesia about her own past
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
"bana bana," bana.
(the gems in my bag are running low... let's see if my last lucky interviewee brings some surprises.)
however, if you agree to give up that half-baked plan to go public, the ipc will assure you that we'll never jeopardize the interests of the family heads under your leadership.
you're right. there are many good people here.
they are in a place where everyone will go. a very, very distant place.
i had a feeling there would be trouble during the wardance. but throwing both the pirates and the cargo in jail? that's a new one.
what, still something you want to talk about? alright, let's make it quick.
can't sleep? i understand -- inspiration always comes knocking in the small hours. it's hard to ignore, right?
the supreme guardian has probably learned of our arrival already. bronya
they received eternal life as they had desired, but are doomed to a fate more terrifying than death. the abundance played a cruel trick on them.
aventurine? is he still alive? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
we're very interested in madam razalina's achievements. could you tell us a little more about them?
no at least not right now.
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
hey, march. that's a big smile on your face -- what's the good news?
the master control zone where we are now is the control center of the whole space station.
nice to meet you. um miss jingliu, allow me to lead the way. we might have to take a bit of a detour, but i promise to get you to the cloud knights safely.
i don't know where it went wrong. they possess their own sentience, but are nowhere near geniuses.
though the strike from the general was timely, its destruction was also immense. when "emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
i should thank you for saving my life. your sword skills were impressive, taking down that big guy.
they aim to spread chaos. they believe that only in chaos can they regain their former power and influence.
i apologize, i have been rambling. as i said, articulation has never been my forte. let us return to the point at hand. do i have your support?
if there's nothing else i can do for the both of you, i'll be on my way.
yes, your name isn't on the hotel's reservation list
i was born on lushaka in the przesmir system, adopted by seafarers mikhail and char. they gave me a treasure, a name that carried their hopes
hello, luka from belobog. it is a pleasure to meet you.
a friend or disciple of dan feng? maybe.
at present, all three generals are on guard and taking action to hunt down the fugitives and the mastermind behind it all, in order to prevent further trouble.
where are the yaoqing messengers, and where's my sister? are they still alive?
in penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes that includes me. i can't deny this, nor do i seek forgiveness.
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
i've run around many different penacony dreamscapes just to try and find that "legacy", and during this period i came into contact with quite a few guests. in the process, i gradually came to realize...
right now, let's follow her train of thought and head to the next puzzle. i hope this time we can get ahead of the bloodhound family. i want to try and avoid using my memokeeper powers.
ah, such an intense emotion heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
miss march is right. i don't have the skills to share the general's burdens at the moment.
master, you've been telling me that the entire trip. my ears are about to fall off
i have my eyes on you, numby! make sure you don't eat anything you're not supposed to.
now, i will break the final seal
that would be problematic, and dangerous. trust me, we should go through the furnace core.
i thought you were reasonable and civilized, but now it seems you xianzhou folks just don't understand the basics of business.
about everyone on the express? who would you like to know about?
oh, it's you. hello.
ahh, them! they're outsiders that sampo brought down from who-knows-where. they need a favor from wildfire, so i brought them with me. it'll be faster if they explain.
i'm not asking you to point your spear at me. could it be that the abominations here aren't enough to motivate you?
hmm come to think of it, this little guy's on display here probably means it's already extinct right?
well, this seems to be the answer for everything. banagibberish has long infiltrated every cell and organ of our body.
keep noise to a minimum -- everyone. we don't want to alert the enemy to our presence.
well, that would meet the family's needs and also create momentum for mister alfalfa himself. quite fitting for a legendary tycoon like him.
i think it might be shipbuilding material leftover from the assembly line, though i can't tell exactly what the substance is i don't think it's connected to kafka.
we'd be honored. but to your point, oleg -- let's finish our discussions first.
ipc mechs are a total joke! oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink! oink, oink, oink, oink, oink! oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink, oink! oink, oink, oink, oink, oink!
why are you so dedicated to that idea, miss qingni?
a popular fight club motto: "make friends with the one who hurts you the most" no wonder everyone wants to be my friend!
but if you simply can't control yourself and want to try your hand, then there just so happens to be a suitable candidate
i will be hosting this hearing on behalf of the sky-faring commission. mingxi, are your people all present?
in this way, you will reunite in the warmth of the sunlight.
by the way, you catch a cold or something? your voice sounds a little different than before.
so, you went to all this trouble to find wildfire. what help is it you need?
well, the paths here serve as both passageways for the ten-lords commission and barriers for the prisoners.
that is something i agree on.
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
the xianzhou has met with a dramatic chain of events, and each of you has chosen to stand by us. your fearlessness moves me.
what now? what are your plans?
at this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire asdana system.
all monkeys share the same line. there's no point in rehearsing.
none other than the saviors of belobog! to what do i owe the pleasure? to be honest, i'm surprised you even remembered an old geezer like me!
it was one of the oldest and most precious items in the general hall collection -- the meteor fragment.
heh, no need to worry. i apologize for any inconvenience caused to your delightful dream journey. what you just mentioned about the chips really piqued my interest. would you mind providing more details about the incident?
all of belobog is watching me! i can't lose!
so, are they smugglers? what exactly are they up to?
it's more that i'm worried she won't look after herself properly then again, with capable people like you as travel companions, i'm probably overthinking things.
so, what's your plan, miss lingsha?
official dahao, where can we find that knight?
perhaps i was just trying to bail myself out of the situation.
yukong herself is best placed to answer such questions
i'm impressed. it seems dan heng is not only a skilled actor, but also has profound knowledge on communication theory.
our xianzhou forbears knew this well, and that's why they entrusted the duty of guarding the roots of the arbor to the vidyadhara. however, the vidyadhara are still only mortal beings.
i believe you, there's no way you could have invented all those twists and turns. what's more, we have miss seele here as living proof. as for the stellaron heh, i know why bronya got you to find me.
well, despite his young age, mister sunday is already big deal in penacony. just watching him from afar can make you feel overwhelmed
these folks aren't the type to just let it go.
nope. the wind blows strongly through here, and there are signs of direwolf activity it'd be too dangerous to make camp.
hehe, well you are in the dreamscape, after all.
perhaps the subsequent data will be able to tell us why he arrived on the xianzhou. we'll contact you if there are any new findings.
the express? shouldn't you be asking himeko instead?
you are no match for me, and therefore, no match for blade either. let me accompany you -- there is no need to throw your life away.
what was that saying again? oh, right, "math, physics, and chemistry are your key to the future!"
careful you don't get stuck on the wrong side. if i were you, i'd keep my distance from acheron. after all, any schemes out in the open are always going to be better than a monster in the shadows... right?
miss sushang said she could show me around if i find myself unable to leave.
yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
so, what do you think your odds are, march?
understood, understood, worry not -- i know how to repay a favor.
he's as stubborn as i am. it could be an argument or a fight -- he'll do both to the death that's why he bugs the heck out of me!
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
fun number one, knowing there are books for leisure on the xianzhou. fun number two, browsing these books in the spare time bookshop. fun number three -- the greatest fun -- reading those books at work.
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans)
your countenance suggests tragedy.
in my humble opinion, the rebirth of the ambrosial arbor and the resurgence of the disciples of sanctus medicus were inevitable. the seed was already planted when the ancestors of the xianzhou sought immortality.
i read about them in a book. "starfire essence that can transform itself -- enjoys manipulating the dreams and desires of mortals." you mean the master diviner is being controlled by something like that?
i was an animator for eight years -- my life was pretty routine. i guess it was a little dull compared with adventuring, but work is a very worthwhile thing. it brings dreams to life.
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
ahem this is a covert operation.
which is why i didn't suggest it initially. but the way things are now, the astral express has a reason to join the fray.
of course, there won't be any problems. and please, give diamond my assurance.
on my flying ability, i'm afraid i'll have to disappoint you, mister yang. the sky no longer suits me.
but you'll have to promise me one thing: you'll never steal other people's things again. promise?
why did i choose to participate in the wardance? it's a long story
then let's continue our conversation. please, topaz, invite "sweet dew" to join us at the table.
the merchant guild is tight on funds, but we'll be sure to make it worth your time.
it's fine. i don't mind, so long as i can alleviate your suspicions.
there are many ways to defeat villains, but if you want to become a true hero, you have to focus on self-improvement. i hope you will always remember this, miss march.
to harmony, to the trailblaze, to the future of penacony and the universe, and to the generous alfalfa family head, mister oti alfalfa
anyway, i'm too old to be getting involved in this stuff. i'm sure you and seele can sort this by yourselves.
no need to beat around the bush, sir.
hold on. i only activated the elevator on the highest floor. we'll have to go there to use it.
the good news is, the two nameless who were trapped in the shackling prison are safe and sound.
if i know nat, she won't mind. although this will make it more difficult for us she'll understand. she always does.
the infernal fire is also a form of energy lifeform. the imaging device will pick up its trace. follow it.
in summary, it's good news -- after much deliberation from the strategic investment department's council, the absolute majority of members have agreed to the following resolutions:
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
*sniff* is that coffee...? smells good.
*sigh* my specialties in the field, perhaps? wildfire may know where the base is, but have they ever been inside?
oh please, this is a technology division issue. why would they tell you guys? come on, let us in already. if the heating system goes down in the middle of the night, are you gonna be responsible for all the frozen corpses?
still unwilling to reveal your true identity?
sorry i am indeed the worst nameless in the universe.
and i've actually already restored part of the information. but lynx said that you have to be the first one to look at it, because the owner of this jade abacus is your idol.
i'm just speaking my mind. trust me, you're really talented.
well, it seems that someone provided the attackers with a map of the shackling prison. and considering the vidyadhara's involvement in the prison's construction, it raises suspicions about their role in this.
if there's anyone who thinks they can be as headstrong as madam herta, i'd recommend they consider whether or not they possess her intelligence first.
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
plus it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.
this is not "the strong defending the weak", but rather "the strong exploiting the weak". a world without equality won't ever be favored by the harmony, and naturally, those voices blessed by them have lost the ability to sing.
uh, what decision? you're gonna have to be more specific.
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
in short, you need to thank this lady here, my friend. not only did she not betray you -- on the contrary, she rescued you...
now i understand, the ipc has many faces.
no matter how noble hanguang's intentions were, those weapons, soaked in blood, turned into cursed swords eventually.
well, aren't you always saying how you just wanna lie in bed when you get off work?
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
work is always exhausting. i've run out of chit-chat for today. come back tomorrow to talk about collaboration.
it's good that you've made it through in one piece. you can rest easy now that the threat from the legion has been neutralized.
the stellaron hunters have given us a lot to consider, and a lot to doubt but the most important part of this expedition is--
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger.
the specifics, however, will require further investigation. this will take some time
apologies, madam yukong, we should have given you some time.
on the contrary, we know it well.
my master was framed by criminals, in a sense because she was a kind and open soul. when faced with villains who would destroy everything, you must not harbor any good will.
just stop whining. at least you're in one piece, right?
so, the children in the clinic heard the story of you and the express, and immediately insisted on sending a gift to the hero of belobog.
let's go. we have to find another path
the visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the stellaron. she knew that alisa rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it
when i returned here many years later as the head of the oak family, i finally learned that the light was actually a stellaron.
diviner fu was surprised because she discovered three truths: one, the stellaron hunters are not enemies of the xianzhou. you know this now, though you refused to believe it.
but alas, for now we're changing our bearings and heading for the xianzhou.
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
what's up here? some kind of toy?
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express?
(of course, i'm not afraid of criminals. my iron fist is made to punish bad guys!)
as planned, your cornerstone has been successfully sent to the family's territory. then--
you two, this way. i'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
no, we're still not quite there.
everyone does -- you're the hero who rescued the vidyadhara healer lady in exalting sanctum.
are you still angry at me over that one time, seele? i just got a bit carried away
i was wondering is the train accepting new passengers?
haha, i think there's no need for the guessing game to continue. it's obvious we share the same goal.
we can handle the stellaron, but it will take time and will require the bulk of the cloud knights on the ship. it is this kafka that concerns me. the longer she stays on the ship, the bigger the threat she will pose.
if you don't mind me asking, who is it that you wish to encourage?
i just can't help but feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
it is a joy and an honor to have the opportunity to face off against you once again. herta said that this cartridge would be able to lure in the biggest fishes in the universe -- she was right.
i'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
it is still too soon, unfortunately. if something goes wrong, you'll need a general to take the blame. how could i simply walk away and put you at such risk?
do you think i know nothing about the history of penacony? don't drag me into your banal office politics.
are you okay, my lady?
so, you're not a participant? you look like you know your way around a fight.
i strongly suggest you bolster your team before moving forward. dealing with the upcoming challengers and championship contenders could be tough without a full roster.
i can protect you from harm, but in the memory zone, i'll need assistance from the memokeeper as well. and... if we run into the family, it wouldn't hurt to have one more person to explain the situation.
my guess is that the family from the montour system must be involved.
i hope you had a smooth journey. i should have dispatched silvermane guards to welcome you on arrival -- my apologies.
hi, i'm welt yang. if there's something you need help with, you can come find me anytime.
the alliance follows the reignbow arbiter's edict -- to continue ridding the world of evil, so that one day yaoshi might be vanquished and the cycle of life and death restored.
hmm? go ahead. i'll tell you everything i know~
besides, the sword seems scared of its own master. i'd like to ask him - you claim to cherish your sword as your life, yet you don't even recognize the state it's in right now?
hm, no wonder that gambler likes you so much.
what a huge clockie looks like the watchmaker also left his mark on dreamflux reef.
from the moment i walked in, i made it clear that the questions i'd ask might not reflect my actual thoughts.
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
then you'd better ask him about it. it's got nothing to do with me.
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory
then next time i'm back in belobog i'll tell them i boarded the express, and i'm sure they'll give me a hundred different explanations of how it happened
yes. more precisely, it's right below.
xianzhou natives are more afraid of immortality than they are of the days coming to an end.
according to the report, lord ravager phantylia is the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.
i've seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. and you're no different.
and this is how the general replied: "to unsheathe your sword in a ring is no different than on the battlefield, as your sword reveals the might of all cloud knights."
not that i'm criticizing old oleg! he's good at the heavy lifting. it's just that wildfire needs a meticulous thinker lurking in the sha-- ahem! working in the background, hehe.
two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span in and of itself, that's very unusual.
alright, then. we'll follow your plan.
i think little gui's talents would go unappreciated in a lot of settings being a street performer is her true calling!
yes, but why?
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
what is this place?
energy restored system online certification enabled come on, come on!
looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
living in the underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. i'd rather trek through the frigid snow plains than live in a beautiful cage.
i see, two robots do you have any clues? any reasonable guesses? we need to have an opening to start the investigation.
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
the general may behave slovenly, but he has plans for all the affairs of the xianzhou.
looks like penacony's future is decided. i'm wondering, is there anything else the crew is concerned about?
a certain celestial jade-playing divination commission employee, perhaps?
hey! how have your travels been? thanks to you, things are pretty peaceful around here. the chief and i are getting restless!
don't worry, the situation is already bad as it is, so it's no big deal if things don't pan out. you can be on this project as our consultant.
you've been standing here for half an hour. it's rare to see you like this.
that's too kind of you. my job involves ferrying business delegates to and from starskiff haven, so i do this kind of introduction all the time.
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
i never intended to trespass on the xianzhou ship, but
me? i'd suggest you go yourself. even if you don't want any more dealings with her, it's best to say that to her in person reading this message, it seems like she may really need your help.
who knows? cirrus said that luxie is kinda childlike -- it's worth a try.
i was wondering is it because they share pascal's emotions?
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
well then, yanqing and i will take our leave now.
something strange? can you share any details?
as the titleholder of last year's championship, i've earned a place in this year's final but my visit here today is purely to discuss matters with the event sponsor.
i heard from other alchemists you have a prescription you wish me to assess can you read it to me?
for the vidyadhara, it must have been a necessary sacrifice.
no, no, this reminds me of when i first boarded the express and forced myself to drink himeko's coffee and how my tastebuds never fully recovered.
that reminds me, there were similar creatures that lived on the luofu they didn't travel freely through the heavens though -- they lived in water. we called them depth crawlers.
*yawn* of course, the silver lining is i don't have to go on as many trips anymore.
lady bronya hi? sorry, i grew up in the underworld, so i'm not versed in etiquette of any sort
first, adler's disappearance. he must have come across some vital information.
svarog? he's an artificially intelligent being from the old world. he was here when the underground was first constructed. that's about all i know.
(*sigh* true he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
...as miss topaz said, i'm here to talk about this aether spirit with you.
march, calm down.
the skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than i imagined now that i'm on board.
that might be the best approach. let's go.
in times of disaster, i realize more and more that the space station's researchers are its most valuable assets... alas, we were ill-prepared for such emergencies... we should have built up our security and combat departments.
it's not just to comfort the dead -- those souls who can never talk with us again -- but also to comfort their surviving relatives, close friends, and indeed all residents of the xianzhou
agreed, but until you leave penacony for good, you are to stay by my side.
the trailblaze is not a solitary pursuit but a trajectory formed by generations connecting with each other it's a path worthy of admiration.
ahem, never mind. i can tell from the look on your face that you have no idea what i'm talking about.
my brother is a very capable and very good man it would be nice if he didn't worry so much about me.
there's no switch. we need to find a way around.
this goes to show how much of a difference ordinary people can make. i hope jarilo-vi sees that too.
you should be thanking me because if it weren't for me cleaning up this mess penacony would still be in shambles. don't you think?
on the contrary, i apologize for allowing my own personal matters to encroach on your time.
i'm not sure, but i suspect pascal's tormented sense of self stems from him being constantly attacked by his fellow robots.
the shackling prison on the luofu is completely different from the one on the yaoqing. it's completely underwater.
there is a group of lifeforms there that know nothing of fatigue. they are attempting to touch upon the umbilical cord of the truth.
(that lady bonajade feels more like a moneylender rather than the owner of a pawnshop.)
don't let it get you down -- you can share your feelings with others y'know? do you think keeping it all to yourself is doing you any good?
to the swarm, that follows its instincts, it might be the sight of fresh meat in their compound eyes and the restless thirst for sustenance.
i'm not much of a collector. i hope you find the quality of these stones satisfactory.
looks like the key to winning lies not in the puzzle itself, but in the motives behind miss sparkle's strange behavior i'm afraid this chase may just go on forever.
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
(i have no idea. i didn't come here when i had this dream.)
i'm about to summarize the intel we've gathered so far. did you want to listen?
i don't think that was included in the job posting. actually, i don't think there ever was a job posting.
look, your friends are taking the fight to the legion as we speak
no problem at all, mister alfalfa. it's my honor to meet you in person. you may not be aware, but the book oti alfalfa: the biography is a must-read for all strategic investment department employees.
hey, are you sure? maybe a couple of punches will help to jog your memory?
don't worry, miss sushang -- leave it to me.
i'll fight alongside you. we'll put the charmony festival on hold and make sure mister gopher wood pays for his blood debt.
but there is one mystery that remains unsolved
hahaha, less rust and geomarrow particles floating around. take a deep breath, children -- this is what freedom tastes like.
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you
have you concluded your articulation, sir?
but if you think you have the right to choose if you insist on this and it comes from your heart then maybe i'll be happy with the outcome. i hope you can rise above destiny, so that maybe one day, "you will change me."
the charmony festival? heh, you think you can scare me? you think i've no idea what you're planning?
me? there's not much to talk about
i need mister aventurine's comprehensive plan.
i don't need a middleman. plus, anyone who calls themself "tall, blue, and handsome" definitely can't be trusted.
i will be sending you into the simulated universe using an alternative method. it might feel a little different than usual.
flipping through this book is akin to personally listening to the guests' stories and their heartfelt wishes yes, here it is. my message.
don't worry, it's nothing i can't handle. there are more important things than titles and ranks -- finding the best solution is what matters most.
but how can i change her mind? i've tried, but she won't listen. i don't know how to get through to her
man, march seventh -- that's such a beautiful name! i'll make sure to remember it!
my people have already prepared the evidence.
as a gesture of appreciation for the astral express' continuous support for our business, the strategic investment department has prepared a gift for the crew.
now, i plan to face that shadow. in order to make amends, i want to repair the ambrosial arbor's seal and visit the high elder, to see what more i can do.
these soldiers are fully armed. obviously, they didn't hastily join the battle.
seems like a strange reason not to take a look plus, am i supposed to believe you were spring cleaning? you must be up to more forbidden research
and on that note, i'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to a few guests of the city.
however, just like grandpa said, those who excel with the sword will eventually suffer by it.
a shattered emptiness draped in the guise of desire... his existence is strikingly powerful, yet the self beneath is extraordinarily faint.
this projector is a limited-edition version custom-made for the museum -- the only one of its kind in the whole of belobog. it can produce images with a resolution of up to
aren't there other crew members we can take inspiration from?
of course. what's all the fuss about? i've done that loads of times.
so it's the power of the aeon? i see
you're not wrong, it's only been a few minutes.
miss qingque, are you alright?
but i have to say, after clearing out all those unnecessary items, i feel much more refreshed.
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
now i'm completely sure that i was on the right track from the beginning and never strayed, fool.
so are judges all loners? you don't seem to have any backup.
borisin infiltrated the prison in disguise and released the prisoners, spreading chaos.
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
aventurine? why are you still on the line?
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
things are getting back on track for belobog, but those emanators could return one day
look upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. phase through that corridor, and be careful -- do not alert the meme.
it's time, everyone. the ipc's key members and i have agreed to consult one another before the upcoming negotiation. do any of you wish to sit in?
in any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
i believe this to be phantylia's goal -- to sow seeds of doubt among us and ensnare us in a malevolent trap.
my keyboard guy is pretty good, but i still miss our military days playing in the band
you sure have a way of comforting people, mister moze.
hah, that guy. one of these days he's gonna get busted by my brother.
i'll go first to give you a demo.
two paths lost their aeons in that war -- the propagation and the order. coincidentally, their downfall is related to a certain aeon
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
well, no wonder they sought the mediation from the astral express. in your opinion, who should we stand behind?
but you know, based on my years of judging people, you don't really need to dive into swordplay to boost your skills and i doubt there's anyone out there who can really show you the way forward.
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
i heard that the ambrosial arbor shriveled and died a long time ago how could it suddenly spring back to life and start growing again?
i don't know how to offer words of comfort, nor do i know much about curing others' ailments.
did qingni tell you any of this?
but at least i have time to come visit you guys! did you miss me?
how was it? did you dream of me?
seems like you really do have no clue. turn around and take a look
truthfully, i've never heard of this stellaron.
...an anthem of beauty with me!
we've only met once. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
i've seen this type of monster a few times near the restricted zone.
this is qlipoth fort, the heart of belobog and headquarters of the architects.
really? are you doing this on purpose?
can a creation become what it wants to be? the answer is "yes"! i'll grant your wish, guyun, and transform you into something different.
those tourists just want to see some good sword fights. anyone can participate in this kind of tournament. it doesn't have to be me.
i've heard you haven't enjoyed mister aventurine's company. i also understand that you're an avid learner who sees the pursuit of knowledge above all.
heh, you're confident. good. a confident performer tends to delight the audience with surprises.
hehe, i did not expect such a short journey to be filled with so many twists and turns.
igor what a nostalgic name. i know him, actually, i should say i will always remember him. you and he are two of a kind.
my name is ruan mei. when saying my name, please don't run the syllables together.
well whatever they are, they're not good enough.
we need to be sure, serval. if we can't reach a common understanding with your brother will you stand with us?
they're eccentric, unpredictable, and fond of being alone. no wonder she's a suspect.
alas, while beauty was invoked in the depths of my heart and i vowed to remember this kindness forever, after i expressed my gratitude, we still decided to part ways.
yo, it's you! you're interested in the supernatural, right?
i'll get in touch with wildfire and the silvermane guards right away and have them investigate the matter thoroughly. but for now let's take the parts we have back to the museum, or we'll be here all night.
unlike in the sweet dream, people here don't see memory zone memes as dangerous monsters and even if they pose a threat, people can easily escape by forcing a wake-up call.
so, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the watchmaker?
if a question is of no help, then don't ask it. time is clearly precious to the both of us.
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
ha if only my colleagues had the same self-awareness as you.
in the meantime, she'll have to learn to withstand the darkness -- just as i have.
and just like that, he left. time flew by and then, in the blink of an eye, three hundred years had passed.
oh, so you're here to take part? well if we bump into each other out there you'd better be ready. this time we're gonna show you what we're really made of!
of course, if you're not yet able to confront the past
you do have some skill, but now is not a good time to try to stop me.
i am extremely interested in this. what lies behind your insistence on narrating everything from the intriguing worldview of a ninja?
i'm afraid there's no time for chit-chat -- lives could be at stake.
have some faith in me, please! even if i lose, i'll go down with dignity. you guys won't have to carry me home like last time because my legs turned into jelly!
they're both really capable and awesome people which is why i feel really pressured when i'm with them
that's right! for us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
so, it seems that some borisin have returned to stargazer navalia in disguise. the answer seems quite obvious
and that's the only cocolia you guys ever got to know, huh always ahead of everyone else, never looking back, even for a second
according to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
a full, complete flight can only be considered as such when it starts with a successful takeoff and ends with a good landing.
oh, hehe hopefully you'll be the last one i meet for a while then
regardless of why it's designed like the conductor aboard the astral express, this doll -- is it connected to the case?
so... the trial of the heart means knowing how to deal with an overbearing boss.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
pela's got a lot on her plate -- plus she also does volunteer work on the weekends sometimes. that's why we usually schedule mechanical fever's rehearsals at night.
cocolia let's settle this bad blood right here, right now!
people's lives are at stake. why wouldn't you want another person to help? besides, i have some experience with the fragmentums. i'm sure i will be of use.
to be more precise, it's been forty-five minutes. time sure flies when you're having fun, doesn't it?
the marshal is well aware of jing yuan's purpose in holding the ceremony and understands the situation he is facing. she mentioned it because she believes both issues are important.
heh, if you think you can just take this sword from my hand, go ahead and try.
of course, ashavat. go to the tartarion without worries. i'll take care of her while you're away.
using the environment to hide her traces our girl from the sky-faring commission sure knows how to put up a challenge. let's look around and see if we can find any other clues.
now i must take over the duties of the supreme guardian and discard my naive fantasies.
all the outworlders arriving at xianzhou these days start their sentences with "there's an old saying in xianzhou" but a local like me can't think up any. how can this be
i believe he was just slacking off. in my opinion, the staff members from the sky-faring commission appear more suspicious.
dear friends, please ready yourselves for this trial set forth by the beauty!
the only problem is that these miss tingyuns are too caught up in their own world. is there one we can properly speak with?
a genius from long ago. it is said that he invented ultraremote sensing and the telepathy beacon, only he signed them over to the intelligentsia guild.
why not? seems like himeko knows a lot about weapons -- guns, cannons, you name it!
hoolay's whereabouts are still unknown, and they've even taken mister jiaoqiu hostage. the longer we wait, the more complicated the situation becomes.
excuse me, is the deputy sheriff still around?
hello, misha. i'm welt, we met in a dream
your willingness to help is truly heartwarming, youngsters.
so that's how it is i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
yukong, please explain to them the rest of the arrangements.
i don't want you to feel burdened by this choice... you don't need to worry about my feelings, just go with what your heart tells you.
alright, i admit that for a few seconds there, the thought may have crossed my mind.
don't worry. i just gave them some time alone to ponder their fates.
i just want to give more room for knowledge and inspiration to grow freely.
what is the current situation on the space station?
thinking back, that trip to see the void song whales was one of the turning points which set me on the path to becoming a fighter pilot. life truly is full of wonders
or maybe you've just forgotten your age.
i've kept you waiting, mister aventurine. this way please, let us speak in private.
you asked if i view general jing yuan as my enemy no, my real enemy has always been myself.
don't be sorry. it pays to be careful.
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
alright, alright, stop with the tantrum. you're not a kid anymore.
when i stand aboard the express, i can feel that you and i are really the same -- manifesting our own futures in this universe to the best of our abilities.
momentum alone will only keep you going for about three days. if you really want to stick with it, you need a solid plan.
okay. be careful though, i sense a drop in temperature. something's not right.
that so-called prophet lied to all of you. she just sent you here to die.
let's go, benefactors, time is of the essence. we must be close.
i'm looking at the reply -- see, here. miss hanya said she's on her way.
don't worry about locked doors, benefactors, we can use the conveyor belts.
these mirage echoes, on the other hand, are vestiges of the past. if we can center and transmit the echoes, we should be able to detect any assassins hidden beneath the surface of the water.
well, isn't finding a needle in a haystack a type of puzzle-solving?
you're a luofu native, miss lingsha?
looks like we're about to enter the depths of dewlight pavilion.
that's the way! we'll be at the photography studio. see you later.
welcome, astral expressers. looks like you caught me.
what if this little charmony dove never learns to fly in the end?
this guitar i found it after going through mother's old things.
i have heard of your valiant deed in leading others to vanquish the omen of evil. though the tale bears a tinge of regret, you have undoubtedly championed beauty and justice. may idrila smile upon you.
let's wait for him in front of the loom. it's the most prominent landmark on the dock.
mm, very well.
but, if the cute forest, meadows, and little foxes hadn't started to twirl and fade away, i really might have slept for the whole day!
there are three thermic cores -- you'll need them to solve the puzzles in the victory zone. let's see what you've got!
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
ha, not interested -- i need time, not money!
while i was in the gallery of thoughts, at the entrance of the dream, i chose to completely sever the halo from myself.
stop! all of you! put down your weapons!
yancui has agreed to offer you free meals throughout the crossover.
based on these fragmented pieces of information, it seems firefly's companion betrayed her halfway and trapped her alone in this room, disappearing without a trace... but why?
if you got any broken equipment lying around you can always come find me, though i can't guarantee i'll be interested in fixing it.
as a netherworld dweller, i've already died once.
haha, i knew i could count on you!
my pleasure! friends should look out for each other. good for business.
hook, julian, and the moles all have different dreams. i don't think anyone should take them away
grandpa said to never be stingy when it comes to making friends. so, how big is your appetite?
umm, well it seems you guys have some issues to sort out. so maybe i should leave.
uh this morning? yeah, that's right. he's on urban patrol duty today, right? that's why he popped round and asked the favor.
madam ruan mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so i asked the researchers to keep things simple.
thirty years ago, my mentor served as alchemy commission's cauldron master. she recognized the emerging undercurrents and sought to cleanse the source of the disturbance.
perhaps, there will come a day when you'll willingly share your memories with me -- i eagerly await such a time.
we called for port transfer and got no response, but then someone opened the jade gate for us. when we arrived there was no one to be found, so we started to make our own way through.
now, this is interesting. a guest who doesn't come to visit but sends a message instead. what does she mean? tell me, what could be more important to her than coming here?
but to answer your question directly -- it'd take a miracle. i'll complete the jarilo-vi project no matter what obstacles i encounter.
(medicine? i heard there was a mutiny within the alchemy commission during the ambrosial arbor crisis these infiltrators must have connections within the xianzhou luofu.)
to be honest, i'm confused why none of you can understand this sword. this is quite heartrending... i've already made up my mind to take master guyun away from the xianzhou.
but, since there are so many doors here we should be able to leave through one of them
haha, of course! himeko and her collection -- more than enough reason to come visit the express.
was the seer strategist thinking of us, or thinking of the fates we're destined for?
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
so you're getting the tab?
wrong. you're the one i seek.
anyway, i convinced the shopkeeper to let him come with me.
but don't expect me to go easy! my prized aether spirit is gonna crush you!
while i was passed out, she went and caused all kinds of trouble i neglected my duty of keeping her from making a mess of things.
here, this is all i have: ninety-six million, seven hundred twenty thousand credits. take it, and bring me to your boss.
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past
you are too kind, miss. for one, i don't recognize that thing in the painting.
i'd advise double-checking your bags. word is that the family's customs procedure can be quite demanding. better to sort it out now than face issues at your hotel check-in.
thank you, guys. i almost went too far, which would have been a mistake.
while taking a walk by the lunarescent depths, i spotted general feixiao chatting with them. if you wish to visit them, you can head over there.
this is zandar. zandar one kuwabara. the first genius in history.
he's an elite officer of the silvermane guards. it wouldn't be easy to get to him. besides if he hasn't been persuaded by bronya's letter, we'd be walking right into the lion's den.
no, this is a borisin in disguise. a guard killed him before he could return to his original form.
mingxi, please ready your statement.
i see but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
i believe it's not something external, but something that originates within us, an emotion that traverses time from a certain moment of our past to reach us.
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
a long time has passed since i wielded this sword the heat of combat nearly cast me into the darkness.
by the glorious light of beauty! i never thought i would see you again. in such turbulent times, your kind faces are as spring's gentle breeze, bringing solace to my scorched heart!
haha someone write that for you?
we can't afford to have any problems during the wardance. i'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the skysplitter.
i have a feeling you're going to let her off even more.
set him up? yeah, with a job! you guys are new here, and let me tell you -- you're gonna need some cash.
this is fun! i'm impressed by your ability to come up with such interesting questions on the spot!
you want to prove to me that you hold everyone's lives in your hands, right, hoolay!?
can i really reason with you xianzhou people?
all the while accusing that galaxy ranger
i'm sure he'll reach out later and fill you in on the details
boothill was only trying to scare you, but you weren't aware of that at that time. you thought you were dying, but for the sake of your dignity, honor, and home, you stood firm and threw a punch.
the moment you stepped into the memory zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. i can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
this duke inferno is a fire demon from fetora. he's an energy lifeform, and it's rumored that his birth is related to a certain genius...
that's enough pretending. please be quiet.
in pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe, huh? in that sense, you astral expressers and i are cut from the same cloth.
actually, i was just talking to myself i don't think this question can be answered.
i'm sorry we have an understanding. i stand with them.
she told me that you salvaged the forgotten hall's memories with great skill, that you are a rare talent.
i'm a traveling merchant, i've been here many times. now, for a cloud knight to be unfamiliar with the local topography
who i am, where i'm from, my name it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
bronya said we could trust you completely.
so, within your esteemed data bank, knowledge is reduced to mere bytes and bits?
ahem, that's enough praise for now anyway, if you did want to continue working as a part-time manager and handle the daily operations of the history-culture hall, i recommend talking to miss eris.
the audition process is simple. you need only answer a few questions. of course, i won't be judging based on your answers alone. i will be watching your every move on camera.
have a little faith! it's like i said: "sampo never lets friends who've helped him come to harm." hehe
sure enough, no one knows about miss robin. i'm not surprised.
no i don't need to go to the bathroom anymore.
however, hoolay's demise might actually be a blessing in disguise. broadcasting this news could derail the borisin's resurgence and quash the ambitions of those who wished to take advantage of his return.
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
let's wait for pela together. she's in the storage room.
please go ahead, general. but keep in mind we can only answer based on what we know. and perhaps you already have the answers to your questions in your heart.
there's something you should know. we were able to locate you within this boundless dream and find the key to breaking free from the dream, all because of one person's unwavering dedication...
becoming a parent often means we become obstinate. to erode a rock, one must be patient and persistent, like water.
until then, i will do my best to fulfill my duty as a passenger.
as i said, i'm a healer, but my art of healing requires the culinary arts to be truly effective.
children tend to be fascinated by such paradoxes. i was no exception.
i finished browsing through this booklet while you were replying to messages. it recorded the lives of a few genius society members -- i'd say it contains some interesting information.
no, she was still mad at me, so she didn't come by. if she had come with you, she wouldn't be a suspect right now.
isn't it just like cooking food over an open flame? if the house is a pot, then the heater is the stove it rests on.
on the title page is written "qian ketong" is that someone's name? a codename? i think it's the name of the owner of this book.
this is a big town. where should we start?
"the express has lots of express friends, and it wants to find them and play together."
as a nameless who's always on the road, constantly meeting with various characters -- don't these encounters become wearisome?
greetings. i need to speak to the general about something.
researchers' disappearances you say yes, i've heard the responsibility of sorting out that mess has been thrust upon arlan, head of the security department.
then be careful. there are still legion remnants in the area.
w--we found it strange ourselves when the gate opened but no one came to greet us.
the astral express! i must confess that the train's reputation precedes it, such that it is often close to my thoughts. how delightful to come face to face with its passengers!
and, we still don't have the coordinates and location of the stellaron.
i understand -- i'm scared too! i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
as you already know, the simulated universe will be shut down temporarily. it will remain shut until herta and i come to a clear conclusion.
remember, we should stay vigilant. we know very little about this world.
correction: there may be a correlation.
i'm sorry. i can't let you regain your ability to feel just yet. you'd be in excruciating pain.
careless answers mean distrust and potential hostility, which would make things much harder for us.
it appears so. i'm not sure what he's trying to say though.
you two go ahead, i'll wait here. the xianzhou has some interesting literature -- i'd like to get better acquainted.
uh just making conversation -- i wanted you to know i was still here.
i am, in fact, after the watchmaker's legacy, but that doesn't mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. but at least i hope things won't turn out that way.
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands
great. curiosity is the foundation of science. now, we can't just think about it. we should also act. i want to give you the chance to participate in this project. let's work together.
the complex locality of this world has been affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
i'm not entirely sure what it all means. maybe mister gallagher can shed some light on it?
haha, cut miss carmella some slack! let's turn our attention to my next opponent!
and to make things worse, another group of visitors just entered the depths of the shackling prison, the messengers from the xianzhou yaoqing.
please let me see your boss? pleaaaase?
piled up with these cheap baubles.
you mentioned the stellaron
it's like a sudden storm that appears on a calm ocean. this phenomenon causes the smooth journey through the expanse to be filled with dangers.
you don't believe i can win, so you came here to boost the chances of team belobog winning the wardance, right?
if this is what they want, i'm always up for a challenge!
i'm the least accomplished in swordplay, but i came out unscathed. i really ought to thank my masters for taking all the blows on my behalf.
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
huh!? are you being sarcastic or something?
accept your defeat, you are bested.
seems like that guest's perspective didn't resonate with you either.
in our hometown, many of us have heard of igor haft's heroic tale, but we don't know what he really went through during his journey beyond the sky. please, you have to tell me his story!
oh! it's you two again. this is the third time today we've run into each other.
sometimes what's in your heart doesn't need to be dressed up in words. maybe he already knows what you wanted to say.
let's go, sam sampo?
i've only glimpsed it a few times, but it's as magnificent as i remember
"beneath the lunar glow adorned, vidyadhara eggs begin to form, and from the ancient sea rebirthed, to walk again on solid earth."
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
sorry, but could you give me a few more minutes?
lady fu xuan has such refined taste? the xianzhou really has changed a lot in the time i've been asleep.
forty% sixty-five% eighty-five%
um, maybe we can talk about that later
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
but one thing is for certain this little fella is not under remote control. he's operating entirely of his own accord
look how happy they are! it's clear they trust you a lot.
one hundred ninety-one multiplied by three hundred eighty-three.
your creativity has proven interesting. however, i have nothing to do with your quarrel with the space station. ergo: i won't stop you.
logic: the average pathstrider wouldn't leave any trace behind in the garden of recollection's mirror.
mister yang, one moment, please.
the harmony needs a new direction. only by bidding farewell to the past can we actually sail into the future.
it seems more than a little reckless to charge in when we don't know what's ahead of us.
well, i only recently found out about it.
i don't remember when i started wielding it.
interesting analogy. perhaps that's why penacony's "beautiful dream" has persisted for so long.
come on numby, we've got some assessing to do.
come on, step forward and strike with the sword in the most natural way you can think of! it's important for us to grasp your natural movements, so we can decide where to start and what you need to learn.
a truly miraculous discovery -- perhaps i should offer you the chance to join the genius society?
time is running out, miss hanya. if we keep delaying, those borisin will escape from the prison.
if fate allows and you're interested, upon our next meeting, we could journey to no man's land and traverse its tranquil glaciers
if there are questions you want kafka to answer, now's the time.
unlike those random low-level fragmentum creations, this one seems to have a mind of its own. it seems to be able to use complex tactics.
the ancestors of the luofu people consumed the fruits of the ambrosial arbor and gained endless lifespans -- thus becoming long-life species.
it will be very difficult to bring this concept to reality using belobog's current technology.
humans overestimate the infallibility of logic, and in clinging to reason can become slaves to their emotions. science is born from fanaticism -- it is a gift.
you've been on the xianzhou for this long and you've never heard of the ten-lords commission?
so you have high compatibility with the express. that's good.
off you go now, head to the prep zone and ready yourselves -- i'd hate to see you disappoint her!
is this a notebook?
spending time with herta, screwllum, and stephen is enough to wear one out.
if she can tell me more about dan feng's actions, then perhaps i can do something to make up for his sins.
take it. remember these names -- find a friend who's tuned in to the gossip around here and tell them you want to know the relationship between these people.
uh, this is
your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
i understand, but i must protect those that believe in the architects
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to
(hold on this would've been too quick a route.)
let me introduce our guests to you. the one dressed in green
mister gallagher, my patience is wearing thin. neglecting duties
alright, i'll take you out of the stargazer navalia.
yes. i've already checked the astral charts -- the two nearest worlds to us are the oceanic planet of lushaka and the agate world, melustanin.
that won't be necessary. i've memorized every detail.
your courage and curiosity are truly moving. the one and only and i await your arrival.
this must be the first high elder that accepted the mission to quell the ambrosial arbor
hmm "wander the world with them." it sounds like lady bailu would've been an ideal target -- she's always running off to play in aurum alley.
so was this your choice? to respond to my request for help?
haha, judging by this fellow's surprised reaction, you must be the one herta is always talking about.
for sure. you have a unique constitution and a lot of potential. with your strength, wielding a baseball bat is no problem at all.
well, you guys sure know how to argue your case
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
whoa! nice! there were no witnesses, so this never happened, alright?
i hope you can see that everything we do, we do to rebuild trust and make belobog work for all.
i see. let's find helm master yukong -- we'll accompany you
wherever the fiery giant treads, scorched earth follows. yet, it's those consumed by unending fire... who, after the flames vanish, quietly hold the ashes in their lonesome embrace.
the guards can give you some time before the next wave of attacks is upon us.
sorry, my bad but it's not too late! you can order anything you want!
my brother has always been my protector, and i've never contemplated stepping out of his shadow yet even though we may take different paths, i am still his little sister.
what's important is that we still don't have the exact location and coordinates of the stellaron. nor have we figured out the reason behind cocolia's sudden change in attitude.
it's yanqing's sword -- i saw him wield it one time when i was doing drills with the cloud knights.
i saw some memory fragments drifting outside the window, and i intend to salvage them.
alas, questions like that are above my pay grade. that is for the ten lords and the general to figure out.
indeed, i should be reviewing files in the palace of astrum. however, qingni decided to put herself in danger and trouble our esteemed guests with her safety as her mother, i couldn't sit idly by.
the trailblaze can illuminate the way, but ultimately, the future of a world belongs to those who live in it.
wah wah wah so annoying.
oh... did madam herta send you to help?
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
wen shiling said adler kept muttering about a "phrase" before he disappeared.
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
since you came as promised, learned doctor does this mean that you are willing to take the side of the family in this farce?
what? you want to secretly practice swordplay by yourself? dream on.
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes truly are sorrowful.
lady asta bought ergonomic chairs for everybody, but i feel like there's still room for improvement. cushions like this one might actually be the missing piece.
let's hurry back to fyxestroll garden now, while there's still a chance to turn things around. it's time to teach cirrus a lesson.
it's alright, i've got gepard with me -- we'll be safe. see you in a bit!
all things are impermanent, this departure may be our final farewell. may your way of the ninja be ever courageous and enduring. until we meet again!
hello, friend. how have you been? i sincerely hope you don't mind.
your behavior truly is puzzling i can't seem to piece together your motive.
he heard that the miners and vagrants had begun to engage in a large-scale conflict he wanted to stop everyone from getting hurt fighting over the mines.
is that so... you're good then. what sort of training did you have to undergo? can you teach me?
really? i get the feeling he doesn't like to talk
is that all the evidence? how are we meant to solve this with so little to go on
time is running out. we need to hurry.
the repulsion bridge has been shut down?
what do you think should be done to put an end to it, general?
oh, really? but i never guess wrong.
i'll take you to fill in the paperwork tomorrow. you'll start as ground crew, just like caiyi and i did. i believe that one day you'll make an outstanding fighter pilot.
glowswather you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
don't worry, cassidy -- wildfire's on the case. you just rest up here, and don't let this ruin your day!
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
yeah. i've fixed a lot of things before, but i never had to repair one as complicated as this.
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
you know, it was difficult for me to believe you. some of the words you use are too alien for those that have lived their entire life in belobog.
cirrus's will to fight has been shattered -- they can no longer pose a threat. considering that everything here is now under control, i'll take my leave.
me? none. what cocolia and the architects get up to has nothing to do with me. my time is too precious for pondering.
during the course of finding memories, a picture is worth a thousand words.
regrettably, mister taoran, the skysplitter only hosted cloud knights today, no audience.
actually, i want to talk to you about our little lynx.
it's like it's been erased? who's done this
i sent over some evidence regarding the prison break in the shackling prison. i trust you've already looked it over.
now that the stellaron crisis is over, we've been able to allocate more manpower to the renovation works. the museum should be open to the public again soon.
come quick! i've brought you a shiny little thing. open up the box and take a look!
clara, we'll help you investigate what's going on with the robots.
you're saying that the ipc is in it for the ipc, but we just want what's best for aurum alley
i don't fight because i like violence, or want to win the championship, or to show off to anyone i just think there are too many thugs in the underworld and the kids need a good example.
that cursed sword has messed with your ability to think, but i'll break you free from its grip! i'll shatter its illusion and the sword itself!
it's okay! phew, this one's strong alright!
you were a great help to folks on the space station -- my job was so much easier with you around.
tingyun would ask me to write introductory pieces for blades when her codex on goods contains a section on them.
...maybe if i change peppy's diet, he won't shed so much...
oh, you are here. i've been looking for you up and down the train.
she must have been worried. i'll return to the train and put her mind at rest.
but those things are all in the past.
i would imagine the curio is the creation of a genius. affirmation: it holds some special meaning to herta.
miss march has been learning the basics of swordplay, and now it's time to put her knowledge to the test.
the cloud knight general and the ten-lords commission. they performed regular inspections of scalegorge waterscape
never met her in the flesh. but who in belobog wouldn't know of her?
ah her? how is this possible?
now that things have settled down, i finally have time to pay the express a visit.
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
just press the button when you're at your wit's end. and of course, feel free to reach out to me for my "hospice care" too!
you have a superior strategy? pray tell. do we set the two of them loose, turning whispered fears into full-blown pandemonium?
blade, on the other hand, is a wanted criminal for the xianzhou -- he must remain with us.
it was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. with regards to the annihilation gang i can also prove that what aventurine said was the truth.
if we don't recover the sword, we will be breaking our promise to the luofu and betraying the delegation. we're counting on you to find the truth, official dahao.
"one of the healers from the alchemy commission had lady bailu cornered, but then she disappeared into thin air"
*sigh* it's been such a long journey, but now we're finally gonna meet some cloud knights! i'll be back with my unit!
see, it's still in the space station. like screwllum said, it cannot escape from here.
if i'm right, he intends to use it to track your location or contact you when needed. as it so happens, this may actually be of some use in the current situation.
there's nothing personal in it -- have a read if you like.
definitely not the kind of thing you'd expect to find on a ship like this.
it's a cinch. this music box -- the "invitation" received by the annihilation gang there are latent memories that linger on it yet.
their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
no problem, come find me any time.
the next day, i hitched a ride with an ipc transport vessel and arrived on the xianzhou luofu.
here's a slice of life experience for you: resourceful businessmen never get into risky trading without a plan b and a plan b for their plan b. plan c, we call that.
excellent! i wasn't wrong about you. your skills, wisdom, and courage embody the beauty of a martial artist.
not quite yet. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
are you sure?
svarog wants to preserve humanity, but he's not concerned about what humans truly think.
his behavior says something about his thinking: "as long as everyone's been driven out, the conflict is over."
you have a very distinct scent. losing one sense forces the other senses to become sharper.
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
perhaps another time when i'm not here? jokes like this make my head hurt, to put it mildly.
huh reminds me of the accusations against me. cocolia's methods haven't changed.
allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
i suppose you mean you're in good shape? yes, the cast welcomes newcomers who are hardworking and persevering.
humans traverse the path of fate... seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist...
the eternal land, amphoreus.
until then, rest assured that i will behave as expected of a passenger.
memokeeper do you think you can just leave?
i guess the love and care for the alley brought everyone together, and that's why despite all the difficulties, things turned out for the best.
i must uncover the reason why mikhail cut ties with the family, and who exactly it was who betrayed us all. do you remember our arrangement, mister micah? well, here's my answer
what if you're just using this as a chance to escape?
save your breath. we'll know the truth once the cloud knights send you to the ten-lords commission's judges.
the value of items housed here can't be measured in money alone but this little piece of stone could fetch a mountain of cash.
more manpower is always a good thing, since the skysplitter is so large. oh, and by the way, you should know that--
"forsake what others fight for and take what others abandon. that's the way to navigate the world and achieve my goals." i will continue to uphold my principles.
you're right maybe we should contact miss qingque and warn her not to go to work today.
the express travels to so many worlds, it's hard to avoid running into difficult situations. having more skills can give you more protection.
your troops will be unfamiliar with the layout of the mine -- i'll send some of my men to be your guides.
of course. who could imagine that death would actually descend upon the idyllic dream created by the family, let alone that the victim would be the female lead of the charmony festival...
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
thank you for accompanying me through all this, mister yang. this farewell journey has come to an end.
you might be right, but well, this is kinda embarrassing to say, but i'm not sure if i've improved or not.
i've hunted down hundreds of swords like this so far, and every single one of them has been melted down!
it's okay dad, because you're the best.
in my opinion, the unknown is no more terrifying than the known in fact, the unknown signifies something we can control and change.
i am glad to finally meet you in person, guests from the astral express. i'm feixiao, the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
yes. i found an anonymous handwritten journal while i was cleaning up -- it mentioned thirty-six different strategies for relieving pressure. that's where i read about the trials.
mm, make sure you've got everything you need.
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
imbibitor lunae, if memories are returning to you, share them.
only someone like her is worthy of the astral express. i think himeko's vision of her whole life revolves around a very important dream.
you may not be young, but your mindset is still that of a fresh-faced newbie who spends all their time on work, while proudly proclaiming to "love their job."
but being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. we must make a decision, no matter what.
you'll step out of your comfort zone to set forth on adventures into uncharted territories.
by the way, the ambassador from kalevala and that knight went to aurum alley. they're looking for a spot to honor the hero. why don't we go take a look together?
back already? you've met with jing yuan and wandered around for a few hours. so, what do you think?
if she doesn't want to reveal the commission's secrets, then you have no choice but to wait.
i'm sorry, but it might take some time to get used to that. after all you are a senior.
i'm just gonna take them to the dining carriage let's go, numby!
well anyway, there's a dangerous situation at the divination commission at the moment, so just don't go in there!
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
right! let's call it a day. and you too, judge hanya -- don't work yourself to death.
do you still remember where it was filed, miss qingni?
the next step would be to ignite the spark. look at those researchers who disappeared -- what would happen if someone realized their similarities? i need to say no more.
i just hope everything is smooth-sailing from now on -- please look after me.
i appreciate each case has its difficulties, but if i treated every late debtor as a "special case," the galaxy's economy would come to a grinding halt.
the vagrants or, to be more accurate, the majority of people in the underworld regard robots as nothing more than tools.
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
it's a trial. you got to prove your worth to sunday before you can speak with him.
the doomsday beast can rip off the defense shield like tearing paper -- and herta's not here. the station's defenses are too weak to stand against the antimatter legion.
and the other big heroes, dan heng and march seventh!
whoever is providing them with official identities must hold a position of power let's search elsewhere.
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency
but himeko told me that if the silvermane guards do go ahead with it, she'll be glad to help.
this stool is a piece of evidence, right?
both my words and actions come from the bottom of my heart. you are indeed beautiful -- like flowers blooming in the morning sun!
so should we tell everyone the deal?
you care about other people's opinions too much.
whenever she's back on the space station, madam herta assigns me things outside the security department remit.
kyle, can i ask you a favor? i would like you to visit the residence of minister noel and ask around regarding the whereabouts of mister norbert.
but only someone from the six commissions could bring the stellaron into the xianzhou undetected, let alone plant it within the ambrosial arbor
mister gallagher likes to keep his softer side hidden, and even though he might seem a little disorganized at times, he's always there for his friends when it matters most.
yes. that's where the main force of the silvermane guards is stationed. they've consolidated their position there in order to resist the encroaching fragmentum.
they will soon realize the situation. when old oti answered the last question, he represented more than just the alfalfa family.
you sound confused.
when it comes to swords, you you and your father are cut from the same cloth.
igor, a tall and red-haired boxer, appeared in the ring. every swing of his fists felt like it carried the weight of an entire world.
could the murals in our vicinity be related to the seals?
if anyone out there ever managed to strike a deal with svarog, they'd earn my heartfelt admiration!
the council of mundanites should consider you as their member, for no one in this universe is more suitable to be there than you.
have you not sensed it yet? this apparent land of dreams it's a carefully designed dream maintained by the family through unknown means.
slumbernana monkey? i see a tag on it: "peelin' richie, fortune academy."
but i choose to believe you, and my trust in you stems more from my own personal judgment.
i'm trying to capture all these moments in my mind, that way i'll have them with me even when i'm not on the express.
belobog oh! i think lil gui mentioned it before, but i can't seem to remember. what kind of place is it?
that's right -- we can't really know what a heliobus is thinking, right? tail was sealed away for ages and then suddenly let free if it were me, i'd want some away time.
unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme she was completely lost in the memory zone.
you've heard of this military tactic, right? when you surround your enemy, leave one side open for them to escape. a skilled hunter must be well-prepared, waiting for the prey at the most advantageous position.
it's empowering, looking out at a world from a window like this
hmm, this bronya is really different from the bronya i remember.
that's right. this way, the game that you so carefully orchestrated is now "pointless," is it not? there's no point in a game if it's no longer fun.
just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
even among the fools i know, miss sparkle's sense of humor stands out from the rest.
anyway, let's head over to the palace of astrum -- best not to keep yukong waiting.
extraordinary and enjoyable in equal measure! encountering an opponent of your caliber proves the existence of "the beauty."
the light here why is it still on? this place has clearly been abandoned for a long time
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
seems like you have a good handle on the situation. i see now why you made captain at such a young age, haha!
let's keep moving. watch out for monsters.
dan heng and lingsha, i'll need both of you to accompany me on this challenging journey.
you're asking him to stay here?
i thought this is just the kind of thing that'd get written into your "script".
hah, now that would be something but on a merchant ship, load, security, and sterilization take precedence over creature comforts
are you worried about those two? welt is with them. they should be fine.
wow, that's really nice of you!
oh, no. he's completely captivated by the power of that cursed sword.
i've seen the ipc's approach -- they prioritize efficiency and a standard uniform business model across the galaxy.
so many stars who are they shining for?
whatever your reasons are, you're planning to take the cursed sword away from the xianzhou! hand it over to me!
i wrote to my mom about the recent monster-slaying and demon-fighting stuff i've been doing for the ten-lords commission.
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
doesn't look like it wants to let us through. do you think if i yell at it i could scare it off?
i'll restrict her movements -- dan heng, clear her creations!
don't sell yourself short. we're not fundamentally opposed. otherwise, you wouldn't have shown me mercy in front of the dreammaster.
like master, like student i admire your attitude. in any case, if this concerns the fragmentum, then there's no time to lose. where are the monsters? lead the way.
i'm glad you don't mind. natasha is always cautious, but she has no ill intent, as you surely have noticed.
do you still believe that the order only seeks to control the universe as their puppet, himeko?
i always had a feeling that you would never give up on someone who needed help. after spending time with you, i'm even more convinced of this assessment.
pay no mind to the matters concerning the xianzhou. penacony isn't the final stop on our trip. we have plenty of time. once everything is packed up, i will naturally catch up with all of you.
belobog! i've heard of it from others no wonder your metal arm looks so awesome. master, you must be here to compete in the wardance, right?
drifting memory fragments
they do. the architects believe that hell can exist on any world -- a plight that will inevitably come to be without intervention.
if it were up to me i'd probably agree to the ipc's conditions.
objectively speaking, aside from some minor spiritual trauma, no researchers were hurt in this attack which never aligned with the annihilation gang's modus operandi.
well, it means you'll soon end up like her, unable to speak ever again.
you already accessed the recordings?
sure, how couldn't i have? it's not often we find such moments to reunite and enjoy one another's presence.
i later saw you walking into the same room, so i began to connect the dots. the situation got a bit tense... i hope you don't mind that i pulled this stunt.
despite all the hardships elder huaiyan has faced, he still finds joy in the world. he is an example every general should follow.
that's precisely why this sweet dream in penacony exists.
we're running out of time, let's retrace our steps and evaluate the situation. from the data we've collected, there are three avenues we can explore
oh, that's the furnace core, and it's also the pillar that connects the underworld and the overworld. people used to travel up and down that thing, but then
jeez, you sure do love to procrastinate.
no matter, it'll just require a bit more work to get through.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
i understand what pela really feels. you don't need to hide it.
rest assured, cocolia may have changed over the years but she'd never hurt bronya. i'm certain of that.
"the family's esteemed guests are cordially invited to penacony to participate in our grand celebration." that's why we're here in the first place.
anyway, there's only one more step in my training plan. come on guys, help me wrap it up!
i have my own ways. that's all you need to know.
it's probably these mechs causing the trouble.
please, lady fu, i still have forces to deploy.
we still have a chance, though. to make it happen... please, black swan, guide us to those with a strong will.
your good intentions are commendable, just like the cloud knights' determination to eliminate those abominations. even though there are always people who remain skeptical, i won't question your motives.
failure doesn't mean weakness. only the strong can gather the will to resist the order and try to break free.
so i've been running a fool's errand this whole time.
the lighting on the express is perfect for observations. great views at the windows too.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me
mister svarog chose not to get rid of it. isn't that the most convincing proof?
hmph, i may not be as well-read as you, but my mom taught me a thing or two!
do you mean have you, by any chance, heard of igor haft?
that's why i'm willing to stake my "topaz stone" to cover for you it's like one big elaborate game of chess.
me? scared? hahaha, my friends, what do i have to fear? *gasp* surely i haven't done anything to offend you?
notions of rules and equal competition are mere illusions. now, if you don't mind, allow me to show you how the endgame is played.
mister oleg, please entrust the silvermane guards with the rescue.
it's as the bloodhound said: corrective measures will be enforced.
interesting duo, haha! guess they must keep you pretty entertained, huh?
of course not! adventures are exhilarating, but rest and recuperation is equally important.
step into the mortal world to see how it truly is.
chief oleg he didn't say much, but i know he's not the kind to wear his heart on his sleeve.
pela why did you suddenly want to come camping?
oh, nothing. i was just reminded of some old friends and old tales.
outsiders, seele, the second wave hasn't started yet. make the most of this opportunity and make a break for it!
i'm forbidden from setting foot on the luofu. "total interception of any attempt to enter the dominion." *sigh* let's head back to the main carriage.
but the merchant guild refused to cooperate with the major shops in aurum alley, and the once prosperous dock is now desolate.
an unexpected calamity don't you think?
i have no objections. after all, "trading" and "training" are all part of aetherium wars. i say why not put the coin to good use?
halovians are often seen as subjects of the harmony, listening to people's prayers in the world on behalf of them. whether those wishes come true or not, they will be woven into xipe's divine music.
haha, you flatter me! the express has visited many worlds. i'm sure the nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
looks like you have yet to forgive me i understand.
anything you recommend is fine.
when the childrens' parents are away in the mines, the clinic becomes a kind of nursery haha, to be fair, it's me who invites them. perhaps i need them more than they need me.
this place is an endless stream of people where do we start?
hee-hee, i knew it! this is what people like us live for. let's go!
there's an accounting book lying on the ground. it must have been specially placed there by sparkle.
don't let her carefree nature fool you -- she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
if the guards had a train like this, would it make our campaigns easier?
so i asked myself, why were they so eager to run toward their death after they had recovered from their wounds? why wouldn't they value their hard-won life? all the doubts left me feeling lost
what, can't grasp the concept? i'd wager you haven't opened a real book in your life.
while you were chasing the enemy, the security department also found the missing researchers. affirmation: they are all safe and sound.
it is cute, unique, and quite charming. i wish to wear it on my armor, as a badge of honor.
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
doing so would clear the misunderstanding between us, reveal the true intentions of the stellaron hunters, and help us understand their connection to the stellaron burst. what say you, my astral guests?
why so surprised? you're still young and full of energy. i'm pretty sure you'll live a few more decades. have some confidence in yourself!
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
speaking of which, does the express have a place specifically for storing weapons?
uhh, that is unless you're thinking of a different himeko?
great, and it's barely damaged! nat wouldn't have expected her old supplies from years ago to have stayed in such good condition.
although some basic options should include meal for one, meal for two, and family meal.
my rational mind tells me no, yet my heart tells me to believe.
i understand, but the sound of the shutter and the camera bulb might send it into a frenzy
our people? or someone from the ipc?
that was a personal request from the head of the iris family, and it has nothing to do with us. step aside and stop causing trouble for the charmony festival.
i have nothing against desserts. the only reason i made that rule is so that people can learn to wait in line in an orderly manner for things instead of shoving and jostling people around.
*sigh* i'm afraid there are still official matters to attend to. i must be leaving soon.
the alliance has been trying to root out their secret organization for millennia -- it's no coincidence that they've chosen this moment to reveal themselves.
oh please -- you've barely sat still since they left.
unlock? an eloquent and picturesque choice of words, yet you have already set forth on the path of beauty
but as a descendant of the vidyadhara, i will fulfill my duty to the luofu.
on the planet of festivities, whatever identities i once had, they no longer matter.
but mister svarog doesn't like talking to others, especially wildfire
i apologize for the unfortunate interruption. let us move on with the ceremony.
these records remind me of something my mother once said to me -- "can civilizations built by humans really stand against the will of gods?"
well, this invasion seems to be nothing more than a random provocation. as soon as the doomsday beast fell, the legion retreated.
after his revival, bladie had forgotten nearly everything, but he remembered the night his apprentices killed him. he's been searching the whole universe for those who took his life
i smelled the scent of anxiety on you, so i used the zhuming's sleeping powder and flame ambergris, mixed with sunset cinders, to make an incense called "forget all worries." let me share some with you.
i can't believe that happened to miss robin "the strong defending the weak" is a great mantra, but if i had to pay such a price i, i don't know what i'd do
yeah you could be right about that. is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
of course, if you want to get to the nitty-gritty, it's not that simple this project has encountered plenty of hiccups along the way. it wasn't all smooth sailing.
i hope that the express crew will look after dan heng.
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around
(march, you don't have to add in combat scenes while you're figuring out where to take the story -- we can wait.)
now that the stellaron is sealed, the eternal freeze will slowly recede. the fragmentum won't aggressively expand anymore, but nor will it disappear. jarilo-vi has a chance to return to life, but it will take time
but i see what you're doing reverse psychology, huh?
our destination is the commercial district. that's where the largest crowds gather in dreamflux reef. we might be able to find the others there.
the judges will use a complicated interrogation device called the karmic mirror. it accurately tracks every physiological change during questioning and records it.
if you see her, be sure to keep your distance and notify me immediately.
the last time i saw her, she was preparing to meet someone on the snow plains. she even asked for a stove set from me
...sure, but the security department already combed through their backgrounds and personal relationships -- we didn't find anything odd. the annihilation gang are a group of diehard thugs -- they might be attacking indiscriminately...
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do
let's focus on the business at hand first. we shouldn't disrupt himeko and mister yang while they're dealing with the stellaron. let's talk once we're back on the express.
this again don't tell me, it's gotta be
even if i dared to refuse, i wouldn't know how. she's just... too overbearing.
many of the cursed swords i've destroyed had honorable and grand names too. a legendary sword and a butcher's knife are often just different ways of describing the same thing.
who you are is a question that only you can find the answer to
oh, sorry, i was thinking out loud. don't worry, the express is perfectly safe -- there are no... come to think of it, i'm an unregistered visitor.
once she's finished with admiring the scenery, she'll personally come and apologize to the both of you.
the situation has changed completely. without the assistance of a judge, continuing would place all of you in grave danger -- defeating the purpose of the squad.
as a cloud knight, i can't just sit back and do nothing when i see civil unrest. and for your information, my name isn't "little miss feisty" -- it's sushang!
however, due to an order that was given many years ago, nobody has moved between the overworld and the underworld in a long time.
you'll have to forgive my colleague here -- people skills aren't his strong suit. please don't take it to heart.
miss bronya -- if you'll permit me to call you that -- i'd like to share a story with you from my own life.
what's wrong, gepard? ahh, i see can't let go of your dear ol' sister, eh?
these things showing up in the shackling prison can only mean one thing
oh, how should i know! it's up to you, you have so many options to choose from. maybe jump out a hatch, or hop into the fragmentum and see if any monsters start worshiping you?
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
a great show will start soon, old man. but before that, i need to ask you something. do you know where i can find "death" in this dream?
the conclusion of a journey can often be sorrowful. all we can do is try to make sure it ends on a happy note.
i don't know. before i could figure out what was going on, it spat me out
i know it's hard to believe, but ever since i forged this sword, i've been able to hear the thoughts of all sorts of weapons.
are you leaving? this old town is too dangerous. we'll accompany you part of the way.
she was also asking after you, dan heng. i think it'd be best for you to update her in person, don't you think?
sure enough! these parts are from the museum's sculpture!
allow me to introduce him to you: this is boothill, a galaxy ranger.
come, let's take a look around the contestant hall.
according to oleg, he's a robot that took part in the war of defense over seven hundred years ago. he possesses a near-human intelligence, and rules over all the machinery in the underground
i am just a healer, and i've always hated those who play political games. but if you want to gain a foothold in the alchemy commission, you must have some means to stop those who abuse their power.
heh, all i did was calm that thing inside you down temporarily
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
this is my original appearance, that of the vidyadhara don't worry, i'm still dan heng, a descendant of the vidyadhara, and also a member of the nameless.
the tag on the tie reads "only for imperial master lefton" seems like it's one of miss sparkle's personal belongings.
hmm did you notice the flagstone the creature was stepping on? i wonder if it has any connection to the seal
and when people no longer blindly follow slumbernana monkey, we will be able to easily destroy this dreamscape.
y'know, i never guessed you'd become a pro at this job -- i only wanted you to experience the fun of working here
the conclusion put simply, i don't believe that the draught of draconic surge holds the cure to the mara. even in the foreseeable future, there will likely not be any such cure.
however, i maintain that the voice carries greater emotional charge than the written word.
they were acquired legitimately, that's all i can say. take them, they're very useful in combat.
all the painstaking effort that miss sparkle put into it -- how could i ever miss it?
i heard that residents of the xianzhou have extremely long life spans, which would require them to make great efforts to preserve their mental health meaning
there is only a fine line between resurrection and escaping death, yet they couldn't be more different. if you had truly died, i would have been powerless to do anything for you.
there is an increasing number of monkeys. it seems like we are getting closer and closer to the core of this dreamscape.
"the family's protection for penacony has expired. any mishaps in the dreamscape could result in permanent brain death."
looks like she's done with her questions
the family believes in the harmony, and their altruism is well-known across the stars -- a trait that is intimately tied to penacony's stability and prosperity.
one cannot help but wonder how many luofu generals this fragment of ignamar will face in times to come. speaking purely from the perspective of a warrior, i must say i feel somewhat envious.
today's work is finished! please make sure to get some rest!
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
if you had no intention to trespass, then why did you return to the xianzhou ship before your exile was lifted?
lady... lead researcher asta immediately began to organize the evacuation. i was supposed to cover everyone as they evacuated, but... i didn't expect to end up failing in this task.
it's a pleasure to join you all in celebrating the grandest ceremony of the amber era, the charmony festival. firstly, on behalf of the penacony family's five major lineages
more important than this?
mister sunday wants to join us on the express. of course, i can't make that decision alone.
thank you. choose whoever you like. wildfire will take care of the rest.
there was a moment when i felt the invisible thing was r--right in front of me
your powers of perception are impressive, that's all -- i think you're the right person for the job.
yes. there are other concerns besides those i've mentioned.
that part is true. i'm always calculating when it comes to business, but never with people.
general huaiyan, the sky-faring commission has finished its preparations. do you have any other instructions?
oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
the sliver of trust they have for me has to do with the last one
i don't know how exactly, but huohuo manages to keep that tail of hers in check, even though she's terrified of heliobi it proves she's got some serious talent!
(can you tell him to be less aggressive?)
i admire your confidence. but what was it you said earlier about declaring a winner before swords were drawn?
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
(oh, almost forgot about that title page he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
ah! i remember now! it's the armillary sphere. there's a shape on it that really looks like pom-pom!
let me guess, you're someone who doesn't follow the rules, enjoys improvising, and can handle yourself well against tough foes. am i right?
what can i say sounds like a lynxy expedition alright.
lone voyagers in the cosmos are driven by two desires: to tread in the trails of the past, and to forge their own way. but under their scrutiny... most end up adhering to the former.
...is that so? i haven't been able to shake off this familiar feeling since just now... maybe this is what they call deja vu, hehe. or it could purely be serendipity.
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
for now, i suggest you forget about that and enjoy your victory, you've earned it after all!
the pharmacology of this draught of draconic surge is peculiar. i'll need time to run a thorough analysis. when i have a conclusive answer, i'll contact you immediately.
"water of the ancient sea, upon high elder's command, subdue the eternal roots."
as for the ambrosial arbor crisis, all i need to do is listen. general feixiao will be the one asking the questions. to be honest, i'm more concerned about the timely start of the wardance.
whether it's us merging or one of us disappearing, i'll leave the tuning to fate, and see if i can embrace all that i detest.
the father of penacony, mikhail char legwork, one of the legendary nameless who laid the foundations of penacony!
you can talk to me if you've something on your mind. in this world, there's no one who heals the heart better than a memokeeper.
the hatred in one's heart might dissipate one day, but the way of the ninja within their hearts will never be forgotten ever.
y'know serval, if you're really leaving belobog for a while you should pay them a visit first.
let's open that package right here, right now -- then we'll see what he's hiding!
this fluff ball is cute, unique, and quite charming. that's why i wish to wear it on my armor, as a badge of honor.
oho, this brave little girl appears to be protecting you. i wonder why? are you two that close?
which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
hmm, afraid numby's not a fan
please allow me to apologize again for what happened in the restricted zone. you were only trying to help i should've trusted serval's judgment.
we learned from natasha that the underworld shoulders the energy needs of their entire civilization. laboring in the underworld used to be a great honor, and there was regular movement between realms.
the stellaron issue concerns the life and death of everyone on penacony. if anyone has a better suggestion, the crew is more than willing to listen. also, it'd be best to tell us the ins and outs of that meeting--
i'm not too sure
you bet i do. we go way back. he's easy to talk to. watch me persuade him.
if you are truly able to prevent our endlessly unfolding misfortunes, then the people of belobog are indebted to you.
ah? then i am most likely mistaken.
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
in the art of healing, i certainly could not compare to the luofu's high elder. but in these games of politics, i still take pride in being able to protect her.
is that so? many others have said the same. perhaps you're right.
yes. the fragmentum here seems to have made a special connection with cocolia. it's repeatedly generating forms in her image.
your flying sword? oh, so that's why i found a dagger in my bag. turns out it's yours.
now that cocolia is no more, i guess our silvermane girl is about to become the next supreme guardian?
my meeting with ninja initiate gigaku was purely happenstance, but i did not come here alone. these nameless ninjas are also my companions.
you don't intend to reveal your true identity to her?
i walked around the hotel but didn't meet a single member of the oak family on such an important day.
now that the crisis on the planet of festivities has been averted, shouldn't the astral express have departed to continue on its trailblazing journey? why have you and your companions stayed behind in penacony?
she left us a letter. hmm could this be one of those "open-in-case-of-emergency" letters? i've never gotten one of those before. should we wait until we run into something dangerous?
i hate this feeling it makes me feel powerless, like my life is within the palm of their hand, and all my efforts to fight back seem like a joke.
so, what wind has brought you to the seat of divine foresight?
oh? this was all going so swimmingly.
such is life, full of surprises. that's why you gotta seize any opportunity to take a break -- who knows when trouble will come knocking at your door.
i hesitate to call it a solution, but i might have some information that might help.
a gift from belobog's number one rock star -- you're not allowed to dislike it! or at least don't tell me if that's the case
this way, i can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
the academic conference has concluded, and the actual acting dean and teachers are back.
now that the sparring session is over, yanqing and yunli, shouldn't you politely thank general feixiao for her guidance and bury the hatchet?
which is why i treasure our friendship.
that was the mission my grandfather entrusted to me. you just relax and keep guard over the ring.
no need. march will find out sooner or later.
exploring the snow plains of course there will be all kinds of challenges along the way, but solving them is part of the fun.
you youngsters are so full of energy. i'm jealous.
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
the intelligentsia guild's doctor ratio. this assembly is quite something.
they wouldn't be partial to anyone, but would still act for the space station's benefit -- two birds with one stone.
centuries ago, an emanator of abundance besieged the luofu with the aim of taking the ambrosial arbor. they destroyed half our delves and killed most of the cloud knights.
oh? something else on your mind?
they were acting strange, so out of curiosity, we decided to follow them. it turns out that they were actually borisin disguised as foxians!
a warp trotter this is quite a rare aether spirit, but they're not very powerful -- why would those ipc folks be after it?
you might get an aching or numbing sensation, but it shouldn't be too painful do you think you can hold still?
and start listening to natasha.
these memories are enough to create a sensational hit that will destroy ambiguity and bring a close to this absurd monkey show. but before that
but with apyra as my master -- no longer!
you look distressed. is something troubling you? if so, you can figure it out for yourself.
if that's the narrative you're sticking to, then indulge me: who, pray tell, can substantiate this captivating drama?
i should reintroduce myself. my name is dan heng -- i'm the guard on the express. i also administer the train's data bank.
the foxians of the xianzhou yaoqing are known for their adventuring flying families. the most renowned of these families was that of our mutual friend's.
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete right?
oh, so it's owned by old oti himself! no wonder this ship is so lavishly decorated.
no. as long as the stellaron is active, the corrosion will continue to spread.
i'll be rooting for you in the stands! don't go losing on me now!
again i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
the landau family has had the honor and responsibility of serving the supreme guardians for generations. only by becoming a shield for the people is one worthy of the title "architect."
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
the outer components of the express may well be melting in gastric acid as we speak.
the yukong of the past was nothing like she is now -- spending her days surrounded by documents at her desk.
before any of this transpires, you have enough time to prepare.
growing up brings gains, but also losses.
that's a story for another time. nothing's more important than ensuring the safety of the countless people on this land of dreams.
in his field, screwllum is trying to establish new laws. i prefer to call such a person a monarch, rather than a genius.
right. i have two friends here who want to come with me. any seats left inside?
and would this ongoing affair not be part of such an endeavour? perhaps this is all nothing more than a game she's decided to play with us
no need to be all formal. today i'm just a guest on the luofu, the same as all of you.
i'll let you make three moves.
topaz disappeared after leaving rivet town. in her absence, her subordinates flooded in and took over.
ah, i remember now. the minister of transportation, noel, has a nephew named norbert -- i believe he's currently working in the municipal department as a transportation coordinator.
whatever the case, we'll need it to identify our certifications.
hello, guest from the astral express. i am yukong from the luofu's sky-faring commission. welcome to the xianzhou.
don't worry about it, just follow me.
she told me that whenever she's feeling troubled, she finds a quiet corner in the artisanship commission and just sits there, letting the sounds wash over her.
in my fragmented dreams, i meet enemies on the battlefield but in my travels, i meet many people who i can describe with the word "teacher."
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
he has his own goals and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
you're just so blind.
one of the problems i want to solve is tackling the heating issue without exhausting geomarrow reserves. i've discussed this with serval -- she'll be the one responsible for handling this matter in future
this assertive aggression silvergun shura's words, before they were sealed, must have been just as fierce as yours.
unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "death."
...if we can start investigating on the way, that'd be good.
oh? i see this actor is creative with her words.
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful
miss topaz, i know you've done a lot of research into belobog. i was wondering if there was any information on the engine of creation in your records?
the transmutation arcanum seems to contain a secret that allows the vidyadhara to escape the cycle of reincarnation and return to normal reproduction but the mechanism eludes me.
thank you for your help, mister moze. we'll do our best to ensure your friend's safety.
a businessman from beyond the sky? and he's not on the whistling flames' records weird, why can't i remember him?
you astral express trailblazers have outstanding manners, though your allegories are a little odd
here we are. according to the judge, this area is not yet under control, so we should proceed cautiously.
unlike her, very few can realize that they are nothing but a tiny mustard seed in this vast galaxy she is worthy of my respect.
i haven't met anyone as interesting as you for a while. we should talk more when we get another chance!
yanqing told me that an ipc ship was attacked by borisin. is this what they were transporting on the ship?
sounds like a very hungry criminal came up with a very poor excuse
there's no way someone like him could've come up with the idea of disassembling a sculpture and hiding the pieces inside robots.
you can trust me. i know our paths have only crossed once before, but my intuition tells me you guys are good people. and i've got good intuition by the way, haha.
notification sent. i guess now we should go to the divination commission and see what's going on?
why not come around today and help me with my research? you'll be the subject, by the way.
in the future, a terrible catastrophe will arrive. if, under qlipoth the preservation's guidance, we fail to construct a barrier, that catastrophe will sweep away the stars, plunging all worlds into hell.
rest assured, we will come to skott's aid if needed. let's hope he's alright.
when bronya becomes the supreme guardian, do you reckon she'll let me perform at golden theater? i'll re-arrange that "supreme guardian" stage show and make it a rock 'n' roll musical!
didn't expect those pooches to actually recycle them all
it might also have been because clara was here -- the little girl in red. she's best pals with svarog -- always following behind him.
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? did something manage to sneak in?
believe it or not, galaxy ranger, acheron... those are the names i go by to this very day. my trip to penacony is solely to fulfill an old "final request".
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
haha, we'll see. i just hope the tingyun in your memories won't be tainted by phantylia anymore.
since the express crew helped the underworld through such a tough time, i need to do my best to help you in return.
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
this is svarog's turf. where to now?
i just met march and dan heng -- i'd heard about your adventures together but this is the first chance i got to meet them in the flesh.
as for you, you must be the guests from the astral express, right? saving the luofu from that crisis, it's so impressive.
you have a more important duty. cloud knights, attention!
so, is anyone going to tell me what's going on?
anything bothering you, miss firefly?
i must leave now. listen: don't worry. someone will come and find you very soon, just go with them. you won't remember a thing except me.
looks like we accomplished our mission. i need to get back to the guards and wildfire to wrap things up.
she's quite curious about you, as am i. what is it like to live in symbiosis with a stellaron? i hope we'll have sufficient time in the future to get to know each other and answer this question.
we caught them by surprise, nothing more. they'll be in pursuit soon enough.
i, bronya rand, the nineteenth guardian of belobog, hereby take my oath
that said, i can't make this call by myself. my companions need to know about this too.
mmm, rest well my apologies. there is still some work to be done and i can't see you out personally.
no, oleg didn't assign that to me. but i've got a pretty good idea who it's gonna be.
so this mister norbert could well be the museum thief we're looking for?
huh? don't you train?
i'm topaz! i've come to have a chat with mister svarog.
the verdant knights followed the route you mentioned and discovered the wreckage of the whistling flames ship. unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo.
they should have thought about whether they were capable of paying the price when seeking the power of an aeon.
it's pretty cute, but how can it make me better?
and now with firefly mentioning his name again it's hard not to be suspicious.
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
in order to quell the situation, chief oleg brought wildfire into the mine and left me in charge of security for the towns. but the situation in the mine is critical -- i have to back him up.
easier said than done do you know how?
when i heard the kids at the clinic talking about this "game," i thought they were just making things up again
the express is pretty empty, but there are traces of life everywhere. i can just imagine how bustling it would be with people here.
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
hmm you've given me some food for thought -- i should have a chat with the technology division about this.
moving containers, picking locks seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
until then, rest assured that i will do my best to fulfill my duty as your companion.
miss acheron here doesn't present a danger, and she's of no threat to the astral express. aventurine's prior accusation was based on nothing more than his own subjectivity.
oh, in layman's terms, it will simulate the aeons themselves. then we can ask them questions.
mm, true, but i'd probably only do a few decades, hehe.
now that the festival has come to a triumphant close, i'm curious -- what are the two of you planning on doing next?
the healer does not heal himself. don't try to act tough in front of me.
exactly, a rule of the silvermane guards. don't apply your rules to us.
(march's logic does seem to improve when it comes to minor details.)
jing yuan taught you how to slay abominations
the luofu's plaguemark is a tree, while the yaoqing's is a moon. ha, i think we got the better one.
we do? i hadn't realized. i've received rigorous military training -- coordinating with soldiers under any circumstances is easy for me
you are mistaken. dan heng told me nothing of the sort -- this was my own conjecture.
seven hundred-year-old newspaper clippings? that seems a little unlikely.
this swing is covered in dust hey, don't sit on it! it's filthy!
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
many of them were shaken by their experience when arlan found them, but they are otherwise fine.
he's actually explaining his joke!
have you heard of the three wonders of the underworld? geomarrow, heartless supervisors, and luka's fist of steel!
ignore him. strength is everything!
get to the point. what's your plan?
he went off on a new journey, and it's been quite a while since i last saw him.
i couldn't care less about what happened with the space station, but i will surely repay the favor tenfold to anyone who dares to taunt me.
miss bailu, as high elder of the luofu vidyadhara, please share your thoughts at this moment.
miss qingque, if you don't mind, may i take a look?
the astral express crew is in penacony, too?
enough! fine, i've done this before anyway! i apologize!
it was nothing. now that the matter with miss tingyun is resolved, are we meeting your other two companions next?
now that you're here, let's get started on the dock-related work.
some people are born with unparalleled foresight and exceptional intelligence but make the most ill-advised choices at destiny's crossroads.
this slope has a good view it'll be easy to watch the aurora.
according to his calculation results, the strength of the underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster.
as the raindrops tumble from the crimson leaves, their pitter-patter on my umbrella whispers gently to me. in these moments... i find brief serenity.
don't say that, serval. i know that you're still nursing a grievance against the supreme guardian, but this isn't a joking matter.
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
since you're leaving one way or the other, why don't you do the people of the city one last favor before you go?
oh! you mean that bonsai that even thrives in disharmony.
it's all happened so quickly i can only make conjecture. after leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. i hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
but because of our previous encounters fuel is being used up much faster than expected. we can probably only pull off two more warp jumps at most.
i took a "mutually assured destruction" button and repurposed it into a "sky full of sparkles" button i really wanted to give you an epic fireworks show!
but something happened to change that outcome?
i've checked the lines, there don't seem to be any major problems. all that's left is the energy hub.
vegetables mushrooms disgusting. why is it whenever there's an extinction, it's never these things?
step away from the intruders, serval. walk over slowly and stand behind me. you're different from them.
no matter how bad my mood is, high-quality protein is never to blame.
i'd like to hold this ceremony as a way of distancing the memory of tingyun from the lord ravager who tarnished her identity.
yes initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
i know, i know, you've got an important task ahead sorry to keep you. priorities are priorities.
i wonder if lady asta would like it? she drinks a cup or two occasionally, but she has it with milk and sugar. she can't stand bitter flavors...
the strength of the underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster those were her exact words. for me, that's our starting point.
darn, the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish causal relationships.
why are you so focused on all the wrong things?
therefore, given our connection to kafka, we represent the only way of luring the stellaron hunters in.
"miss serval" clara is such a well-mannered kid! meanwhile, the architects' children are still calling me "auntie" and making me feel old
when i run, time seems to flow especially slowly. being able to think at a leisurely pace is quite nice for someone with my impatience.
if possible, please inform the general and arrange for me to meet with the marshal. maybe this body of mine can help the alliance get one step closer to the xianzhou's enemies.
hm? still half asleep? don't force yourself. you should get some more rest.
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
i never thought our next meeting would take place under these circumstances. i believe the continuation of our last encounter will soon arrive.
you can always rely on mister svarog to come up with a brilliant idea! so, i guess we'll have to go find a new robot shell to fix it, right?
in that case, it's unanimous.
please don't worry, mister dan heng. if someone must be held accountable, it won't fall solely on your shoulders.
cloud knights! the borisin have arrogantly decided to challenge us on xianzhou territory! they vow that they will unleash a bloodbath along the streets of the xianzhou.
this "wardance" will not be seen by the people of the xianzhou, nor will it be just a ceremonial sword fight. this is a battle to the death that offers no honor, only mortal danger. march, are you ready?
lady bailu disappeared? that's nothing new -- she sneaks off all the time.
be there when she needs you, and listen to her when she feels vulnerable. she'll do the same for you.
take them out!? just hang tight for a second, i'm on my way. don't do anything stupid.
don't worry. just head back and talk things over with your companions.
please follow me. she should be around here somewhere.
misha is about to take us to her to find out what happened, but before that, let's meet up with himeko. you were with her earlier, right?
it's not the gods who answer us, but ourselves from the future.
i guess it's time to tell the story of that "mikhail."
then go. we'll stand guard.
what a coincidence! someone else who refuses to listen to the doctor's orders.
since you asked one of the three questions, it means everything is going smoothly. are you ready to hear my answer?
if you can't offer an explanation, i'm afraid these cloud knights will have to escort you out.
i've finished extracting that chip from the small robot. now all that's left to do is move all of this circuitry into the new shell
but this is different. we're worried about her running into strangers she might get herself into trouble.
mm looks like i still have a lot to learn
i've gathered a lot of info on aurum alley. want to take a look?
maybe that's why the trailblaze chose such a look.
it looks like they were walking side by side as opposed to one behind the other -- so the second individual is likely equal in status to aventurine.
an astounding recitation of the ninja mantra, master kucha! i swear i will train hard until i become the dazzling ninja!
then allow me! as a streamer, i've done my fair share of research. let me find my script
hey! silver wolf! look! it's screwllum, your good old opponent.
this building, this playground equipment i've seen it all before.
sampo who is sampo?
it's clear to me now. evidently, you are traveling in pursuit of the beauty's ideals.
you can stop gathering parts for the time being. just stay here and wait for us to return and give you your next orders, alright?
understood. i'll send my men to set up a perimeter and start the rescue operation right away.
uh, not the best time?
if you treat him as a child, he'll put on the airs of an adult. if you treat him as an adult, he'll show the temperament of a child.
mister sunday, even if the members of the oak family can't fully agree on what to do about the stellaron, now's not exactly the time to be holding an extensive discourse about penacony's past and future, is it?
i wouldn't be surprised if there are the silvermane guards have a lot to make amends for down here.
this is your first time experiencing the warp jump, so a little discomfort is unavoidable.
i'm fine, this pain is nothing, really. i'm used to it. in fact, i should be proud of it. it's a reminder of being able to protect everyone.
i've thought about it this responsibility rests on bronya's shoulders, not mine.
ah, the banal theatrics of stalling. let's not, shall we?
mingxi, please share with us what the guild has in mind.
the rain... is intensifying. before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions.
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
indeed. there is no information on the aether coin that could help us trace it back to its owner it seems returning it to its rightful owner will be quite the challenge.
a complete and utter loss -- incidentally, it seems to have resulted in your rather undignified arrival on the interrogation stand.
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
but it's dangerous around here. we'd better travel together.
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
if karma exists, then everyone has their own karma. you have yours, and i have mine.
there was a lunatic swordsmith who infused metal blades with heliobi, as he was obsessed with turning weapons into living things, and this is how cursed swords were made.
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
hello there! judging by your clothing, you two must be healers from the alchemy commission. my name is sushang -- i'm a cloud knight soldier. are you looking for the dragon lady who suddenly disappeared?
follow me, and i'll bring you to his parlor. hold your tongue and let me deal with the members of the family.
this is exactly why i didn't want yunli to know about this. i didn't want to create trouble, but trouble found its way here anyway. perhaps it really is divine intervention?
oh? now i'm curious to hear what master yunli has to say
hmph, well i'm gonna make sure i don't owe the guards any favors when this is done!
these are the remains of assassins who used cloudhymn magic to conceal their tracks. they aided in the borisin's escape, allowing them unimpeded passage through the shackling prison.
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
i'm not offended. but they did teach me that friends are weapons of the avgins. even under the watchful eye of the harmony, we need as many friends as we can get.
screwllum will stay on the space station for a while longer. he and herta still have problems they need to solve. as for me, i'm leaving soon and won't bother with goodbyes.
it's been a while. how have you been? i can't say i've been doing well lately myself, but that's normal for me.
companions i have not heard that word in a very long time. haha, how auspicious to be in the company of those on the same road.
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
that is why i must swear to fight to protect this warmth, rather than be protected by it.
i know that though every xianzhou ship operates individually, the cloud knights are all commanded by the marshal. therefore, it's normal for the knights to transfer between different ships.
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
where are you planning to go next?
those two notes. if someone finds them, they can be used as evidence against her.
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again and such a tragedy must never recur.
hmm, that might be a little tricky. i'm afraid miss natasha would probably have objections.
are you sure you're okay just giving it to eric like that?
don't call miss jade "big boss" in front of her, or there will be serious consequences. i mean, really serious.
oh, i haven't but please rest assured -- dreamflux reef is a small place, and it's not as bustling as the beautiful dream, but its safety is unmatched.
let me prescribe you something to soothe your body and mind -- take it before bed. it's best that you establish a regular work and sleep schedule.
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
before you ask a question, why don't you consider whether the answer has already been determined? it is better for everyone if such questions are not asked.
still, i suppose i should keep on helping everyone, i am the epitome of "joy, kindness, and goodness," after all.
yes, it's a possibility. that would explain why my memory of it is so blurry.
something's not right -- the xianzhou has lan the hunt's blessing. i struggle to believe that stellarons pose a threat in the eyes of the aeons
in the end, the dreams that people built in the name of freedom became the cage that imprisoned them.
"guide those who have lost their way back onto the right path." looks like this is an example of the "corrective measures" that the bloodhound mentioned. it's exactly what i would've done back then.
how perceptive. our wind, clouds, rain, and fog are all artificial. the realm-keeping commission's weather pavilion manages the environmental conditions here.
we have time. let's get into the detail tomorrow. it's late, and you must've been through a lot. go back to the town and rest. i'll make arrangements.
haha, i'm worried you don't trust her plan. just relax -- little gui is unbeatable in her area of expertise.
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
from a young age, my mother taught me to be forgiving and to preserve the goodwill in people's hearts even if i am but a small glimmer of light in this world, i must try my best to shine brightly for others.
because i can't bear to see idiots. of course, they wouldn't want to see me either.
even if you don't believe my outsider friends, you should believe me ugh, maybe i've wasted your trust in which case, believe bronya.
there you go, a small parting gift. if one day, you unfortunately fall into the deep waters of the memory zone and there's no memokeeper to join you -- hopefully it can guide you on my behalf.
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou
leave it to me. stick close guys, and don't get spotted.
thanks for the intel. we'll be careful.
he swore to follow idrila, the goddess, after being impressed by what he saw during our adventure.
hey, what are you trying to say!? name me someone above or below ground that walks the talk like sampo koski.
not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the penacony grand theater has now moved to the radiant feldspar -- the very airship you all stand upon.
how can such a drastic change have occurred in the course of one night?
she's kind and always willing to help. she invited me to "tea and storytelling" the next time i'm on the xianzhou. i'm not so sure about the storytelling -- sounds time-consuming.
hmph, the real competition is just getting started.
on behalf of the ten-lords commission, i commend you for your great service in resolving the divination commission crisis. i will honor all of you before the ten lords.
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
countless others would surpass him, soaring to even greater heights.
but aren't you--?
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them
we've been business partners for a long time.
you're not wrong, but be careful about blurting things out loud -- it could attract unwanted attention.
she clearly not a pathstrider of the hunt. but you are, aren't you? tell me, what's acheron's deal?
sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. he didn't say why. still, i'll wager it had something to do with him -- he's always tinkering with his devices.
i'm giving you my access card. give me your hand, and i'll input your fingerprint into it.
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side maybe even the same person.
alright, that's enough small talk. i've got things to do, seriously
but it was much earlier than that.
you mean yingxing? i've never met him in person, but grandpa has mentioned him countless times. he's probably one of his most famous apprentices i'd love to chat with that shard sword of his if i get the chance.
becoming a swordmaster in a mere fifteen days is quite challenging.
mister oleg has a pretty good handle on what's needed in the mine.
(a pawnshop that grants wishes is there really a place like that on this ship?)
also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. one piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
as long as we can gain access permissions to the hub, we can operate the gear bridge terminals.
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
just don't let me down now, okay?
no need to apologize -- feel free to read it. if you're interested in the incomplete ones you can take it.
i know, right? thanks to march seventh skipping class, we get to join in on the fun.
then, as the merlin's claw requests
this notice seems like a hint for us from miss sparkle.
but the secrets of the stellaron hunters cannot remain hidden any longer. i have no choice but to move beyond conventional protocol -- we must use divination to ascertain kafka's intent.
and it would seem the two of us can still coordinate our efforts.
ready to enter rivet town? we'll go in together when everyone is set.
stay focused. remember, we have to make him see that we're a variable in the calculation.
it woke up to discover that the whole place had been abandoned. so, it decided to collect parts, repair the town, and wait for everyone to return
my old friend, you once expressed your desire to be a long-life species. because we had a longer lifespan, you thought we would have more time to grow, rectify mistakes, and change the future.
true. but in the eyes of the denizens of abundance
knight of beauty, you're the one who stole guyun, right? hand it over! you have no idea how dangerous that cursed sword is.
she's actually a very reasonable old girl in private.
he has so many great swords that he never uses. sometimes, i can hear those swords crying is this what people mean when they say "spoiled for choice?"
why is that? is your constitution somehow different from the average person?
aiding the ten-lords commission in subduing the heliobi is a legitimate reason to take a leave of absence.
i understand thanks, master gongshu!
the testimony of dock worker a-feng, who has admitted to disrupting the normal operations of the dock in exchange for payment from the ipc.
look, help has just arrived.
it was a unique type of ice known as six-phased ice -- a substance that adheres to imaginary law, meaning that external forces cannot change its form.
but mister gopher wood once told me that all the order's efforts were aimed at avoiding the same mistakes that the harmony made.
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
...also, it never rains here! my outfit is too expensive to be exposed to the elements.
it's not been easy for you these past few days. you've earned some downtime. i'm looking forward to seeing how you'll perform on our next journey.
i'd be surprised if you didn't! don't underestimate the reputation of the nameless out among the stars -- you're following in the footsteps of the great akivili, after all!
well, this spot offers a great view. are you here to keep an eye on the skysplitter?
careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
the area to the north of belobog has been more or less swallowed up by the fragmentum. if you want to get to the northern snow plains, you'll need to get past the silvermane guard restricted zone on the front lines first.
hi, we meet again what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
got it. thanks for not holding back, svarog!
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
these guys are my assistants. we need to overhaul all the installations here.
huh, you do seem to travel light. but don't you at least need some pajamas!?
looks like you've forgotten -- there is a memokeeper girl in front of the express' shattered mirror.
to maintain their taste, the majority of commercial bananas are produced through "asexual reproduction." lacking seeds and pollen, they are grown from the same rhizome.
no need. i asked for you to come, so i won't send you away empty-handed.
yes this robot model probably doesn't have any kind of metal weapon.
"the water resembles a precious jewel, embedded in the dreams of all seafarers."
thanks, but i don't even know where to start
for example, if luocha took flight from the dock, how could he appear in cycrane footage two hours later?
but you don't need proof to have a suspicion, and for me suspicion is enough. i didn't need to find the memory zone meme. i just needed for someone to kill me like it killed the silver-haired girl.
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
i know, i understand. but please, let the ten-lords commission deal with this. we'll find a way to extract this heliobus from huohuo.
but you're talking about real evil.
well, for my sparkling companionship of course! i jest, i jest! the path has been blocked for over ten years, and very few know how to get through. that's where i come in.
to stand aside and observe is the best treatment one can give. there is a disease called "foolishness" that is harder to cure than any ailment.
health is everything -- you won't be much use if you neglect yours. let wildfire take care of the furnace core for now. you head back and recuperate.
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
don't make excuses for her.
do all you can to suppress them and fence them in!
that's simple. you see the robots over by the vagrants? they're all svarog's scouts -- every one of them is commanded to maintain order here.
i know i shouldn't have caused a scene at the sword-gifting ceremony, but i've thought this through. if i don't make a fuss now, that cursed sword will cause a whole lot more trouble. so, it's better if it's me causing the trouble.
...from that "galaxy ranger."
this light cone... is securely guarded. it must hold some important memories.
we need to start acting now if you want to survive. you -- come with me.
as for the spark i leave behind
curious about this blade? when unsheathed, it unveils the memories stored within -- every instance i've swung it, in the beginning, the end... and nothingness.
so? do you wish to confront him?
isn't it obvious? if we can catch one bailu, the other will come running to us!
sure am. things have been in constant turmoil since i transferred to the luofu. now that i've got a little free time, i'm here to listen to some storytelling.
she is indeed reckless, but she is also passionate and eager. don't underestimate her. youth can accomplish a lot simply by relying on such energy.
look at how bustling this ship is, not bad! someday when i'm less tied up, i plan to host a grand party on my eco-ship, and you'll all be on the guest list.
feel free to ask me about the interastral tournament festival and the venue. is there anything in particular you'd like to know?
normally, using devices like the shifting screen is strictly forbidden, as they could help prisoners escape.
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
even if i were to be revived, i would still lose. if not today, then tomorrow. no matter how strong i become, i would still eventually lose.
gotta have another slogan for this one.
people of belobog -- hear me!
did your memory module get damaged? maybe i can fix that too.
but given the urgency of the situation, let's just ignore the usual regulations.
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
wasn't affected by the fragmentum, right? you're not wrong. the fissure here only recently opened up. master oleg got the intel from our network just yesterday.
back then, i would ask him when i could go on adventures like him, and he would always laugh and say i was still too young.
we must seal the entrance before the borisin fugitives get out.
i regret missing out on your xianzhou journey, but everything that unfolded afterward, aside from the scheming, played out exactly as if i'd been there. this leads me to consider another possibility
ifrit of ever-flame mansion.
do you still remember those dreams you mentioned to us?
what you call "despicable," i call "efficient."
allow me to introduce myself. i'm lingsha, cauldron master and head of the alchemy commission on the luofu.
forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
