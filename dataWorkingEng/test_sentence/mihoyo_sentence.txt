take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss
however, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
what's wrong? if it's too much trouble, please, there's no need to force it.
they periodically throw out a lot of unclaimed or abandoned goods. we might find something that we can exchange for mora.
"i was suddenly seized with an urge to write a letter after finishing this bottle. i just folded it up and left it in the bottle, though. if i end up forgetting about it, it won't really matter."
quick, back to the energy supply hub. anyone that tries to stop us is gonna find out a thing or two.
you should go back soon, lady bailu. those two medics have had a rough day.
let's try something else. as long as we're in liyue harbor, this kind of misunderstanding is inevitable.
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
i'm just an eccentric old hag to them. that story's been passed down so long, it might as well be true.
following grandpa's plan, our disciple march is taking your place as ringmaster aren't you proud of her?
yes, welcome back, kaeya. why is the honorary knight accompanying you?
who knows? she tends to make decisions based on the results of her divinations as opposed to what others might be thinking.
haha, i said i was going to resign from being her bodyguard, not that our friendship was over. we're still the best of friends.
should we need to place such an order, we would certainly go to second life instead.
they not only helped avin find her best friend, but they also showed us what an urstone is.
unwinding in a bath sounds appealing now would you care to join me?
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection why would they come after me?
such is life, full of surprises. that's why you gotta seize any opportunity to take a break -- who knows when trouble will come knocking at your door.
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "the stone heart of a ninja is immune to pressure, immune to lies, come wind, rain, or shine."
the blizzards here are brutal. if we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, belobog would long since have become a dead city -- both above and below the surface.
traveler! ah aeur" excuse me. i should address you as honorary knight under the circumstances.
do not underestimate the enemy. hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. the advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
however, even though svarog is no longer sealing off the furnace core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
okay, you won. go on, you can put on that smug face now.
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
why do you insist on becoming a pilot!? i don't understand.
but i do have one more question for you, monsieur.
it wasn't as fun as you think.
huh? can't we just bring some desserts? like the fontinalia mousse?
after weighing things up in my head, it made the most sense for only me to stay put.
now, from the gold, blue, and rainbow decks of cards, please pick the deck that fits you best.
hm it's a place too cold to bear, covered in snow and ice. the guys doing the scientific research don't have time to worry about the surroundings.
greetings. i'm acheron.
oh, before i forget navia, the short sword you had with you earlier
the aim is to try not to get hit by the attacks. since you've escaped certain death at her hand once already, i presume this shouldn't be more than you can handle?
both of you may continue to stay in okhema, and its citizens will continue to view you as distinguished guests. however, you must promise that today's farce will not occur again.
you're the best. the other guests haven't even replied yet
are you serious? that's big news. how come i never heard about it?
stealing is always wrong, and pascal needs to learn that.
heh, well, i was the biggest star in all of fontaine, after all. it takes more than just a pretty face to earn a reputation like that. i know how to get serious when the situation calls for it.
yes, and no.
mhm, although i do have a small regret.
to put it simply, makoto wasn't concerned about outcomes.
relax, she's the strongest girl i've ever seen.
they often gossip about the latest issues of serialized novels, or the gossip on who has a crush on whom
miss acheron, i have a suggestion: why not split up and look for a way out, and meet up again when we find something? that would speed things up.
my name is tingyun. i'm the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. may i venture to know the illustrious names of my heroes?
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
i'm very upset he didn't obey my orders and insisted on searching the storage zone even though everyone had already evacuated.
we are done here, yes? i am free to go, am i not?
naturally, since you are the face of that historic event. i intend to make chess pieces for everyone who was involved that day, including myself.
based on what you said, even if i should wake up, these wounds that caused my death will remain on my body and never heal?
looks like she also sent you a message
so long, my friends. may the preservation bless your journey.
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
remember, it's often the unassuming pawns -- the lone traveler or the worm that subdues the dragon -- that leave even the best strategists helpless.
of course, what makes this even crueler is that you managed to convince yourself there was "no other way." uncle tian was always going to give you this opportunity even if you'd done nothing at all.
i wish to borrow a tea set from the yashiro commission.
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents
cocolia it's been so many years since we last spoke. we were great friends once -- there was nothing we wouldn't share.
well, when i think about my time here, i've spent most of it behind a desk, filing documents.
the victims obviously will have gotten quite a fright, but at least they won't be in any great danger.
what's up, nervous?
stop! all of you! put down your weapons!
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
that's right. i'm surprised you understand it so well
our top priority is to find albedo and razor. do you know which direction they went?
thanks for your invitation, but i am the silvermane guards' intelligence officer -- i can't just drop my work and go travelling
haha. interesting. yes, we have a special relationship, but i don't see anything unusual about it.
he asks this question aeur" "would natlan have been saved if the ceremony succeeded?"
cirrus, we've come to ask you a few questions. i hope you'll be cooperative.
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
i'm miss dunyarzad's bodyguard, here to see that she returns home safe and sound.
you and your comrades will all be welcome to join aeur" but be warned, the training will be grueling. perseverance and grit will be in high demand.
all that you have experienced during your travels is sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
if you ask me, after she lost tail, i think her urge to resign became even more apparent.
liyue harbor is very inclusive. as long as you respect the rules here, you will not be turned away.
actually, seeing as there's no one around can i ask you some things?
have you ever heard of cursed swords? that sword is one.
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
i'd be surprised to find someone with the exact same first and last name. shahzaman homayani is dunyarzad's father, and the head of the homayani family.
oh, really? but i never guess wrong.
ah, that reminds me. i believe what she actually said was, "so help me, i will figure out what i should do about this script."
forget it, it's all in the past now. i shouldn't get myself down, i must look ahead to my new life.
you aren't hiding anything, are you?
yes, you can breathe easy now, phantom weasel.
you're definitely a unique individual, just like huaiyan said.
"be eager to help those in need and do one good deed a day" i like to practice what i preach, but i never thought we'd accomplish so much.
or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what i wanted to do.
"mecha" what an intriguing statement. i recall the bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal -- "a tall male in silver armor."
y'know, i never guessed you'd become a pro at this job -- i only wanted you to experience the fun of working here
makoto saw a bigger picture than i did. in her view, a "dream" is more imaginary, more abstract than an "ambition."
recovering, slowly but surely i should be raring to go before too long.
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
why don't i just get this one called "kumquat curls"! curly orange hair, it's perfect for taking pictures and shopping!
fireworks are more visible at night if possible, i suggest you wait till after dark to put your plan into action.
oh, and don't forget to return the pass permit to me after you have finished with it.
as the marshal's special envoy, i'll dispatch the luofu cloud knights to pursue hoolay myself.
yes. exactly. very to the point.
only a very few people in belobog know of the existence of the stellaron. those that do would never associate it with the fragmentum or eternal freeze.
i didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
yes, that's right! i'm very sorry, everyone. i will take my leave!
but, it doesn't last. with the passing of the seasons, everything withers away. you can try to water it, but it will never bloom again.
perhaps not. but you should be.
mm, make sure you've got everything you need.
hehe, at ease, soldier! for the time being, at least, we are in peace time.
wonderful. then i'll be counting on you to provide my schedule for tomorrow.
then again, i suppose your frankness is part of your charm.
good, i'm glad i could be of some help.
thanks to her, i learned how to navigate the forest by the age of six, and could hunt monsters in the wild by myself the year after that.
welcome, dear guests from the express. judge hanya of the interrogation division, we've met before.
there is nothing to feel distressed about, because nothing, i repeat, nothing, happened here in these woods today. did it?
ah i also have a few new things to teach you. alright, follow me.
then, your parents told me what happened between you when you were younger. once i'd heard the story, i realized that the firework meant something special to you both.
what can i say? i don't trust it either. for some reason, whenever someone tells me they're gonna do something interesting, i end up imagining a pile of trash
the culprit of this crime exploited that very fear to get access to this house without having to force their way in.
you really want to hear it that bad, huh?
but i am capable of discerning right from wrong, and i deeply understand what "freedom" means to the people of mondstadt.
perkins is protecting me. i'll be alright. i'm going to leave after i gather up these painkillers.
i just scouted out all of wolvendom but i did not see you.
this is an opportunity for you to show remorse.
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left
my first ever toy was a short sword. although, i suppose it wasn't so much a toy as something master removed from her waist and handed to a noisy child in need of distraction.
after the brilliant performance you put on, the reputation of your troupe is sure to spread through fontaine like wildfire. you won't have to disband if you don't want to.
then we'll build a no, we'll build a whole lot of them -- trains that look just like the astral express.
we have already considered every possible way of resolving our differences, but it seems the descendants of the aristocracy remain antagonistic towards the knights
but one by one, all the obstacles are being removed. now is the time to rally the troops.
don't worry. now that you're at the alchemy commission, i'll do my best to find a solution.
"to dehya" it's a letter for me?
see? even the oratrice has decided to show me its favor. are you sure you want to commit to a charge that will never be upheld?
now then, given that your training is complete, it's time we return to mondstadt. our last step will be preparing a cordial gift to present to my uncle when you meet him.
oh, look! the door opened! you guys really aced that first puzzle!
we don't have any convenient pills like that, but if you just need a temporary boost for the duel, we might be able to figure something out.
i received my vision when i debuted on stage. if even the goddess was willing to watch my performance, then that must mean she had acknowledged the beauty of human-made art.
regardless of why it's designed like the conductor aboard the astral express, this doll -- is it connected to the case?
ah, i wouldn't go that far it's just that mister afshin is really good at spinning stories. a word from him, and you'll find yourself buying things you don't actually need.
mm that is indeed a problem.
but i still want to try. i'm reluctant to just let zubayr theater go.
breaking the covenant of our alliance will bring war upon the vidyadhara. even if we are able to have offspring again, what difference will it make?
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
in sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
uh this morning? yeah, that's right. he's on urban patrol duty today, right? that's why he popped round and asked the favor.
the xianzhou need brawny warriors with their swords and spears, as well as unpredictable waters like her who travels freely and unrestrained.
according to some of the older eremites, it does actually rain in the desert on occasion. and when it does, it's always a lot heavier than this.
none of these meka have serial numbers, i was sure to check a moment ago. they are not the ones used by the authorities to enforce the law.
we shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. let's go check out the wharf where he usually goes fishing.
it's an ore -- a special energy resource. whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on geomarrow.
i'm sorry, my dear. my dream dance partner i've already got sights on someone else.
however, not all eremite brigades are like mine. some are willing to cross all kinds of lines for the sake of mora. the most notorious is a faction known as "deshret's relics."
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully
memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
there's an old saying in liyue: "a bed that faces the door shall be haunted by a ghost of horror."
shh, follow me. keep quiet and tread lightly
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
i hate to admit it, but the "harmony" in this place resonates more broadly than within the sweet dream
in the end, only seven victors remained standing in teyvat. they built cities and nations on the corpses of the vanquished, and thus began the era of the seven.
i really wish he had a little more self-confidence.
vowing to protect the underworlders in one breath, and then deciding they deserved to be abandoned in the next "family code of conduct" -- what a joke.
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces let's hurry back.
in pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe, huh? in that sense, you astral expressers and i are cut from the same cloth.
my informants often provide me with extremely important information. it's only fair that i endeavor to meet any requests they have in return.
the odds of that are very slim. it's practically impossible. i've checked aeur" all the paper's been burned. there's only ash left now.
she showed genuine concern for me when we first brought up the topic. i can't repay her kindness with doubt and suspicion.
the world of commerce is a battleground, and policy-making requires conviction and decisiveness.
of course. i--i'm sure there's a story behind it, but that's between you and mother -- i won't pry.
hmm, alright. it seems that your crew really can't go on without my care and direction.
if i win, we might be able to overturn things and change their minds.
drifting memory fragments
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something and that'd just be too sad.
memory is like the deep blue sea. but if you try to catch two fish with one cast you might not be satisfied with your catch.
are you guys ready? i'm going to play it.
he must have encountered some kind of danger and his sword flew away to find someone to help, right?
so, what did she seem like to you?
but first, we should head to jueyun karst. if you'll excuse us, madame ping, we'll be leaving now.
probably around three? give or take.
what a coincidence! someone else who refuses to listen to the doctor's orders.
you have to be more specific, captain beidou.
hm would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? who knows, maybe i'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
that's enough chatter. get to work!
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
roping you in was possibly the most masterful move we could have made. i believe that future generations will say so too, when our deeds come up for their review.
considering you two, i think you should have no problem making it to the end.
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express, just to listen to music?
one rule though -- please don't ask anything boring
anyway, it's getting late. i should escort miss dunyarzad to nilou's stage. see ya later.
mhm. there's a special note for the gm at the end of this section that says to proceed to an indoor set for the next part of the script.
and of course you would believe everything he reported. the only thing you know about me is that i'm a mercenary, but you've never seen me in action.
thank you, everyone. i feel a lot less nervous with your support!
let's write about inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? i can help with this one. we can use the vision hunt decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
nice, it's sweet. the sensation is not so different from eating a dessert. a unique beverage indeed.
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
by the way, where is your general? didn't you say he would be joining you?
so the truth is clear now, right?
i have a gut feeling that sooner or later we'll connect all the dots and then, we'll finally know the truth.
i see. please extend my regards to the ten lords
ah, should we get ready then? perhaps we should wear something a little more appropriate
hence, we must be prepared. when our task is to craft the armor for the deliverer, what harm is there if you and i don humble attire?
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
i especially love velvet coats, they're so fragile and beautiful. difficult to maintain -- you only have to be a tiny bit careless to ruin the sheen.
lisa, we need to establish some ground rules if we do end up apprehending any drunken troublemakers, no electrocutions. okay?
you have already witnessed my previous views on eternity.
i meant my lifetime.
so the one in this photo are you sure it isn't me?
everyone seems so devoted to the troupe. i'm sure if you keep chipping away, you'll find a way through.
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
good evening. have you had dinner? what did you have, how was it? oh just making conversation. don't think anything of it.
wooow, how dazzling!
okay, here we go eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
oh? so, you do know what kind of place this is
that's because the great mujina youkai is extra powerful! and that's exactly why i need your help, isn't it?
but shrewdness is easily perceived as cynicism in the eyes of others. people come to think of you as someone who cares only about money, and not people.
as for now, i'm temporarily suspending the activities of the ghost-hunting squad.
you can't work your way out of writer's block! a short break is a good way of refreshing the mind.
huh? sounds like maternity leave knocked the wind out of your sails! feeling rusty?
after making some inquiries, i found them to be most uncooperative. so i had to resort to this auction to finally put a stop to all this nonsense.
once again, thank you for being kind to me. i wish you a great time in the dream, and i shall not interrupt your... date?
you'll be able to try all the finest food for free. how does that sound?
you know the chief? then why don't i know you
i'd love to know where you picked this thing up.
oh? then what kinds of birds do you have in sumeru?
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
has your time in okhema been enjoyable? if you have any wishes, please let this "garmentmaker" know. the holy city will certainly offer the most splendid hospitality for its allies.
farewell, bartholos. be sure to get my message to cipher.
i was originally thinking of going with him, but he said he could manage it himself. he told me to go see the sights around fontaine and to enjoy the local culture.
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
although i met guizhong a few times, i never knew anything of this particular story
at the same time, the blessing of remembrance will fall upon everyone. please look forward to this surprise.
klee, did you go off by yourself without authorization again?
thunder is kinda scary. are you afraid of it? if so, i can share a nifty method to help with that.
perfect, thanks for that. be sure to pass my regards to everyone else in the brigade as well.
don't worry. price shouldn't be an issue. i'm sure we can work something out. but i'm just a little hazy on one thing aeur" did zhiyi's wineware set include wine glasses, or?
with everyone's help, you successfully excavate the wooden chest from the ground.
that'll give them the chance to take a lot of liberties they can copy any secret texts or steal any treasure they find underground.
ah, you've finally arrived. there's no time to spare, so we'll begin with our first lesson
the master control zone where we are now is the control center of the whole space station.
is the smell of "death" so enticing, my fine fellow?
and for good reason, no? a bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
oh, that's a letter i was gonna send to my mom. i haven't even finished writing it.
his method was a wish of sorts to begin with aeur" to join the past and future together and combine their beauty.
ignore him. strength is everything!
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey
once we reach the gate, i hope you'll help me seal it. after that, i'll do everything i can to fight the borisin, and you find a safe place to hide and wait for reinforcements.
suddenly, you hear footsteps outside the door.
after a long, difficult journey, you finally arrive at the location indicated by your map. it appears to be an ancient site of some sort, where treasure likely awaits.
yes, had he drunk the poisonous wine, he still would've faced serious health consequences despite taking the antidote. he didn't hesitate to put himself in harm's way to achieve his goal.
finally, if you still think you can copy the fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment
then i'll look forward to seeing your performance.
xiaohan, whenever you are ready. tell us about your plan for aurum alley.
i can't bear to think how painful and lonely her final days must have been
yep, touch it and find out -- ice cold. i was just about to fix it up.
when you've worked in intelligence for a long time, you'll understand that no one can stay on high alert forever. especially when he thinks he's about to win.
the rain... is intensifying. before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions.
you are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity
in the past, poets from liyue used kites to symbolize a feeling of longing or evoke the peacefulness of idyllic rural scenery.
that sounds fantastic. i've got a couple of other things to attend to right now, though, so why don't i come back some other time, and we can chat over a drink?
you did quite admirably. i could see your determination and your hard work.
i need to borrow a ceremonial sword, and make some other preparations. it'll take me about two days.
this is a world dominated by titans. and that order can only be toppled by the chrysos heirs.
yeah, they do, and it's a reaaaaaally big one! you're the conductor of your group, aren't you? you remind me of mister zubayr!
of course, you'll still need to take the keys and pay a personal visit to the two hunters you wronged. prepare to accept any terms they give you as well.
still, we hung out every day, it's only natural that my love for inventing would rub off on her.
sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. but try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
it was my mistake to make an unwarranted request without considering your own wishes.
hehe, there's really no need -- i've spent my years traveling the universe! not to mention, i'm younger and stronger than i look.
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
barbara said that it's so rare for us to get a chance to come to an island, we should change into summer clothing to set the atmosphere.
hmm want to make some flower pots?
with their stronghold exposed, i doubt the balladeer is stubborn enough to try and retaliate now on his colleagues' behalf. it would be more trouble than it's worth.
i heard you got caught by the family? i gave you a clear clue "befriend a mute." simple and straightforward, you know?
haha, he's my little brother, of course i don't want to leave him alone. but i don't have any other choice.
well, either we reason with them or charge straight through the blockade let's play it by ear!
no problem, but remember that a debate is like a duel. the more you hesitate, the farther you are from victory.
a patient's medicine doesn't just reveal their illness. it also offers a window into their desires and needs.
perhaps i put too much on your plate at once
dear audience, the performance is experiencing a technical difficulty, but worry not! the guards shall resolve it soon enough!
in the meantime, she'll have to learn to withstand the darkness -- just as i have.
people would think i've lost grip on the gravity of the situation. that's why i can only do this in private.
the aftermath of stormterror's last attack is finally settled for the moment.
yes, but only for a week. by the end of that week, i defeated it in combat, and we've shared a cordial relationship ever since.
there. that's the audience system's terminal. come, walk with me. we'll check what's wrong with it.
now place your left hand onto the bench. lift your arm up with your palm facing forward, and part your fingers slightly
that's all of them. please wrap them up for me.
so, you've reached an agreement? alright then, we can continue with the story.
thank you. enjoy your time here too.
i sense it too. something seems to have changed, but i can't confirm for sure it could be difficult to verify.
the only difference between us is whether we embrace or reject the long life placed upon us by the abundance.
and so it falls to me to place the truth before your eyes, in all its ugliness.
let's keep moving. watch out for monsters.
the rations we brought were adapted from my signature moon pies. to come up with something even tastier i gotta hand it to you, you did a great job!
please never do that again
hey, that's pretty good! i'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
simple. it wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? so we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
take your time, pick some good ones. i'll be right here.
that's not the only thing you won't have heard of down here, princess.
if you don't agree, i'll have no choice but to report everything back to "father." simple as that.
as for how much my insight is worth in terms of mora, everyone has their own idea. there is no standardized way to measure something like this.
paimon's right. we should take advantage of the clear weather to reassess our situation.
and with that, our second round is done. cyno, layla, and kaveh are our victorious contestants!
he went missing recently, and after searching his home, we found evidence that led us here. he appears to believe that somewhere in sumeru lies the key to restoring our clan to its former glory.
a gift from belobog's number one rock star -- you're not allowed to dislike it! or at least don't tell me if that's the case
that sounds like her, all right. i bet she forgot which of the two she'd used by the time she got back each night.
ningguang is good to work with. but i have to be mindful of our identities when i'm out in public. when i meet a qixing as an employee of the ministry of civil affairs, they're "sir" or "lady" to me.
they brought this upon themselves. the xianzhou alliance forbids anyone from accessing forbidden knowledge regarding immortality.
it can get uncomfortable, i guess but what else would i be using my voice for?
...a fitting metaphor for the nameless' trailblazing spirit.
great. so, mister dvorak and i will concentrate on things here in the city to make sure the concert goes according to plan. in the meantime, ganyu will reach out to her network and try to find the person he's looking for.
so the key is whether or not you yourself can develop a sense of belonging in liyue harbor.
a meticulously thought out and interesting suggestion. it'll make for a novel gift. let's go with that.
sure is, i've already started placing bets.
hm, let me guess fortunately, the next person you ran into was the director.
i quote: "sixty miles to the northwest is the guili assembly. many were settled there, where they hunted in groups, farmed the land, and made their living from what the soil yielded."
what happens next is going to blow your mind
ganyu has brought me up to speed on everything. i'll get straight to the point.
hmm, yes. this is a change in the person himself.
thank you for the concern, but i'm fine~ the general commanded me to stay with you -- i dare not go against military orders.
ninja hero? huh, it seems that my trial has finally come to an end
how's the journey been? if there's something weighing you down, let me do a little divination for you
just this simple chat with you has made me feel a lot better
avoid entering someone's past memories lightly, especially hers.
hey, you're pretty quiet. what's your name? i've got forms to fill out -- can't put your name down as blank.
if my stage were anything like that i'd be thrilled if i had just two real padisarahs on the stage.
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
you seem to know a lot, miss chevreuse. i assume you use these types of firearms on a regular basis?
your question was written all over your face. now look, you've helped me rebuild the jade chamber, and i intend to repay you handsomely for it.
maybe the fading disorder occurs when the ink within the body dries up that would explain why the beings here are forgetting their own stories
after wandering around a bit, we finally bought a few dozen boxes of the zhuming's special salty-sweet pastries and ended up munching on them for several months.
no need to stay on our account. we just got up here, so we're going to stay around for a little longer.
by neither saying goodbye nor seeing me again, our relationship will remain forever how it was in her mind, at least.
that's a good idea. it might be commonplace, but it's still the specialty of penacony. it would make for an ideal gift to bring home.
i'm alright, don't worry! everything worked out eventually. let's wait for the rest of them to get back
of course i do, i've understood them for a while now. but as far as i can tell, she doesn't need other people's understanding. she needs to understand her own heart.
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
so that's what happened, mister svarog. but there's one thing i don't understand why is pascal being treated as a fragmentum creature?
how about it? can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
now, please excuse me, i have other business that demands my attention. i wish you a fun-filled festival.
did destiny's slave make you do it?
i always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food hmm? you'd like to see me do that? hah! i'm sure you would.
the data bank is very interesting. i love the entry for the mourning actors -- it's so vivid and full of details.
even though my apprentice has learned a thing or two, as a master, i can't stop worrying!
no. as you just pointed out, that kind of thing is easily replaced.
at least, that's my theory. still, that doesn't explain why pascal is being treated as a fragmentum creature
so it's made up? what's the point of that? without being grounded in reality, how can the story be believable?
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living fulfilled lives.
my family set only the highest expectations for me, even as a child.
yeah, but have you heard the tale of the first sage? to prevent a calamity, he went on a journey to find the dendro archon.
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
uh, speaking of which, why haven't i seen a single village keeper since i got here?
why? it's not like i'm here to cause trouble. let's just relax.
garmentmaker, can you give me the intel the nymphs have gathered?
master yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. i don't think you have very good taste.
and there he goes again i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
since i'm a genuine knight of favonius, i fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. look, i may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but i'm not a total degenerate!
that's easy. i'll just write a "do not disturb" on the mask and avoid interacting with people, right?
don't be melodramatic. working even a single brain cell of mine to take out foes like her is an outright waste of my smarts.
i can't speak for everyone, but this is how i really feel.
maintain my weapons, check my next job, sneak in a quick nap.
i guess it shouldn't be a problem. after all, he did get nerfed after turning into a good guy.
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said if you need something from us, just say the word.
it's arlan's shoe size alright -- and this actually came from a pair of shoes i bought for him.
clara said she was going to find components, right? let's start with nat's storage room.
and you, my dear benefactors, will be my source of courage.
power duly assimilated. ready to receive instruction.
remember, train hard and relish every moment! the title awaits you!
should i take this to mean that you doubt the relative safety of leaving this in the hands of the tianquan?
you willingly took this work on, knowing that it would be tedious, and you have worked diligently. my secretaries and i are very grateful to you.
if it's her, she will earn the respect and assent of all the vidyadhara on the luofu.
(oh no judging by the atmosphere, clorinde and navia are probably thinking something similar. the mood just got super awkward all of a sudden)
is it just me, or has he accepted the goddess's prophecy?
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards we didn't meet seele until way later.
thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
my situation is completely different. i'm here because i was asked to accompany you. the tea purchase is simply an added bonus of this location.
morning. you look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? what mischief were you up to last night, hmm?
this shell hmm it doesn't appear to be the same design as this little fella's
when i asked for your names, i couldn't help but think that this "first encounter" was actually a "long-awaited reunion" for you.
it's the same old place. everywhere you look, there are robots that have lost the ability to function
darn, how could they all be empty? now even the monsters are gathering supplies?
not that i'm doubting your skill, but i'd feel terrible if you hurt yourself in the process.
first, we have lady fu xuan of the divination commission. what do you think best suits her?
i know. if we were just a little quicker, we could have stripped away its power
have you talked with these disciples, benefactor? what do you make of them?
that you have piqued her interest. perhaps it's because she has never seen an individual who is so unpredictable in the face of eternity.
i--i've never seen a robot with this kind of malfunction before what happened to it?
but you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
so think hard about what that means. and then think again about what you hope to achieve by arguing with each other.
the water in siltwater lakes does originate from groundwater, but it's too bitter to be used for drinking.
the hatred in one's heart might dissipate one day, but the way of the ninja within their hearts will never be forgotten ever.
gotta have another slogan for this one.
you don't look so tough yourself. well, let's find her. svarog's not going anywhere.
focus on my voice, qiqi. you are not feeling sleepy. you are the most awake person in the whole world. even if everyone else falls asleep, you are going to stay wide awake.
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
if there were scales, with all the people of fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
i'm all for work-life balance, but i think this is pushing it.
i've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
we won't cause a serious diplomatic crisis by getting into some small scuffle with the fatui within our borders. you need not worry.
teacher, show him the way forward.
drinking in liyue harbor, huh? some cover story. i'll wager they've been going to intelligence updates
great, let's head back and fix the cart.
don't mind me. just do whatever you like.
well, what are you waiting for, little one?
alright, alright. i'll go, but robin, i suggest you seriously consider this
um, won't we stick out if we go in like this?
i doubt i know much more than you, but i believe that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances is very powerful.
let's go find my lady again. we'll tell her everything, and see if she's willing to lend us her support.
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns?
miss hanya, tell me straight does the ten-lords commission actually have a solution?
and all the while, people would be getting sick, losing their homes, and fighting just like in the mine.
the first item is the maritime administration issue. during wartime, we restricted fishing rights for watatsumi vessels in narukami waters
i thought you wanted to get some sleep? so maybe you should stay here and rest.
state your query. to the point.
i, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
oh no, not yet! there's more mora to be made.
inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. hmph.
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
that's not usually like him. i wonder what's going on?
oh, you mean the special patrol's musketeers?
you know mingxi better than i do. would she deceive you with fake data?
in fact, we were only just tipped off. we're still working on the logistics of the arrest operation hmm? who's this
i heard it, too! our ears aren't messing with us. there was definitely a beep, but it sounded like it was coming from inside my head!
it is said that he is difficult to get along with due to his temperamental disposition, but if we approach him calmly, then things should go off without a hitch.
um no, there's one more thing we still need to find out why pascal was stealing parts in the first place.
good night. garner your strength for the battles ahead.
bravo, good show! you certainly live up to your reputation.
as you approach the battlefield, you see numerous people lying by the side of the road. they appear to be dressed like guards.
your master yanqing wasn't as lucky. he's probably still in bed
compared to the skies and the stars, our lives are as brief as fleeting insects how i wish i can witness the day that the xianzhou truly returns in triumph.
and my phone definitely doesn't have enough storage so, memorizing it is the most convenient way to go.
haha, that won't be necessary -- i can't imagine march reacting well if her camera went missing. besides
i'm sure she knows it better than i do.
but if the tenryou commission does catch up to you, then make a run for the boat.
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
that's good to hear. otherwise, given that i am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
she has a long-standing conflict with her father. that's why she ran away from home.
if he can conquer his fear and return as a demigod, we will be one step closer to the miracle that the prophecy promised.
finding the source of the corruption can wait. these puppets no longer have use now that i'm here. take them all out! defective goods ought to be sent back to the repair center!
hold on, i said "we," didn't i? no need to say goodbye, because you're coming too.
i am yunli. come, take up your sword. we'll get to know each other once we've sparred.
dunn, this concerns the fate of belobog -- no -- the fate of our whole world. please don't stand in our way
good roll alright, maybe i'll take one more day off, and knock out the rest of the work once i'm feeling up to it.
truthfully, i've never heard of this stellaron.
okay. well, see you soon, then.
a classic tale of youth and friendship. it never gets old.
go to a corroded town to collect some useful resources? i'm in.
i just thought that nothing good could come out of telling you about the messy happenings of mercenaries. knowing too much only leads to more trouble.
don't worry about it, mister stream. it'll all be worth it when the tavern reopens and we finally have the chance to hear your marvelous singing voice.
you made it sound like you were talking to those kids but you were talking to me.
with the help of the guard, you successfully escape the dungeons. your sense of despair and anxiety both seem to fade as you continue your quest.
feels like we're not getting many friendly looks, huh.
it's hard to find the music you want on the streaming platforms managed by the ipc. i, for one, had to subscribe to at least a dozen of them.
if you get hit by the musou no hitotachi, that's it. it's game over. i would get training if i were you.
hehe let's keep moving towards master lu's warehouse. our goal is to get the invoice, after all.
report the losses to general jing yuan and find someone from the divination commission. they can't just stand there watching while we deal with this mess
peace soon returned to the capital. those in the court manipulated by the sorcerer also recognized the errors of their ways
it took enough time to calm her nerves, it's best i don't disturb her again now.
...wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. your gamble... is not over yet.
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
greetings, mister jut! do you still have any food that's ready-to-go?
well, can't say we didn't try.
why, this is the most exciting sub-plot of the novel: the secret investigation. i'm sure you must be curious about where the magical powers of the wisdom orb and floral jelly really come from?
besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
do you see that mechanical gear bridge? when you cross over to the other side, you arrive at hell on earth.
guinaifen, an outworlder, unemployed you entered fyxestroll garden with sushang, a cloud knight, the day before yesterday.
phew i still get nervous at times like this. it's just like when you step on stage, and you can tell that every single person's gaze is fixed right on you.
i should thank you for saving my life. your sword skills were impressive, taking down that big guy.
wrong. none of it would have been possible without winning the hearts of local businesses.
mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. and, after he left, it became three.
i suppose it's fair to say, then, that this final show, besides being your farewell to the stage, is also your final gift for her?
but now that i look closer, it seems like the lanterns are floating in midair. how is that possible?
her body may have perished, but she became the sacred sakura. this, too, is a form of eternity.
i'm just an alchemist -- i don't understand them in any detail. i only know that they are a group of xianzhou people who view themselves as denizens of abundance.
aside from the delivery of performances, isn't this another reason for zubayr theater's continued existence?
only innocent children and timid adults are scared of thunder. but you're not either of those are you?
is there someone here in rivet town doing this? or could pascal have collected the pages and put them together?
oh, don't say that. besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
after a strange encounter, i was fragmented into multiple "tingyuns," each embodying a different aspect of my memories.
perhaps this does not result in what you might call a fair price. but what it does do is identify the person who values the item the most.
i'd like to repay you when i'm done with the work at hand. what would you say if i accompanied you on one of your trips?
no, no, of course not! are you lesser lord kusanali?
alright, i won't tease the two of you any further.
i heard about the holy lyre, but i never suspected it was you.
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
someone hasn't been paying attention.
also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. one piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
i would say you've already suffered more than enough.
if only i had talked to you from the beginning, grandpa maybe things wouldn't have escalated like this.
this trial was prepared by cloud retainer. its goal is to help me feel like an adeptus again.
i want to see the stellaron. i want to see the place where cocolia sacrificed herself.
i might not know all the stories and legends, but i know a legendary sword when i see one.
let me remind everyone that we are at a hearing. mister president, please share with us your vision for aurum alley.
"the fox you gave me is very beautiful, miss shrine maiden, but i still love my old friend the most."
more likely a natural occurrence. our weapons have had no effect on it.
living in a world like that would be a dream come true!
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
let me take a look. this puppet should be #twenty-seven fifty-seven.
(oh? they appear to be feeling quite confident. looks like our work will go smoothly.)
i should inform you that we took out a fatui camp recently. i suspect that before long, they will attempt to reestablish contact with your people in the hope of procuring some assistance.
suddenly you hear the sound of footsteps pierce through the darkness.
as lyney once said a performer's job is to commit fully to their role, and put on a flawless performance for their audience.
i hereby ask all parties to submit your support documents for evaluation. the documents should include scope of business, ratio of contributions, and registered capital.
although these three items are rare, i trust that with your connections and capabilities, procuring them will not be a question of "if," but of "when."
then, you should understand. nearly everyone you know will be gone one day.
"another challenge. must deter the mortals."
i know jiaoqiu always wants me to know my limits and not get carried away, but now is the time to bring this to a swift end.
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
still, you did end up victorious. i gather congratulations are in order.
but i didn't think there would be this much left over. thank you, kaeya.
oh, i'm afraid i'm not built for hard labor
he may well have had an inkling about there being two "raiden shoguns." but he always acted as if he was completely unaware of it.
she gave the order to expel me herself and refused to see me i never understood that behavior, and i gave up trying to use logic to work it out a long time ago.
asta is an outstanding manager. someone less skilled would have already let us geniuses ruin more than ten space stations.
amazing, absolutely amazing! even the long-lived might not witness something like this in their lifetime! i'm so lucky!
i feel like going back to reality and resting too come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
if i wasn't ningguang, gou san'er probably wouldn't have handed all of these over to us.
because we need geomarrow. after belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. the eternal freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
oh, sorry if we were a little loud. it's always the way, though aeur" it's like that every time i need to ask pops something.
oh, uh not to brag or anything! maybe it's hard to believe. just just pretend i never said anything.
i'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the memory zone.
there's nothing wrong with wanting to win other people's respect. but when has uncle tian ever looked down on you?
there's something wrong with the stuff this guy is shipping -- it's causing damage to other people's goods, and our dock here is liable for the compensation
it's alright, i'll just read it out. if he went to the trouble of writing a letter, there must have been some important things that he wanted to say or at least, record down.
actually, after i got your invitation, i couldn't stop imagining what the express looked like on the inside. i got so excited about it that i couldn't fall asleep all night.
periodically stirring up trouble is part of their tradition entire buildings vanishing into thin air, puppet riots -- you get the picture.
like master, like student i admire your attitude. in any case, if this concerns the fragmentum, then there's no time to lose. where are the monsters? lead the way.
very well, i believe it's my turn to speak.
precisely. now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the hydro archon, i order your arrest.
the only one that strikes me as a little unusual is the qingxu pool redevelopment plan.
speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current inazuma?
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
currently, the shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. so the easiest solution was to announce that i am resting.
i'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. and as a silvermane guard, i have a lot that i need to ascertain. nothing more.
i--it's not that i don't trust you it's just
joel probably hasn't spent much of his life in the city.
no can do, mister -- it's way too late. you won't find anyone at starskiff haven. if your friends made it out, then they'll already be in the safe zone. no need to worry, you'll see them when we get there.
waeur"well maybe it was! i like golden shrimp balls, is that a problem!
i am not who you think i am, nor will my home be as fortunate as your world.
don't worry, i am not reckless, and i won't carelessly alert the thieves. you can certainly trust me by now.
ready to roll? good. then let's pack up and move out.
don't worry, there's enough to go around! on the house -- order whatever you like.
let's go. once this stage play concludes it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
that's what you wanted to ask when we were at uncle anpu's house, right? jabari's one of the villagers you talked to. you know aeur" the one who wanted to treat isak and his grandpa to some food.
what a pity i thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. but alas. the time has come prematurely.
am i right, mister lyney?
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang
the color draws you in. you water it to see it bloom. it rewards you with its fragrance
alright, i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
yes, photographs often record very precious memories.
i am ningguang, tianquan of qixing. you wish to trade? you be my personal bodyguard, and i will show you how to get ahead in liyue.
she said not to open it until we've reached the islands. i think it might be something to use in case of an emergency.
morning can someone fetch me a cup of coffee? more milk, hold the sugar.
let's go. we have to find another path
i brought you guys here, and i'm standing with you till the end!
i need to use the spirit whisper on blade again, but let's play another round first. have you thought of your question? come to me when you're ready. i can wait.
ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy i sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
fine by me. i was going to be looking for my cousin there anyway.
as soon as herta got bored, she forgot about the whole thing, but all her research was recorded in screwllum's database. silver wolf retrieved it when she hacked into planet screwllum
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
what do you mean, "strange"? it took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
haven't i made myself clear? mister dongsheng, you've already been proven guilty of tax evasion. i just came here to see if you'd confess.
hmm well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, i wouldn't say no.
right now, let's follow her train of thought and head to the next puzzle. i hope this time we can get ahead of the bloodhound family. i want to try and avoid using my memokeeper powers.
goodbye. i wish you a very pleasant weinlesefest.
of course! it's just i'm better with brawn than brains
liyue is due another paper snowstorm. this time, you will be the one to change the prevailing weather.
the amount of fireworks they've amassed there is astonishing. not only did they steal the ones in qingce village but also from other locations, too. they've gathered all the stolen goods there.
i know what you've been up to. smuggling weapons to violent brigades in the desert while working for the corps? pretty bold if you ask me.
huh? why do you look so excited?
i make tea for everyone whenever lyney receives a guest.
and i wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. all we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. or just explain it away as a dream.
knowledge is king in sumeru, and their pursuit of it leaves no room for the arts.
so, you're admitting your defeat, huh? if you're not even confident to teach, why don't you let me be the ringmaster instead?
i feel i have grown immensely from my travels with you. if, one day, i finally manage to make my dreams a reality i wonder, will you still be there by my side?
this jack's placement is odd. the chip is buried deep inside. if you don't look closely enough, you won't even find it
but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
there should be a dedicated evacuation team waiting for us. you can go with them.
for chatting with you let's go with tracking techniques, ambush essentials, expanding your network of contacts, and setting up lookouts.
it's just a guess, but there are also some footprints on the ground here.
wanna explore fyxestroll garden with me? i know we're gonna get to the truth this time.
opportunities like this don't come around often. just look at the guests on this ship. they're surely holding a wealth of valuable treasures.
peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while
i knew it no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
my teacher and i have other pressing matters to attend to. please see yourself out.
but, once the formatting is complete, pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish
i hope it will help us save dvalin, like venti says.
over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
mister sampo, take a closer look this is a wonderful smoked red herring.
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
really? but, won't research people make fun of me or something if i ask them about a legend?
why would you suddenly ask a question like that?
that's enough! you've screamed and shouted at each other for long enough. now pipe down, both of you!
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
mister svarog, are you okay? let me repair your language module first
yes, at least according to mister svarog's calculations
i'll consider coming here to relax if i have another opportunity.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
that's certainly part of it. but every bidder will have noticed that none of these items have a particularly high going rate on the market in and of themselves.
i'll be out in a moment. i'm just changing.
no matter what is waiting for us down the line, i will protect everyone especially klee. this is my duty as the acting grand master of the knights of favonius.
back already? you've met with jing yuan and wandered around for a few hours. so, what do you think?
very well. then i hereby declare
big sis! let's go! i want to play in ever-hunt plains!
mm this is why i am so happy whenever i see you making progress.
according to his calculation results, the strength of the underworlders won't be enough to prevent the disaster.
"i disagree with your point of view" that's what i would say if we were still in the plane of euthymia.
if you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. there are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
this ring is a piece of evidence, right?
i appreciate the sentiment, doctor baizhu. i'm just doing my job.
knowing the president, i think he's now ready to entrust you with the future of the alley.
c'mon, is there nothing left to talk about? in that case, let's all get some water and try to think about something else.
umm let me put it this way. i was just worried that you might be getting weary, and if you keep pressing on in that state, you might start to lose sight of the things that made you want to start your journey in the first place.
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
mister svarog, can i delete some of them?
i know mister svarog. he isn't affected by other people's wishes. he only follows logical judgments.
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
to me, that says that whoever's behind this has moved them somewhere else to throw our investigation off course.
just focus on taking care of yourselves, i'll figure out the rest.
that's the advantage of planning this far in advance it was a clever move.
more importantly i hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will help you safely reach the floor right below this room.
see? even march is getting bored of your rambling.
but, we still don't know how to use the magic of this world. we don't even know why the tavern closed in the first place
looks like everyone got out unscathed, but you all look pretty exhausted. rest up, there's no hurry to move on from here.
well, i'll have an honest conversation with grandpa tomorrow, and i won't take any action against guyun until he gives me his reasons.
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
i knew you would keep your promise, after all i'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days aeur" have you managed to get any sleep at all?
i'll send an "invitation" to the preceptors.
mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
but you saw nothing of the countless others who will remember the war quite differently. most people suffered terribly through each day.
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
indeed. in kafka's words that's also a "missing part" of my life.
i'm afraid not. you may or may not have heard, but fontaine once played host to a group known as the marechaussee hunters.
no task can be done without preparation. i just happened to notice a couple suspicious-looking people while you were out investigating.
thank you for the meal. i thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
it'll be fine -- we have other people in the underworld working on the investigation too. besides, we don't have any clues yet, so we may as well do something useful.
since you are witnesses, i suppose i can shield you from arrest aeur" at least until i have received an explanation from takayuki.
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
it's clear to me that i'm not the only one holding this belief aeur" i'm sure my ancestor had similar views.
but the memory zone up ahead appears to be severely twisted. be careful, everyone.
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
it's just because of the ritual. it makes it so that everyone can see them. i know they look like ghosts, but it shouldn't last long
if you ask me, we already have no choice but to confront her about this.
i heard the healer lady is capable of curing all diseases. i'm here for the same reason anyone would be -- for a check-up and consultation.
my people have already prepared the evidence.
the answer lies with the three of you. i'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
yes, though we don't have any clues to go on we should sweep the area again soon. but first, let's focus our attention on the problem at hand.
oleg has always acted on my behalf -- he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the underworld.
great, you've finally gotten your memory back, and i can put down old mettle.
i suppose what it comes down to is the definition of "eternity" she set out with.
she told me that the most important thing about an experience is how you choose to interpret it.
hehe, they symbolize the goddess of flowers after all. it's just a shame that all the real padisarahs went extinct after her death.
today was a reminder that i don't cope well in situations with lots of people. i've improved, but i still get nervous when more than a handful of people are involved.
unfortunately, dan shu is dead, and even her corpse has crumbled into ash. that's one less clue we can pursue.
i've left keqing in charge of the fireworks show. if you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near
who's legally supposed to take care of this kind of thing? the matra? or the corps of thirty?
i figured you would have at least brought a few people along for appearances' sake. it appears i underestimated just how confidential the mission was.
you bet i do. we go way back. he's easy to talk to. watch me persuade him.
stay out of this. you don't understand the situation.
a trap comprises of the following components: bait, a trigger, and a containment device. sometimes, a lethal implement will also be necessary to deal with the prey.
but with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, i need time to give it some thought.
oh, that's right, you were possessed by a heliobus once before -- guess it wasn't a pleasant experience, was it?
also, please allow me to ask, as the final question before the trial begins
is this the right way? it looks like there's a roadblock up ahead.
but he and qianwei are otherwise polar opposites. mingbo is not very articulate and comes across as very timid in conversation.
if the difficulties are purely financial, then there must be a solution. you could put the shows on pause while you look for a sponsor, for instance.
miss acheron's words speak sense. regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. and we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
sure sounds like it. i could only dream of having a cozy job like that.
the holy city's fate is as fragile as thread. i must exercise prudence in order to eliminate sources of potential disaster.
but before i go, can i ask you a question? you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
there are three basic principles for happiness at work - do not be proactive, do not say no, and do not be responsible. you should give it a try~
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
things will be getting messy at the fortress soon. don't run around unnecessarily.
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
meet me on the first floor when you're ready. until then have a pleasant conversation.
i am sorry. it is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
the masters of the night-wind believe they can see human souls, and in ororon's fragmented soul, they saw a possibility for natlan
jackpot. uncle tian here asked me to assess three candidates for him.
so, we've successfully removed the doctor from the picture. also, tighnari's already resting, so he'll be okay.
good night. try not to stay up too late
wait, are you for real?
then i'll show miss charlotte to my home for a little while.
i'm just clearing the stage for the grand entrance -- can't have you three misbehaving in front of the luofu's hotshot general.
yes. at most, these items are only worth a couple of thousand mora.
signing off now! time to get some songwriting going~
dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? after all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of teyvat.
could we perhaps borrow that invoice? we won't have any evidence to bring against dongsheng otherwise.
in fact, despite being referred to as a city, mondstadt is a nation.
what? so is every person in teyvat who doesn't want money gathered here to shoot this film? don't tell me chiori isn't being paid either
whatever your choice is, i will accept it.
proper path? do you mean, everything that happens in the metropole has been planned out since the very beginning?
so... the trial of the heart means knowing how to deal with an overbearing boss.
unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. with his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
aristocratic etiquette is all just for show just smile and nod along! i was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even i don't take them that seriously.
hmm, or perhaps it's not instinct. the strange melody is one of the few pieces of information you have available, after all.
looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of the hunt.
my home world is one of many planets changed by a stellaron *sigh* it's a shame i never got to witness how far it fell at the time.
i guess we should return this little fella and the parts. i think i can i'll repair it.
naeur"no, it's not like that!
what do you think it was about the jade chamber that defeated osial?
for your first time, i shall personally guide you into the depths.
ten years of being sealed away has sapped the underworld's vitality. now that the furnace core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
i admire the work put into the set. still, it's obvious the script writer has never paid a visit to the fortress of meropide.
but when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
got any more tricks up your sleeve? let's see them all.
a stroke of good luck. and a very welcome one.
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
it's a pity that theofan got away. but knowing which harbingers are still looking at liyue is something. it gives me a starting point for my next mission.
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
no need. i asked for you to come, so i won't send you away empty-handed.
you care about her, huh. you must have become close friends.
thank you kindly! shall we head off, then? ogura textiles & kimonos is our first stop.
he knows how to keep his identity hidden, and his sources are fast and reliable i guess he found out about mister norbert's arrest and made a run for it.
mm, feels like a good angle.
asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. i reject the concept of ownership because i don't want the responsibilities that come with it.
leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.
clara? don't worry about her. that girl is best pals with svarog -- she's always following behind him. he wouldn't harm her.
no wonder they like to use analogies such as "pawns" and "chess" to describe people. one momentary lapse of concentration, and suddenly we find ourselves backed into a corner.
if running the store gets a bit too much, take some time off and wait for me to return.
yes where you dealt my forces quite the devastating blow
i understand, but the sound of the shutter and the camera bulb might send it into a frenzy
as you approach the tavern, you find a plainly-dressed woman standing nearby. she appears to be rather troubled about something.
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
hmm... i ended it with a period. it was a statement, not a threat.
this is a big town. where should we start?
he offered me a pile of mora, so i just signed on
xiaohan is the ipc's operation rep in exalting sanctum.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
just like how the cloud knights can eliminate the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but are unable to calm the hearts and minds of the people within the alchemy commission.
i don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for inazuma
the sea of stars is vast and our journeys are difficult and long. please look after yourself, no matter where you are.
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know
my, my you look like a small injured animal. are you still willing to talk to me? of course i'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
i wouldn't say it's a perfect representation of history, but there are definitely some similarities. would you like to hear more about it?
no, it is impossible. i've got proof.
i suppose we can slow down for now then
but the shogun is still running based on her old rules. i can't allow her to make any more mistakes while i am working things out.
i followed you. it seemed to me that danger has followed you more closely as of late.
hmm? haven't i already mentioned that i cannot make food?
hahaha, don't worry about her. she may look tiny and helpless, but she's been through just as many battles as the traveler here.
but now that the islands of narukami and watatsumi are on amiable terms, we're all friends.
watanabe will be stationed in the area. be sure to alert him if anything unexpected happens.
but you needn't worry, at least, not whilst we're investigating this matter. i'm sure you're familiar with the phrase: "a man of moral integrity fears no slanderous attack."
um, maybe we can talk about that later
you all have saved belobog from danger time and time again. we don't have much, but we'd like to say thank you with this small gesture.
and those tracks and metal scratches we noticed earlier
these are memetic remnants of the remembrance?
well then, it's time you felt the power of "mechanical fever!" pela, let's show them what we're made of!
perhaps mister yang has heard -- there is a large boat called the "eventide" anchored along the sea of dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
that would mean his time hasn't come yet. and that there is a more arduous mission for him to see through.
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
i feel like i'm dreaming.
the corps of thirty is in charge of the city's defenses, but we already talked to asfand. they've been fed up with the sages bossing them around.
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
i'm guessing that's one of the prototype synthesizers. there may be a curio code on its base.
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
sometimes i feel that terms like "genius" were originally created for albedo.
i just want to take a look at the weapons and talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
hmm? traveler? paimon? what are you two doing here?
*sigh* i guess i don't have any special insights. i think i think we should ask the merchants what they think.
you don't recognize me? i've told you who i am already aeur" human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
all the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that i added to our novel?
always thrilled to hear you're in good health. but i was really asking about your emotions. have you managed to calm down?
we really don't know how that happened.
it feels surreal that everything worked out for the alley.
"father" took in lyney and me a couple months after that, but she never mentioned anything about crucabena or clervie.
strange why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something
my thesis might just be related to the express... i hope you'll agree to be interviewed later -- i need first-hand information.
long story short, regardless of why the xianzhou alliance invited us, joining this wardance is of august meaning to belobog.
let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the grand narukami shrine?
you guys have some moves. if you need my help with anything, just shout.
i'll go first to give you a demo.
well, i--it's just the dust has settled now. the stellaron problem has been resolved, and cocolia
just like everyone in this story, hurtling onwards along the path of destiny with passion and courage, for the things that breathe meaning into their lives.
you bet! for starters, i'd love to introduce you to my other friends in the forest. even though there have been some misunderstandings in the past, i'm sure they'll welcome the new you with open arms.
but i should remind you that i've never viewed you as a subordinate.
hah, takes a special kind of person to get cyno chasing them all the way to caravan ribat.
don't worry, sakujirou. so far, at least, everything is going according to plan.
huh. so it's selling slowly? why is that?
i must leave now. listen: don't worry. someone will come and find you very soon, just go with them. you won't remember a thing except me.
it looks like that's where they've arranged to meet. sensible choice, i'll give them that.
a businessman from beyond the sky? and he's not on the whistling flames' records weird, why can't i remember him?
abolishing the sakoku decree has a myriad of implications. it would be folly to say that it will be all positive, and there will be no negative repercussions.
i still can't believe it. the whole report reads like a bad joke -- it's simply unimaginable.
still i will give them a little more time. after all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
ah to heck with it! how often do you get to come to the city? let's not get hung up over the prices!
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
hmph, it'll take more than that. but you're not as bad as i took you for. you walk the talk.
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
get with the program, would you? this is a covert surveillance operation. zhiyi may be vigilant, but that doesn't mean the same is true for his drinking buddy.
right! the guide says we should find a flat, dry, sheltered location -- facing the sun at high elevation
actually, i've sensed a familiar feeling ever since i arrived here. it's brought some old memories to mind.
sounds amazing. it's a shame i'm too busy to attend but even if i could, i'd probably just scare people off with my current appearance.
though that was their name, they did not hunt animals, but rather various monsters left behind by the ancient dynasty of king remus.
i hope the name, ningguang, will live on, but not as a person. as more of a symbol.
i know what my friends are capable of, and they're all quite skilled. besides, i need their help.
i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
let's try to find more clues around here first.
these crates have been sitting here for many years, right? even if they have materials in them, are you sure they are still usable?
but i preferred the character design of the deputy sheriff. can it come back?
so i ask you again. your high bidding price aeur" was it motivated by trust? or was it greed?
indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. crafting careful and precise plans like this is simply not their style.
at this rate, by the time the qingxu pool redevelopment plan is ready to roll, they'll be the technical backbone of the team.
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
even if you were the reason that all of this happened, no one would blame you.
you'll be far more use to the city above ground than below. your job as a hunter is more important.
when that day comes, i can serve as your adviser. wouldn't that be nice?
hehe, anyway, all that aside, are you thinking about coming to our event?
i grew up with these guys, and i know they're not bad people. it's just that some situations get so bad that it's difficult to tell good from evil
i'm picking up signals from more puppets somewhere farther in. let's go take a look.
nilou of zubayr theater. i know her really well. we can trust her.
th--that's very reasonable, your honor! thank you. i promise we'll leave after asking our questions.
the prophecy of deliverance is nothing if not ambiguous. it urges us to defy the gods yet refrains from providing a clear glimpse of what lies ahead.
stellarly brutal! you've attained the skills of a semi-emanator when it comes to reciting the ninja mantra!
if our opponents were martial arts types, i could hold my own against them but aurum alley's problems aren't something we can fight off with a sword.
in her, i see the fireflies of the forest, dazzling and bewitching, yet shining only for a brief moment.
on second thought, since you're right here, i must ask you one more question: where is cipher?
if this theory is correct, little layla's wish may yet come true. once you've gotten to know each other, you'll be able to freely communicate without using the wisdom orb.
ready? my stomach's always ready for food and drink!
heh, i just wanted to fix your attitude and rub it in a little. after all, you took your sweet time getting here, and we've got important stuff to take care of.
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
the balladeer is no. six of the fatui harbingers. in terms of strength, he is superior to signora.
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? did something manage to sneak in?
either way, in accordance with established military convention, those who demonstrate outstanding capabilities ought to be rewarded.
why are you so focused on all the wrong things?
they respond to wishes? huh. i've never heard that one before
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
the outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. the children of belobog have made their decision. they have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.
yep aeur" and in fact, their tale specifically emphasizes that most of them were ordinary humans!
but didn't someone work hard to make this? i can't just take it from here
in the time it took you to get here, i already did five laps around the place, downed seven drinks, and even did some clothes shopping.
me? there's not much to talk about
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
that's a story for another time. nothing's more important than ensuring the safety of the countless people on this land of dreams.
oleg and i took vache to the overworld. he made his final request to us: to take him outside the city to the snow plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
me neither i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing
how are things going lately? work is not going well, as usual. i envy the nameless of the express, as they can come and go as they please.
haha, we're of the same mind.
hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
no, i've no need to trouble myself with such frivolous formalities. here, allow me to demonstrate.
my brother can't hold them back by himself. he wasted a lot of energy on us. he's my responsibility now. besides
ah, i should make myself clear. when i said a hundredth of a lifetime
as for the akademiya let's go once i get myself a set of sumeru-style clothes.
i wanted to come here to perform for cocolia. to say goodbye
no need to feel bad, lady bailu. you were in a dreamworld -- none of it was your fault.
i told him to give up whatever he's doing, but he refused. he said they're just one step away from success, so there's no way he can back out now.
yes, alright, amber. i did my job, like i always do. i really don't see what the fuss is all about
so concludes the words of her eminence, the tianquan.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land must have been real too, right?
besides, the sword seems scared of its own master. i'd like to ask him - you claim to cherish your sword as your life, yet you don't even recognize the state it's in right now?
i have no idea. she didn't even leave a note. i was never able to find out where she went.
don't be nervous. everyone at zubayr theater has your back!
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
clean up after yourself. can't you just wipe it off with your hands?
you even have enough time for leisure? it seems you three are a suitable replacement for me after all.
of course, i have armed myself to do far more than smash your alibi. confidence cannot go unfounded, and my foundations are rock-solid.
you made it i thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
while i was sedated, i could still barely hear two people talking next to me. they were discussing everything from the leaves to the water and even the teacups themselves
they say that many years ago, madam yukong was an ace pilot in the cloud knights. she was a "work hard, play harder" type, known for her hot temper and incredible skill.
well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. you're right on time, too.
yeah, but i still hope that things can change. it never hurts to have hope.
but mark my words, droidhead: i will be back for you
everyone's really throwing themselves into their roles. i haven't seen such a fine performance in a long time.
i would be grateful if you could inform the shopkeeper about this. i should return to the station and see how things are going.
of course. to honor martial arts, the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
"i bestow poison in the guise of sweet dew. come the toil of spring and yield of fall, i patiently wait for the branches to be heavy with withered fruits."
fishing isn't the half of it. you'd be amazed at some of the odd jobs i've worked in my time.
right! let's call it a day. and you too, judge hanya -- don't work yourself to death.
if slaying him is our only choice, i will gladly become the knight that leads the charge.
i don't think you'll need my guidance for what comes next.
all in black, surely they're not ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
in that case, before passing judgment, you should first become a better dancer than me.
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
we've heard about this young man called zhiyi who's supposed to be a fantastic fisherman. just wondering if you happened to have heard of him?
i imagine they don't want to leave something stolen in a place where it could be so easily found.
alright, after some discussion, you decide to turn around and head out of the city
i believe that as time goes by, this firework will only grow brighter and more beautiful in your heart.
ah, you mean the little girl in red? i remember her -- i saw her in the overworld at lady bronya's succession ceremony.
we heard about miss firefly from black swan but we never expected miss robin to
thunder's roar, lightning's flash, the wind's assault, and the rain's descent all these things take place with no regard for the feelings of the common people.
the reports look pretty normal today. you can go have some rest.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
in short, everyone needs a reason to stay. i hope you can find yours soon.
scholars are fond of it, but as you can see, there aren't many scholars still studying around these parts. no seller would be able to make a profit here.
if i don't do something about them, then even my brigade or the people of aaru village could become their next target.
i mean no offense. i simply hope that our adepti forebearers would see liyue in a new light.
hahaha, okay, enough serious talk. days off are few and far between, so it'd be a waste not to unwind while i still can.
there are so many of them are you sure the fissure only recently opened up?
ahh, the time is late, and even my tail is falling down. my apologies, i will be excusing myself
so, master dugu. have you heard of one by the name of zhiyi?
don't worry about it! it's just nice to go clothes shopping together.
now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits"? anyone?
still, who knows how this space is planning on revealing the answer to us.
all the shots had great composition, and i could really feel a connection to the characters and their lines
well then i'm sorry, but what i'm about to say may simply come across as making excuses.
third mirror! stop that nightmarish cackle. it's giving me goosebumps.
i've also heard some things about this card snatcher you're pursuing.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
if nothing else, we can safely say that we accomplished what we set out to do.
it appears to have a malfunction, but i think i can understand it
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
i am sorry for our improper management, and i truly appreciate your assistance, general.
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
then keep that fire burning and learn with all your heart.
i'm at your service. i will not disappoint.
absolutely. she is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. she's worked several days without a break now.
hehe, it's kinda embarassing but i was caught up in the moment -- i guess i never thought it through
because i blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.
for instance, it was certainly a pleasant surprise for me today to meet top talents from all around teyvat.
luckily, it looks like choosing the tianshu's successor is suddenly not such a pressing issue after all.
the "super electromagnetic flux player," or "electric guitar" for short.
i look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, mister lyney and miss lynette. that's enough for now. toodle-oo~
hehe, i won't be nervous anymore once i'm more familiar with this place.
i can only conclude that some powerful or wealthy party must have obtained them via illegal means, deploying them as a private force of sorts.
but once the fatui became involved, things got a whole lot more interesting i thought i might have the chance to catch a big fish.
i'll be sure to ask some people i know to see if they'd be willing to act as extras.
hmph, so he told the truth after all. he is actually leaving sumeru.
i wouldn't say you're entirely on your own, hehe when you're ready, let's get going~
but this is sumeru city. candace and i don't have as much freedom to act here, so we're leaving this in your hands.
that's the reason i asked for you to come here. i need your advice.
hmph so you want to go out in a blaze of glory.
oh, okay, i see. so ei's decided to palm inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date
the traveler is right. you once investigated that underwater sinthe base, and recovered items belonging to the victims.
i took the liberty of writing them all down. this way, you will be able to adapt with speed, no matter how the events play out.
that's him if the legends are true, then he was a man who created an aeon.
i will not forget this. i shall be sure to repay your kindness at an appropriate juncture.
still, it doesn't look like they're rolling out the red carpet we might be getting ahead of ourselves.
let's focus on the business at hand. that miner we met said his brother came this way -- we should look around.
again i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
that's true. i hope that becomes a reality one day.
the next battle round begins now.
stay? but herta
rules, societal dos and don'ts, all these made-up human moral codes -- i've given it my all, but i just can't seem to shirk them!
you were right when you said that as master diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
so you'll stay and keep her company, yes? don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
this is the ninja mantra. embellishing words with ninja enchantments is bound to make the play a hundred times more vivid.
dan heng, i smell a strange scent in the air. it seems the elder is welcoming us with some hidden tricks. could you please track down the source of this scent and put it out?
hahaha, no merc can afford to slack off on gathering intelligence! every mora i've spent in the tavern has been a valuable investment.
ah, then perhaps we should thank the stars that we were able to wrap both of your parts so quickly today. switching around the filming schedule would have been a real pain.
lyney asked me to wait here for you, remember?
the pleasure is all mine, "sole of the deep."
it's like that party game that the people of the yaoqing love to play: they hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
oops, there i am rambling on again i almost forgot you're still in the middle of a tournament! good luck! i can't wait to see what you're gonna pull off next!
does not a single person dare to face me?
sure, why not. i should have some time later. i'll let you know.
i appreciate your kindness but there's no need for your words of comfort.
well, i try to keep my professional and private life separate. that includes my behavior.
i am indeed. many of them, in fact.
that's how things were until the day we fell out. a lot of our shared possessions never left her office again
i disagree. you're a great secretary in your own right.
i'm here for the watchmaker's legacy... and that's it. i think i've been honest enough.
but given the present circumstances, i'm afraid i must regretfully decline your casting request.
the end of the story needs to focus back on aurelie herself. she's the true star of the show.
at some point, she started going down a path that became increasingly difficult for me to join her on.
cut that out! those weird noises make me seem like i've got a few screws loose. put that little thief to sleep for now. we can decide her fate later.
really? huh, i heard that klee's bag almost flew away on the ride. if kaeya hadn't managed to quickly catch it, countless jumpy dumpties would have been thrown into the air.
the part that was corroded is irreversible, so the space station will always be in a state of quasi-fragmentum.
the strength gained through my own hard work is truly fulfilling. hehe, thanks for your support.
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
but you don't belong to this world. perhaps you are just the company she needs.
the captain is taken aback by your sudden question. still, his shock only lends credence to your theory.
ah, good show today, both of you. it was so much fun to watch.
no need. i already talked to some other knights, so i think i have fairly good understanding of the situation.
anyway, i'm not here to harp on you. i just need to know one thing aeur" which way did he run?
"the elite player has already bested last year's champion, and claimed this year's title. hence, this year's event will crown two champions."
well, i guess that's that. we're on our own now. let's keep going.
where is he now? does he have plans to visit inazuma? if so, i will instruct one of the commissioners to bring him to me on his arrival. i would very much like to spar with him.
i think it should be your choice, and yours alone.
everyone, let's head to the central platform.
once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
that's true. and that's why i'm also here for another purpose -- to visit hoolay.
bumping into you like this will become a rarity. ah, i'm starting to feel sad just thinking about it.
we were just talking to her in the museum do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
sorry. i couldn't hear you clearly. could you repeat that?
thank you, honorary knight. i am very satisfied.
but our enemy has long lain hidden within the harbor. if we do not act against them now, they will surely gain the upper hand.
of course not. two senior members of wildfire duking it out in the fight club? that would be bad form.
even after your rebirth, your moves and techniques haven't changed one bit.
the forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
on the xianzhou zhuming, the judges cast those unforgivable and nearly immortal abominations of abundance into the eternal flames of the stars, reducing them to ashes.
are you leaving? yeah, it's about time for me to go, too i've taken enough time out for one day.
a kindhearted cat-eared gentleman on the way over
at the westernmost part of natlan. it's a very remote location, far away from any of the tribes. there never used to be a settlement there, but there's been more people since the mare jivari disappeared.
please, don't fight. i know everyone wants the tavern to reopen as soon as possible so that the forest can return to normal.
let's see which adeptus shall we visit first?
there's no need to blame yourself. this was cirrus's plan all along.
among the piles of texts on governmental affairs and diplomacy, there were a few books on the art of war. they were like gems to me.
did you now? well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
i don't know much about the grand bazaar, but i do know that the residents here have a penchant for song and dance heh, two things that the akademiya doesn't particularly approve of.
so, this is the past of the kalevalan people's sword of heroes? you helped the people of that world bring an end to war?
the fragmentum corrosion is weaker here... i wonder what's controlling it?
why don't the both of you tour our "holy city"? see how our people make ends meet in this difficult time. i will have your welcome gifts ready later today.
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
*sigh* i was hoping to avoid a conflict with the cloud knights. how about this
wonderful. it would be an honor to serve as adviser for our young mage.
"what follows in these pages is the ordinary, everyday life of a regular person. nothing more, nothing less."
foolish question. there are only two kinds of foods aeur" those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.
it didn't seem to make much difference though. still, at least we can understand what he's saying i'll leave him alone for now.
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
no, seriously, it does though. in fact, it's how i used to find my tortoise whenever he went missing.
after all, a life with no obstacles tends to narrow the mind. people end up believing that only they are on the right path. sometimes, obstacles are more valuable than smooth sailing.
a lion has to return to the wild sooner or later. if anything, being your bodyguard has been unfamiliar territory for me.
"at the end of your journey, all that perplexes you and troubles you will resolve."
the arbiter-generals concluded that phantylia did not intend for you to survive. if utilized strategically, this could give the alliance an element of surprise.
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
hey, lay off, alright! my bluff is hanging from a thread here.
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
the next stop, to pave the way for the future that is written.
do i really have to go back to the luofu?
you're on duty, soldier. stay focused!
thank you so much, both of you. i'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
you are forbidden from leaving the sky-faring commission until the aforementioned questions have been investigated.
as long as you let your consciousness freely drift, it doesn't matter where you are.
listen: remember what you're feeling in this moment. as long as you know in your heart where you're heading, you are guaranteed to see the ending of your story.
yes, but ororon's a special case.
little misha and old mikhail's homeland having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
oh, no. he's completely captivated by the power of that cursed sword.
though these immortal mountains have lost an adeptus, the harbor of mortals has gained a wise elder.
it's okay, i've thought it through if it were up to me, i'd sign the contract.
i clearly remember that on my first day as priestess, i had well over one hundred people come pay their respects to me.
please excuse the interruption.
we're here now, so no point dwelling on that. even though this extravaganza isn't a holiday or anything, it's still a big deal here in sumeru.
even if i had that kind of power, i wouldn't dream of abusing it. i assure you, the dried fruits and pastries i brought are quite ordinary.
but i'm sure if you keep going as you are, getting yourselves involved in other people's business all the time, you're sure to get caught up in another misadventure before too long.
barbara is a hard worker, but i feel she's too hard on herself sometimes what? you ask me how i know all of this? it's because the order also manages the church.
bailu told me you two heard me yelling before you showed up. is that true?
ahh, i see! silent but deadly told me something about meeting up with a friend. you must be them?
hmph, you're about to come face to face with reality.
exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. fortunately, i've already managed to identify the author aeur" he's a failed light novelist named tomoyuki.
klee, you always say that. i hope you will abide by your words this time.
oh, it's you. do you have something to report?
here, this medicine is named "yabruh." a tiny dose can numb the body's senses and alleviate any sensation of pain.
er just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it?
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
the memokeeper on the express
if that's the case, it's all the more reason for me not to return to the luofu and complicate things. i might as well take advantage of this situation.
well, that's one reason, anyway i can explain in more detail another time.
it seems like someone has been awaiting us. ready to step into the spotlight now?
but i don't feel that making it easier to learn is necessarily a good thing.
make any funny moves, and i'll smash that scrap metal.
i won't comment on anything else, but the script was good.
i know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
no way. as long as lynxy can protect herself, i'll be supportive in all her ventures!
so, how long am i going to have to play this role?
naturally. we have long foreseen this attack and didn't intend to waste such a golden opportunity.
and even ei is finally starting to come to her senses. quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
but just as arrangements for the peace talks began to fall into place, i started hearing rumors of collusion between the kujou clan and the fatui. allegedly, their goal is to completely wipe out watatsumi island.
how'd you like that story? i even came up with a scary version -- wanna hear it?
next time you visit, i'll take you to visit watatsumi island's old shrine.
you should stay here, little layla. i understand that you want to help haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. leave it to them this time.
the weather and our moods are the same aeur" they can both get gloomy. it's all right, though, because the sky will become even brighter after the rain.
she seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and it's related to the watchmaker.
the only other way to affect the anemo god's power is to take the holy lyre.
the antagonists? you mean all the people who behaved foolishly? what can i say, they're bad people and they all got what they deserved. end of story.
don't treat me like a new recruit. i'm all too familiar with the monsters of the fragmentum. let's get ready to fight!
at first, i wasn't completely serious about using the opportunity to travel abroad to see a meteor shower
but i have with me a letter from lady ningguang. she extends a formal invitation to you in her capacity as tianquan.
actually, i do understand what you meant, lisa.
in that case as a leader, i must give you a promise of the same weight.
elio ordered sam and i to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
why do you think i've come here? we've found a way to dispel the eternal freeze, to seal the fragmentum. it might be the only lifeline this world has left!
hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
we foxians don't live as long as the xianzhou locals, but i still want to enjoy the hundred-odd years i've got left. you'd do the same in my shoes, wouldn't you?
well, it's almost time. let's send her home.
perhaps i'm just not used to such a peaceful vista. if the luofu's skies can become as calm as this, maybe i'll eventually get used to it.
i hope that it might be a highlight of your journey. if you ever grow weary in your travels, know that you can always come back and visit liyue.
which causes your sword's song to become somewhat mumbled at the end.
there was a beautiful dancer, and from the moment i saw her, i couldn't look away.
he entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. if that's the case he should have seen everything that happened here
please, do i look like someone who would fall for that sort of marketing trap?
it all comes down to knowing the rules.
hmm i didn't really give it much thought. but traveling with you bunch does always lead to unexpected surprises.
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
it seems like the craftsmen are too afraid to go in, but they have nowhere to run to either. we should take care, benefactors -- something terrible must have happened.
just come back once in a while. you will always be welcome at the space station -- just don't stay for too long.
haha, we'll see. i just hope the tingyun in your memories won't be tainted by phantylia anymore.
i saw her exit the venue after the semifinals, but she hasn't returned since.
as i said, i need to think about inazuma's eternity. and thinking takes time.
very well. now, please close your eyes...
peace is the best for business. it's best to work with persuadable people. for those who are less persuadable, cooling them down with a fan works wonders.
although, if clara hadn't been here svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
this isn't going as planned what should we do?
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze
i hope you have an amazing journey, serval. do remember to visit home when you get the chance.
i seem to hear a note of pity in that question. perhaps you find us to be weak and defenseless.
i've compiled the details into a written analysis. if you're interested, feel free to take a look.
i hate removing splinters. you have to squint so hard to see them, and i always end up hurting myself i've cut all ten of my fingers that way
what must have transpired to cause her such a drastic change? still, orders are orders. it's not for soldiers to question their superiors.
so, this guy is the source of it all, right? if we take him out, the fragmentum activity in this area should subside for a while
keep it safe? is that all you intend to do with it?
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations
i'll give it my all, so don't hold back.
i know you said it's perfectly safe here, but to go to bed without someone on lookout i don't think i'm used to that yet.
just talking about it is a waste of time. since we're already here, let's go and scout out the situation ourselves.
tighnari was first, and as for the second it's being discussed right now.
whether it's a dragon lady like you or an ordinary person like me, i feel like many people's lives follow a similar trajectory.
everyone, get ready. this could be a tough battle.
so that's still on your mind, huh? maybe you're the ones who can't let things go.
i'm sorry that you have to see me in this state
well, it'll take a while to tell.
he's so young, but a cloud knight lieutenant already!? could he have a ma more strict than mine urging him on with swordplay?
hmm sounds like a good idea. maybe that's something i should do.
since this definitely won't be your last escapade, here's a little tip you should at least make it look like your room and things are still in order when you leave. also, you'll need someone to cover for you when you're out and about.
thank goodness you take the time to perfect these inventions, master! if not, the sky-faring commission would've become quite redundant by now.
huh? oh, uh no need. actually i was just being polite, i don't see why not.
i was never much of a fighter, and i'm not one for risking my life either. getting diting into your hands is already beyond the realm of my job description.
are you trying to scare people away?
before ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet
since that's your testimony, i have no more questions. it appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case
i'll be sure that the police station prepares the appropriate compensation.
i think so too. the composition needs a little jazzing up.
is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? how does it taste? and how do you cook it?
i told you, it's purely out of a spirit of competitiveness.
by the way remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
he told me that he wasn't sure who my mother was, and in any case, she never came to see me.
there's nothing to say about your past. you only remember me because i was the one with you when your soul was born.
erm i'm sorry, i just suddenly felt some strong emotions. let's get back to work on repairing the small robot.
judges are instructed by the ten lords to carry out their orders, but no one ever explains their meaning to us
in other words do you want to try my home-made matcha?
what is all of this complaining about? you made a promise to my grandfather and now you want to run away? get out there, now!
all in the name of vengeance, no need to thank me.
as far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. they complemented each other, and they ruled inazuma jointly. so there was no need for the public to know the truth.
we've looked everywhere but here i hope my memory is right.
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
in danger? what do you mean?
there might be spare stove parts in the ruin. lemme see
you reach toward your waist, but find nothing there. you now recall that your weapons were confiscated before the guards locked you in the cell the bag of treasure along with them.
this is something from when i was a child.
my mother mentioned in her notebook that tsubaki enjoys food from all over the world.
naturally, take your time.
judging by where it's docked, it must be heading for central starskiff haven. nice, we'll be safe there.
denied. use of force has been forbidden.
oh, must be the key to the big door
the only reliable speculation is that it favors those caught in dire circumstances and bestows miracles upon them.
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
yo, why the exhaustion? you look like the officers over at the realm-keeping commission.
you're right but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
that's impossible. it was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
a fresh catch can go straight on the grill with minimal preparation and it tastes delicious, even with no seasoning.
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
hmm, things are going a little too smoothly today
seriously? it's the first day, and you two are already late? why is everyone on the luofu so laid-back? so disappointing.
also, please stop making it sound as if i somehow need the company.
our paradise is none of your concern, masked fool. leave now, or the family won't tolerate you anymore.
jing yuan you haven't changed at all -- always trying to destroy the plans of others
the problem is, any suspicious incident could be tail-related when you think about it
of course, if there is a day when the underworld doesn't need a doctor like me anymore and everyone lives happily ever after
i am jean, acting grand master of the knights of favonius. this is lisa, our resident librarian.
this grand festival is drawing to its close. this is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in penacony.
alright, then. good night, everyone. and don't go thinking that granny itztli doesn't like hanging out with you just because she's not around all the time.
leyla's parents gave me the address of the camp, so i went and checked it out. there were clear traces of spiritual energy, and also look what i found.
i've faced many opponents in my duels. most of them, i defeated. the rest surrendered. hm? no. i have never lost a duel.
i wouldn't dare "let go" and "relax." however, i am more than grateful for being able to rest here for a while.
don't be ridiculous, luka. still, whatever your motivation was, i hope you can find a different outlet for it.
guyun flew out of the case on its own. the knight of beauty only unlocked the box to aid its escape.
i want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. it meant a lot to me.
ahh, i haven't been here for a while -- it's nice to be back in the old stomping ground.
records from heron express show that this container was sent by a person named "a-feng." what do you have to say about that?
as i thought, you've carefully observed the streets of liyue.
well, how is it? are you enjoying the feast today? if there's anything you're unhappy with, just let me know. i'll be sure to take note of it.
this is barbara, the deaconess of the church. she is here to retrieve the holy lyre der himmel.
now that i think about it perhaps i was too naive. she'd probably forgotten it even existed.
trust me. when have i ever been wrong about something like this?
that way i won't have to hide behind mister svarog anymore.
food preferences? that's a little unexpected.
besides, there's no need to be nervous. this project is destined for success, i feel quite optimistic about it.
ah, boss, see these two faces here? remember them. they're the ones picking up the bill later.
you astral express trailblazers have outstanding manners, though your allegories are a little odd
um i guess you could slip away and find a safe spot to hide. i'll come back and get you once i've sent her on her way.
yep, you got it. i've heard that you've already crossed paths with ayn al-ahmar? they're one of the groups under the relics' banner.
i mean, this is my first time inside a teapot. i doubt anyone would believe me if i told them.
if we were to create a trap now, how would you design it?
that's why we hope that your time at zubayr theater will become a fond memory of your journey. you two are welcome back anytime!
i don't think it's a good idea for you to be this close. if it corrupts you again, it's possible you might take on a new form entirely.
i trust that one day, her present experiences will become unique memories.
fascinating. i'm learning a lot today. let's get this underway.
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
thanks again for your help. if you run into any snags along the way, i'll do anything in my power to support you.
life is ephemeral, and i only wish to be a piercing arrowhead -- to be the hunt -- until my very last breath.
ahem anyway, xilonen, i heard that you require my help in crafting an ancient name?
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
there's already one lit device here. it appears that we need to find the other three and light them up as well.
yes, she works at yuehai pavilion, and she's my junior. how can i help her?
yep. you pick, red or blue?
as a warrior yourself, i don't believe you require my help. but should you ever wish to borrow my strength, i will fight for you with everything i have. as always.
she's actually a very reasonable old girl in private.
just me? why can't we just talk here?
what am i gonna do why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish
playing the violin and firing a gun both require flexible fingers, but bullets are more obedient.
it's been ten years, jemma. aren't you tired of the grieving widow act? i think it's time to put an end to it.
the answer is simple: it's because the assistant detective is the murderer.
as for you, traveler, you're our esteemed guest. please take the opportunity to stay in liyue harbor and enjoy the festivities.
see? see? how can you compete with me? i'll teach march seventh the essence of zhuming swordplay, so she can win the contest with my sword skills.
meh, whatever. we have to get rid of them anyway. alright, stay close and try to avoid shattering to pieces!
when i first got to the space station, the researchers had prepared a room for me. i--i was really grateful, but it was far away from everyone else. that was a bit disheartening.
you can't even imagine the atmosphere there -- even someone as heartless as me got the chills! i only stayed for a day before i couldn't take it anymore and slipped away.
the one closest to death often knows the most about how precious life is. her embrace brings eternal sleep, but such farewells are always warm.
madame kujou, this is rather serious. i believe you owe watatsumi island an explanation?
the restricted zone front line is on the other side of the gear bridge. it's an endless fragmentum with a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
haha, oh yeah? well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
this is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
um, i'll go get the box and slips of paper for the lots. please wait a moment
we'll see the candidates now. let's do one at a time aeur" start with qianwei.
after troubling you all this time, i couldn't leave without properly expressing my thanks. here's a dream bubble for you -- i hope you enjoy it.
it's the weirdest thing. i remember i was reading a book at the grand bazaar, and then i guess i must have fallen asleep at some point, because well, then i woke up dressed like this
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
regardless, whether the reason behind the present threat is clear or not, i'll handle the situation.
but not to worry, it's just training after all. let's try again.
if she can delegate more resources to the investigation, that should help it move forward faster.
come with us for now. i'll take care of things here later.
from your description, i suspect you were dealing with a "devorator."
i understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. however, before that, it's essential to know that...
hey, way to boost morale over there!
lisa, "humble clerical staff" do not wield electro the way you do.
at first, it was but the size of one room. now, it is large enough to blot out the moon in the skies above liyue.
welcome to bonajade exchange, radiant feldspar branch.
you have a last-minute job for me? okay, uh sorry, please don't try and explain it all verbally write it down, leave a note here. i'll get to it as soon as possible.
regardless whose idea it was this place has been designated as a restricted area. no one is allowed to enter.
i understand. the more that weighs on your mind, the more your fears become dreamscapes.
i am fortunate to have had lady guuji's help this time. i likely would have struggled to find a candidate on my own.
aventurine? is he still alive? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
i know. but since we were looking for food, i figured we might as well try to fix the stove.
in any case, since you remember what happened just now well, that's put my mind at ease.
what's going on? why is it getting hot in the memoria?
ah, no i was just up late last night reading some novels what does sleeping in have to do with the weather?
i don't know how deshret's relics sees it, all i do know is that dakan al-ahmar has become more and more aggressive over the last few years.
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
thank you. you can also move a little to your left. the water is warmer there.
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
sounds good. remember to always watch where you're going, and don't rush.
but why would they kidnap a kid who just spends his days living in the country and raising aphids? he's only in his twenties. what would they want with him?
i have added the memory from earlier into this. if ninja gama does not lie, this will become the blade to slay those fiendlings.
soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
people still use mora in commercial transactions, i assume?
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya
do you really think the hunters acted out of a desire for honor and glory, or to be loved and acknowledged by the people? what did your father teach you about our order?
did there use to be a temple here?
got any more encouraging words?
well, right now, i'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
attachment, desire, longing... they may all be right, but they are all incomplete.
hmm, maybe some of your neural circuitry is less intact than i thought
the masked fools so this really was their doing.
so help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
the atmosphere in this park is excellent. thank you
yeah, from the other books i read, it seems like this goddess really likes to play fast and loose with the details.
well, uhh you do look very different from other people.
i have a very effective way of training for this. come with me to dragonspine.
was this an accidental achievement on your part? or have you studied the art of war in great depth?
qiqi likes finches, right? i'm thinking of making her one out of rattan! do you know her favorite color?
you took your time. i was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, miss "sole of the deep."
actually i want to know too. but as a guest on the express, it would be impolite to touch anything.
forget it. if you see her, let her know this: as demigods, we can't avoid our duties forever.
so alice went to all these lengths because she was too busy to be with klee?
the third child of the landau family, right? i've heard gepard mention her before, but i've yet to meet her. from what i've heard, "lynxy" -- as they call her -- is very smart for her age.
we're here at marmoreal palace, okhema's public baths. normally, this place would be much livelier.
i'm heading out. i hope the next time we meet, we'll both have several more victories to our names.
aww, what are you talking about? the fun's just about to begin.
hehe, well you are in the dreamscape, after all.
the port is crawling with fatui soldiers
you promised me, qingni! we shall discuss this when we return.
everyone, as the grand master mentioned in his letter, the weinlesefest is in just a few days. and how fortunate we are at this time to receive word that all is well with the expedition.
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
oh? and how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
but general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
you call that normal? i might have let it slide if it was in the cage on second thought, no, that was cringe even by fight club standards.
a ninja's super hearing can capture even the death of a proton. you spoke loudly before me. i wasn't eavesdropping.
sweet dreams soda?
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
if you treat your lives as mere trifles, then you may do as you wish.
y'know, whenever the express stops at the station platform, i make a point of getting a few visits in.
you want me to go through here? do i have to fight it?
darn, the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish causal relationships.
and so elio saw a new future possibility.
who is it? shop's closed today, you'll have to come back tomorrow!
our people? or someone from the ipc?
it's rare to hear such comforting words from you. i graciously accept them.
your ship can leave whenever you want, but i'm afraid i can't say the same for the cargo.
shh, that's a brave thing to say out in the open if the cloud knights hear you, they won't think twice.
it's the exact location of the scene, as well as the formal permission to use the venue. seems like they have everything prepared.
you should meet the others of the genius society. some of them will trick you into thanking them after they milk you dry. at least i have my honesty going for me.
of course not~ i'm just amazed at this fancy technique of yours, as usual.
so your choice is?
so, i'm trapped between life and death, existing in a limbo?
*sigh* i've had a lot of free time recently, so i was thinking about writing some new songs. sadly, that's about as far as i got
greetings, guests from the astral express.
if you have any other questions, you are welcome to come to himeko and me.
lady fu xuan has such refined taste? the xianzhou really has changed a lot in the time i've been asleep.
uhh if you can, please try not to upset mister svarog
the city is still shrouded in a gloomy, oppressive atmosphere, but your spirits are surprisingly high.
pascal, we've got mister svarog to help treat your illness. he'll help you recover.
you ready yet? if you want to keep wasting time, i'll just go on ahead by myself.
rahman, give me a few men to help us escort the village keepers back to the village. and these two scholars aeur" they're coming too.
leave this round to us! i got interrupted earlier, but now i have something to take my anger out on!
well, that's obvious, but what i truly wanted to know is: this project is obviously too bland for your taste, isn't it?
such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, but as a means to an end i need to put this aside for a more indifferent process.
what do you know? silent but deadly speaks.
there's no stopping you once you've made up your mind. fine, we'll do it your way.
"come to clock studios theme park to learn more about the history of the planet of festivities!" i think the general will like this gift.
now then, i'll entrust the preparation efforts to all of you.
but, i can tell you one thing: my favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
you guys can hang around here, but don't run off too far -- there'll be cloud knights coming to escort you back soon. bye for now!
don't worry judge huohuo. effective communication with the public is one of the basic skills of a cloud knight~
i'll help you. no matter where it is, you must be reunited!
the delusions they're still on your mind, aren't they?
the technology wasn't mature enough at that time, so the excavation project was shut down, and the "treasure" became a mere legend.
that's why i went into vacation mode the second i boarded the express -- thesis topics don't unearth themselves y'know.
no, i can't but more importantly, what kind of "foul language" were you using?
by following the threads of fate, you have begun to write the opening chapter of your story. how do you feel?
perhaps someone you've met or something you've experienced here. or perhaps you enjoy the atmosphere of liyue and you will become accustomed to it.
yo, remember, i'll need your help. let's go.
its great weight meant that it hit osial with incredible force, while the energy within triggered that spectacular explosion.
it would seem we've cleared every abomination from the area. let's find another location and continue our contest.
a world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the garden of recollection
heh, if you think you can just take this sword from my hand, go ahead and try.
that's what i've been puzzled about too. i never actually saw how phantylia managed to disguise herself as me.
before you, the door to the treasure, sealed and undisturbed for more than a hundred years, finally swings open.
patrolling the streets is the tenryou commission's job. the shogun has a lot of information to process and orders to give out. she doesn't have time to deal with it herself.
hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in inazuma. they even handed out flyers in front of yae publishing house.
stellaron hunter: sam.
more manpower is always a good thing, since the skysplitter is so large. oh, and by the way, you should know that--
i've probably got a thirty% chance, or less.
lady bailu has small hands but is very skilled i have to go lie down and have a massage with her every time i return to the luofu.
i sincerely wish that this will be our last meeting.
it's you. don't sneak up behind me next time. lucky for you i wasn't armed.
no, i won't let that happen.
well, don't blame me if i find it first and melt it down.
when there's nothing to do, we often sneak out from here and spend a few hours lazing around outside.
to be frank, i'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural i often worry that i haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
keeping such a conspicuous piece of art around wouldn't go unnoticed the thieves must have disassembled it and hidden the parts inside the robots.
besides, i'm sure you won't be on watatsumi island forever. whatever titles we may have, we're friends first and foremost.
i'm good at documenting information and coming up with my analysis. acting on that analysis is the captain's job.
the shogun's army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this shuumatsuban ninja, i'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
he expressed a desire to be on the front line, so i honored his wishes.
certainly! you can also tell my friend in yanshang teahouse about what they're up to. i'm sure my friend would also like to say hi to them.
since i'm already wearing the costume, though, i might as well try to play the part. it's what a professional dancer would do.
which means seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
but now, the youkai memories that leak from the ley lines are weak. they are no longer able to fly.
as for me i don't mind trying my hand at the trending games from time to time, though i still prefer chess.
all gods don't have the same secrets, you know. she was herself, and i'm me. is it really so strange that i know nothing?
you're saying you like how i wear my vision? you certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. well then, i bet you'd like to pet it.
unfortunately, since i didn't manage to procure one for myself, i'm unable to say for sure.
only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.
i later saw you walking into the same room, so i began to connect the dots. the situation got a bit tense... i hope you don't mind that i pulled this stunt.
exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
for this reason, mondstadters call the western wind the "returning wind." the weinlesefest originally began as a celebration to welcome lord barbatos on his return.
ugh, that noise! do fragmentum monsters usually sound like this?
are ya serious, chief? all the akademiya students are in sumeru city, you know why should they pretend to be students in port ormos?
your eyes are working just fine aeur" yes, i have two tails. you wanna pet them?
before i lost my memory so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
hmm sounds like you know a lot about him?
why, of course i do. allow me to take the first shot and break this case wide open. mister lyney is clearly lying.
sometimes, you can convey more with dance than words. if you don't know what to say, then just dance.
it's not right! so, when i learned the ceremony had failed, i was ashamed by my inaction and absolutely relieved by the result.
so the burden of mentoring you fell on me. it was a stressful job, and i dumped you on the train as soon as i got the chance.
forget it. i'm sure you can find a better theme than that, miss charlotte.
"what's that dolt gepard up to now? luka, you'd better fight like your life is on the line! if you lose, i'll make sure you wish you were really dead!"
i didn't expect to meet you here. we were just talking about tails
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
is that important? all that matters is that they work and are able to attract droidhead's attention.
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
actually, i was just talking to myself i don't think this question can be answered.
to be brutally honest for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
hey, are you sure? maybe a couple of punches will help to jog your memory?
lady guuji, i need you to be direct. tell me exactly what you mean.
you have quite the sense of humor, benefactors i've encountered more trouble with you than i have with the merchant fleet in ten years.
the golden thread has exposed your hesitations. regrettably, the both of you have failed the test.
mister khasani found a new way to look at art. he decided to stay at the theater to watch us grow.
your match is over too? you took your time. i'm assuming it was a close call
for example my name is sangonomiya kokomi, the divine priestess of watatsumi island
i understand. i shall become your shadow, just as you were once makoto's shadow.
indeed. then perhaps you could tell us everything that happened during that one minute.
when that happens, they will be ready to face the world head-on and become exceptional businessmen and women. but until then, i am here to protect them.
thanks to both your help, everything went smoother than i expected. and it looks like we still have some time to spare.
this calls for brainwaves, not "brawnwaves." how about i take you over myself?
it's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that i'm used to.
yes sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
the sofas here on the express are too comfy. after falling asleep even my dreams are soft and cuddly.
the gate won't budge in this time dimension how about recovering the "miracle" from the tome?
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
nope. apart from this boring festival, i have no dealings with the man.
claiming to have family ties with the enemy sounds to me like an attempt at asking for mercy hoolay, are you begging me for mercy?
didn't think you were the type to get bored sure, speak.
yanfei, see that thing on the ground?
besides, this has only come about because i failed to make a timely decision. this issue started with me, and i shall be the one to finish it.
yes. i think you'll understand the significance once you see it in short, i need you to help us evaluate our current progress.
weird that's what the guide says
so, that's why gepard and i came up with this idea. we'd like you to help us find out what's going on!
of course, that can't be undone now. it's too late, and i have no intention of reinventing myself all over again.
i'll give you a clue: she's currently in charge of the shogun's army, she visits the shrine at this time every month, and she is our guest today.
madam yukong, you were once a "survivor" in the war too, weren't you?
just open your eyes! surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? we've had nothing but critical acclaim!
she's one of the souls that overflowed from the night kingdom. she can no longer go back there.
i suppose this is the new way of life, then. i'm not going to complain. i'll try to embrace it.
i am confident it will prove very useful in dealing with future crises.
my wardrobe? it's probably close to twice the size of the space station. ah, the world lost an emanator of beauty the moment nous cut in line and gazed upon me first!
don't worry, huitzilin's technique hasn't been lost at all. come with me, i'll explain everything at my house.
somehow, i feel even more tense after playing a few matches than i did before
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
even if the ending of the story may be childish and ridiculous, it won't really matter
how can words suffice? hmm in this world, seeing is believing.
go? go where? the luofu is under lockdown -- the cloud knights' operation isn't over yet.
okay, we're done with chapter one. let's move on to chapter two.
alright! when people ask you, you might as well tell them this loud and clear.
in the meantime i'm gonna figure out how to boost my victory rating. good luck!
i see so you noticed something was up with the akademiya from the very beginning.
luckily, there were only two of us, and both of us were nimble enough to dodge most of the strikes. there were a lot of fatui, though, and they were being torn to shreds by the bolts of lightning.
and yet, you were able to retrieve three of the four keys if i remember correctly, each was entrusted to a respected and capable hunter how did you manage it?
is it even awake in there? maybe it's broken down.
but you need not emphasize your role as the honorary knight. you are a traveler from a distant land, and you can approach the aristocrats in this way.
are you sure? i'm not well-read, so i might really believe you!
you were attacked by a lord ravager. by all rights, you should not have survived.
i followed my phlogiston trail earlier to a stronghold guarded by soldiers. i have a feeling that ororon is probably being held inside.
normally, the yuehai pavilion would be responsible for assessing the candidates. isn't that right, uncle tian?
there is still much to do the people will have felt the effects of the engine of creation. there are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal
i have eaten my fill. thank you for your hospitality.
okay guys, take a look over here: this is everwinter monument. it was erected to commemorate the mighty architects.
the lawrence clan is just like this stage. it was once home to glorious performances, but those days are now long gone, and it is time for the stage to be updated.
pascal, why do your peers keep rejecting you
ahhhh. there's nothing like dessert for improving one's mood. much more enjoyable than meditating alone all the time.
the man we ran into he doesn't seem happy at all.
my name is yunli.
you apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the gash, and carefully redress the wound. the man regards you first with bewilderment and then with guilt.
i believe i now understand the situation.
people show you whatever side of themselves they want you to see. i know this for a fact.
perhaps in a few years or maybe a few decades when belobog's weather stabilizes, i'll suggest that bronya construct a railway in the city.
we'll see. let's go back and report to uncle tian.
more about me? mm i don't mind. i only worry that you may find the topic a little boring.
nah, it's more he's just honoring a bet. whether it's apologizing or squealing like a pig, i doubt he'd do it willingly.
you can go and have a look around?
and some tea-flavored hard candies. they're for sigewinne.
this norbert guy, do you know what his line of work was?
well, as luck would have it, i happen to be in a good mood today. how about i tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
i can't shirk my responsibilities. i'll do it.
so tell me, how do you plan to respond to the fontainian musician? it sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
you sound exactly like master yanqing. but for now, both he and yunli have been forced to go to the alchemy commission for some well-needed rest.
calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to what again?
well aren't you lucky. as soon as i closed my eyes, i dreamt of endless running and circling and chasing after lady bailu it was even more exhausting than doing it in real life.
interesting mm, let's run an imaging test first to confirm that your brain has no organic issues. a fighter's bound to run into such problems.
i'll be honest, you guys are hardworking. if everyone from wildfire were as impressive as you on the battlefield, we wouldn't be so hard-pressed by svarog.
let's shake hands! again! again! still remember? it's an expression of happiness and gratitude aeur" a way to express joy at all the good things in life!
oh yeah? since you're so familiar with the place, you can lead the way and conduct the interviews!
the path to hell is paved with heavenly treasure; devils trying to fool you, better get your head together. the hunters hide greed with a welcoming smile; don't be beguiled, it could be your last mile.
the millelith's casualties are within the range we expected.
everyone should enjoy the break while it lasts! i'll convene everyone when the fish arrives.
you two have my thanks. you have done much for me, and i will never forget it.
but don't keep your fungus waiting much longer look, now that it's no longer under the wisdom orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you
huh reminds me of the accusations against me. cocolia's methods haven't changed.
it's completely blocked by the mine cart what do we do? can we blow it up?
he became a hollowed shell in his youth, and the blazing flames of vengeance were the only thing sustaining him.
if kafka is hiding in stargazer navalia, she'll have left behind traces. let's spread out and look for them -- leave no stone unturned.
mm, dreams can be both good and bad because the outcome is uncertain, dreams still cannot heal everything
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy
anyway, if you must know, the divination commission is responsible for gathering intelligence, devising strategies, and performing divination.
listen, i know you academic types love to fill up your big brains with self-righteous morality, and lord your empty rules and virtues over each other
i just want to find a happy corner in the universe and drift wherever the wind blows. if it's not fun anymore, i'll find a way to make it fun!
it is my first day at the alchemy commission -- a brawl is definitely not how i imagined celebrating it.
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
she's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
i was wondering if this troupe is so important to all of you, why does it have to disband?
i can feel your obvious excitement that means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
well, where would we be without our squad leader? we had to help!
ugh, there'll be no need for that. i've seen them already. there's no need to go back over scenes i've witnessed in person before!
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
sure, and then you can forget about any nice words from us.
she clearly not a pathstrider of the hunt. but you are, aren't you? tell me, what's acheron's deal?
we all worked really hard this year. whether traveling or guiding
we all train under grandpa's guidance, learning the art of craftsmanship and swordplay. that's how we got that title, i guess.
the reason is simple: in this grandiose and ostentatious dream of the family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
yeah i can tell people are watching me.
ahem! yae miko said nothing of the sort, and the traveler has some nerve making up spurious claims about her while she is still present.
don't freak him out. i work as the head of the divination commission most of the time.
the mare jivari was reduced to a desolate wasteland after that big battle. or rather, it became known as the mare jivari after what happened there.
although i am no longer required to play the role of the hydro archon, the time i spent inhabiting that character has left an indelible mark on me.
in truth, all monsieur neuvillette asked me was "when did the fortress become so friendly towards the media?"
you all are great storytellers!
perhaps it's best to let go now, while my feelings for pascal aren't as strong?
what a beautiful view. the ocean is good company i hope we can all find some peace and happiness while we're here.
really? the end result is the same, though. exactly what i do and how i do it are just minor technicalities.
enough chit-chat -- look! this is the weird stuff that happened yesterday when i was streaming in fyxestroll garden!
i'll give that poor flying sword some proper maintenance. i won't consider returning the sword unless he learns how to say "please," "hello," "thank you," and "sorry."
well, all the pictures will be shot in the alley. so there you go.
but no matter what their main priorities are, there should always be someone left at the mansion, right?
just look at this flying sword. even if i give it back to you now, it'll just be taken away again in a few hours.
though bailu has been worshiped as the high elder since birth and had no say in this, her title of healer lady was indeed gained from her expert practice of medicine.
here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
they go out drinking? this area isn't exactly renowned for the nightlife. i'm guessing it's a long trip to the nearest tavern?
in there lurks a secret called "device ix"... one day, i'll reach it.
my brother's doing a magic show at the opera house tomorrow evening. would you like to come along? it might raise your spirits.
are you going to help this um, clockie that only you can see?
i'm making early preparations for what is to come.
you really don't think we have a chance at winning the debate?
if you're looking to meet her, the lunarescent depths might be your best bet. i spotted her heading that way earlier.
nobody sets off a firework to feel lonely, do they
what happened? the supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and gepard had to rush back to the front line i don't understand
yes, everyone attending the auction today is in possession of lost property belonging to me.
i have been meaning to have a word with you if the occasion presented itself, but as you know, mondstadt's safety must always be my first priority.
have you noticed? the balladeer is not happy with the doctor's actions. he thinks the doctor has no right to consider himself as his equal.
don't you guys have anything better to do!? what did we do this time?
right -- if the merchant guild pay back what they owe, the only one barking will be that ipc stooge.
i read them all, but only found one reference to magicaeur"
really? thank you. so where is the "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder"?
master diviner, you're not the only one who can design a puzzle, and i don't tread the path of destiny alone.
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like hair accessories or brooches?
no, hold on -- you have a stellaron within you. i think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. it might be dangerous if you stay for too long
*sigh* don't worry, i won't dig too deep. i know bronya must have thought long and hard before deciding what to make public.
i do believe he was prepared for that outcome. i could see it in his eyes.
but, i couldn't fall asleep just anywhere aeur" i needed somewhere private. i didn't want anyone to overhear me sleep-talk or watch me contort myself into some weird position
hee-hee, i knew it! this is what people like us live for. let's go!
don't underestimate my experience.
divination commission? celestial jade? shouldn't they be doing divinations?
i trust that nobody would object to the ending of the story being based on aurelie's true feelings?
let's head back, otherwise mister svarog and pascal will get worried.
gorou, thank you for all you have done.
oh, i see, my apologies, i appear to have interrupted your conversation with mister zhongli.
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
walk with me. let's forget our problems for a while.
but if you're interested, there's a shop selling jade abacus jewelry in starskiff haven -- i can show you around when i'm free.
it's normal for friends to travel home together if they run into each other on the road.
i've heard many good things about you, master xingqiu. thank you for your assistance.
sure, there were clashes and distrust, but virtually everyone was acting in the best interest of the alley. if that hadn't been the case, the whole thing would have fallen apart.
a person is defined by their actions alone i think that's how the saying goes? if the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
*sigh* you did save my life at cloudford consider this my returning the favor.
know myself and know the enemy let's see, who should i ask first?
got it. but it sounds like mister assistant detective has his own misgivings would you like to go over it again?
i hope you realize how lucky you are. if it was anyone else, i don't think i'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
only the lower halves of the barrels appear to have been submerged in water
yeah, thanks to you. i'm really grateful. alright, time to hit the "stage"!
i heard there's a hidden palace deep in the mountains south of stone gate. traditionally, that's believed to be where they retreated for cultivation.
traveler, not long after we met, i remember you mentioning that liyue, mondstadt and every nation has their own unique fashion.
huh? could it be pascal has been repairing this abandoned town?
the way i see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection
but what if the bigger war comes to pass? what then?
mister luka, come take a look. this is the tuskpir treatment that i've prepared for you.
seeing you cooped up in that library all the time, i was worried you might be bored. so i thought i'd give you an opportunity to truly make use of your talents.
oh no! silly me, i almost forgot something super important!
the purchase price of sky-amber doubled to support the lord of preservation. however, it is up to the corporation's fancy whether this becomes good or bad fortune for worlds rich in ores
i'd rather focus on resting first i need to wait for my heart rate to recover before i go chasing another heliobus.
i felt like i was neglecting you guys, so i wanted to find an opportunity to catch up.
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
oh? hello there, little ones.
thank you all for hearing me out. we know very well why the adepti came here today but please forgive us, we cannot yield to your wishes.
do you think i know nothing about the history of penacony? don't drag me into your banal office politics.
yaeur"yeah everyone has their own way with words, and it's really hard to say no
so we made you a little something. hope you'll like it!
is it? i just want them to try it. it would be a shame for them to miss out on dango milk.
it is a pity that i can't help her retrieve her lost memories.
hah, there's plenty of precious stuff in here! you aren't looking for treasure in the museum while pretending to volunteer, right?
i i guess we do.
you can display it at home or hang it on your wheelchair. it'll cheer you up.
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
system space all clear today! great weather for flying!
life is fleeting. we hope you'll have the opportunity to return to us on the luofu soon.
gui, nai, fen! "gui" means fine wood, "nai" means to exist, and "fen" means fragrant -- rolls right off the tongue, doesn't it?
judging from what's left on the scene, there must have been a fight. but after that, the factions seem to have gone their separate ways. both the phlogiston and the elemental traces in the air support that.
hmph. you are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. descendant of the takatsukasa clan, you wish to become the new tenryou commissioner. do i understand this correctly?
in all the time since i took him in, this has never happened.
keen observation. they share the same fundamental logic, and are pretty much identical in that regard.
treat it as a layer of protection. this will shield my research and your personal safety. once the problems have been dealt with, i'll give you the antidote.
but only if you feel this is something that would help, of course.
i haven't had this much fun in a long time
i would've tied them up if it wouldn't have caused a scene.
this transcript records what you asked capote to help you with. here we can see a bossy manager and you being asked to do things outside of your job description.
really? you're just going to stonewall me!?
hmph, delicious unauthorized delicacies sara will pay for this.
after all, it is a lot to live up to.
mister farhad and mister hushang visit even when there isn't a show going on, and they always tell us lots of entertaining stories.
as promised, i've delivered the child to you. our transaction is complete.
it's a shame that i forgot to ask her for her name. i only know that she's from the garden of recollection.
didn't you just say that you were freezing? drink it and it'll help warm you up.
but our mission at yae publishing house is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. it would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
you have a clever tongue. i like it.
ugh! what, are you reading my mind now!?
thank you, esteemed bard with an enchanting voice. your ballads will endure through the ages, serving as a bulwark for okhema.
don't worry, i said "a" drink. that means just one.
their flimsy disguise has been exposed. even if they try to hide, there's no way they can escape us.
i know. we should not have hesitated then. i stopped you before i even realized it myself
it is pointless to discuss "what-ifs." you have won. your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.
wait, wait, wait madam faruzan's right, that style is a classic, and used to be mainstream fashion. but these days, there are some other options, too.
what are you so afraid of, honestly? we're finally about to meet the true author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." aren't you excited?
if we ever need to expand the kujou clan residence, i'll be sure to find you.
i have observed liyue from the jade chamber for years aeur" every building and every tile is etched into my memory.
the retrieval of my lifeforms isn't complete yet. there's more than just one, and some are stored in a sealed zone.
my lady, stop trying to look tough. we're already in a tavern, so let's rest up and grab some grub.
never mind. i bet you did that on purpose. tell me, spirithief, why are you hiding in the filth?
careful, there are some strange things on the wall and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe
but, if the cute forest, meadows, and little foxes hadn't started to twirl and fade away, i really might have slept for the whole day!
i hear she works for that's life magazine as well. she's young, popular, pretty
hmm when i wrote the letters, i heard that dehya was in port ormos, and alhaitham was at the akademiya.
i'm in today. but that is not an excuse for misbehavior.
we are not completely out of options.
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
i'll be at uyuu restaurant aeur" find me there when you're done. i will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
and also my mind was consumed entirely with the plight of inazuma and the fate of those closest to me.
who is this weirdo?
if it looks like a hot pot, smells like a hot pot, and acts like a hot pot i can only diagnose him as being a hot pot.
yes. when customers are done eating, they can come to the alley for a stroll.
but gorou rarely buys anything. so as a favor for me, i'd like to ask you to accompany him.
uh-huh. don't worry, i'll take care of any repercussions.
cocolia let's settle this bad blood right here, right now!
*cough* it was built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa rand, and also
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously well, at least we finally get to go through
that's where you come in. your descriptions can explain everything in full, vivid detail.
you've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the sacred sakura and makoto's consciousness. but unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
i don't have suggestions, only an opinion, and that is "he's a hopeless workaholic."
is that where i came from?
how about this: you tell me where those two people are, and i'll take the comb back to them for you. sound good?
okay. next, i will show you a secret kitsune spell. this painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means i'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
but amber said the snowman i made was too artistic apparently, the conventional style is more rotund in appearance.
so i told him about the express, and eventually he stopped crying and started asking so many questions.
close your eyes and hold your breath. sever all other sounds and let my whispers fill your ears.
we'll do it the mercenary way. i'll find leads as we go, all you have to do is just follow me.
tch, it's called being a professional. i'm a bodyguard, and i work for whoever's paying.
here's what i've drafted so far. anything else you want to add?
why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
otherwise, how could one hope to capture even one thousandth of the almighty shogun's majesty?
i sent over some evidence regarding the prison break in the shackling prison. i trust you've already looked it over.
you have mountains, and bodies of water, food and fun, and everything to like!
but before that, on the road towards the end, there are still many things that we can do.
the new jade chamber is missing many of the contents held by its predecessor.
you needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. leave them to beidou aeur" she is well versed in handling treasure hoarders. i will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
the power to grant wishes but only within the confines of the bottle.
however, just like grandpa said, those who excel with the sword will eventually suffer by it.
not only that, urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," to become the most popular in inazuma.
after who knows how long, he mastered all the knowledge he could comprehend.
come on, let's see if that guard over there will let us past.
hehe. you are the most important part of the plan. i know what i'm doing. you don't think i'd leave you with no chance to win at all, do you?
some remembered the names of the heroes who saved their kingdom, but others simply continued their lives none the wiser.
my keyboard guy is pretty good, but i still miss our military days playing in the band
she just wanted somewhere uninhabited to experiment with her "life helix system." ruan mei is certainly very talented, but she hardly interacts with anyone. she lives like a hermit. pity.
wait what are they up to?
her power was already on the decline. then you dealt her that fateful strike.
uh-huh! i let's just leave it here for a while and it'll be alright, right?
ah, i must say, i would relish the opportunity to watch the fatui getting a taste of their own medicine
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
give you a chance, huh? sounds to me like you'd rather strike some kind of a deal than spend lantern rite behind bars?
before i left inazuma, many people heard that i was looking for a meteor shower, so they told me that they wanted to make wishes.
the wind that blows from afar carries fresh life to these shores
it is. i have greatly enjoyed experiencing the adventurer lifestyle with you.
the boundless cosmos unfolded before me. i was completely mesmerized, not just by the view, but by a realization--
i'll leave the reassurance of the researchers in your hands.
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
now then, i always have my ways. it's just a question of how crafty i need to be
it would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
i say that our powerful magician, mister lyney, is now the prime suspect for the serial disappearances case.
i don't have any friends that i can be frank and honest with, so maybe she's right. you're the closest thing to friends that i have.
c'mon, just trust me on this one
perhaps the reason you do not possess a vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you it's a possibility.
you'd better rest up and regain your strength before we settle things, lessig.
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract goes against everything the nameless are about.
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
hmm, alright, maybe this will help.
you knew how important that comb was to nannan, and you exploited that fact to emotionally manipulate her.
i do trust miss march seventh's taste. actually, i just tried picking out a few designs with her, but she now seems more conflicted than i am
i could hardly happen upon vidyadhara bone marrow and test the prescription myself, could i?
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
prey will usually rest on rainy days. but not the hunter.
anyway, thanks for the suggestions! they all have something about them. i'll have to think about it
seriously? another competition? i thought we were supposed to be sightseeing. uh, but still aeur" wait for me!
don't worry, snowfall on this scale is no impediment. we can keep moving.
things are really heating up now! you can feel the contestants' passion too, can't you, alhaitham?
for example, whenever a kite blew away, people would say it was the adepti that summoned the wind to take it away as an offering. that way, you can turn an unfortunate event into an auspicious one.
those stellaron hunters they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
very good! the wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
please excuse me for a moment. i think i'll leave the gift in her abode.
i know that you're good people. you helped a lot of the injured in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies.
here. take this. it's powdered rime aeur" just add it to your snowman, and it will never melt.
look at it whenever you're feeling down. who knows, maybe it'll raise your spirits. if nothing else, you'll know that i'm supporting you all the way.
i've actually heard all about you from beidou and kazuha. i hadn't expected to find you'd joined the resistance, though.
why are you two always so quiet?
and yet -- you don't sound any different. your breaths are not prolonged, and your presence doesn't feel like it's been altered in any way
traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
you are the enemy of eternity
oh, come on, baizhu. i'm not that unreasonable.
exactly. see? you understand where i'm coming from.
but after shingo dies, you'll be next.
i prefer my current life. there's danger and there's excitement.
sounds good to me! i support your decision.
what is this? what happened to the grand sage and his entourage?
i'm sorry to interrupt your lovely little chat here, but i think there's something you may need to know.
have you still not realized your situation? from the moment you appeared, you were doomed to one fate.
the first tenryou commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. that is why the title has been passed down within the kujou clan ever since.
strange, why is there no one here?
well, given your experience and skill in that regard, i have no doubt you'll be able to overcome anything that comes your way.
as a fox envoy, i have an excellent memory. i recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
don't mention it. you'd better get going.
i'm fine, seriously. really! i
while the position of tianquan remains mine, i will always ensure liyue's safety.
seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker -- she takes decisive action. she'll definitely be able to help you. not to mention you also have bronya now.
guuji yae please tell me you are not sheltering a wanted criminal here?
his wife, lying next to him, said: "you're off to search for the dendro archon today, aren't you? have a safe journey, my love."
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already
so you made me go through all this effort to repair junjun just so you could sell him?
it's just that, because of their local customs, the native people choose not to leave.
still stable, i suppose. do you still remember the medic who saved me in battle?
is that right? kaeya also gave you some suggestions. he is an excellent knight after all aeur" this is a fact no one can deny.
i was due a visit, so i thought i'd bring you a gift. nothing too precious, just my way of saying thank you!
this is the best reason you could come up with? you think tacking on the word "family" will be enough to talk me into helping you?
because maybe it doesn't matter so much if something's real or not. maybe magic and awesomeness are what make something worth believing. why should someone else get to take that away from you?
there's no need to covet an illusory sky in dreams, because we have the right and the ability to fly towards a broader horizon.
please, share your insights with me.
the last time i saw her, she was preparing to meet someone on the snow plains. she even asked for a stove set from me
yes initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
even though it may not allow us to make the most of the surroundings my apologies.
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
an "ambition" is a yearning for something material, or a concrete outcome. it is finite in nature, and will be replaced by a new ambition in due course.
i have a feeling that with you, i can pick up the lost threads and dispel my uncertainties.
you know what? mister yang got me excited about it too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
after all, it is a grand event held by the family. the guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.
well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
arlan, i understood the level of stress you're dealing with as soon as i saw this photo.
in your opinion, what does this "deja vu" mean?
oh, what a pity. i was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
general huaiyan, the sky-faring commission has finished its preparations. do you have any other instructions?
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
okay. grab the kamera, and i'll give you a scenario.
well, the healer lady couldn't do anything about my condition. she just told me to "enjoy some tasty food."
you don't seem to have much going on right now, though, so i think i'll go ahead and snooze a while longer.
ah, i see. so in other words, i need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
as you approach, an ominous aura surrounds you. you get the sense that your enemy is close at hand.
that would suggest that zhongshan is not the murderer.
please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, uhh what comes next? oh, right! by solemnly kneeling to the ground with utmost sincerity.
it looks so much like dan heng i wonder if
since the goal here is to bond with our fungi, we should treat them as friends and create happy memories with them. eating and having fun together are vital components of "friendship training."
i may be getting ahead of myself, but for amphoreus, i am willing to take a chance on you.
by solving the puzzles, you prove yourselves worthy of inheriting the secrets of the past.
hehe. well, if you were just looking to shoot the breeze with me, i can get on board with that, too.
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
one side will play the guardians of liyue harbor. the other side will play the fatui and osial.
anyway, the next part's the records of the goods themselves. there are a lot of entries everything was probably sourced from the rainforest.
so it's a place that even lisa doesn't know?
so, i will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
send this report to the ministry of civil affairs and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
ahhhh well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
ah, now your questions are making me hungry.
but i can't just stand by and watch mister gopher wood become an enemy of the harmony. i won't use my voice to support an evil cause
and the one hundredth vision bearer in question the one who will have their vision seized, i fear is thoma.
the two nameless have been honest in their answers. even though there are some tricky details, my intuition tells me there is nothing wrong.
this must be the karma terminal. they say this terminal is designed to establish the causal relationships between objects.
come, take a seat. we can discuss my uncle's gift while we eat.
initially, my plan was to use the threat of "banishment" to test their resolve and perseverance.
if you are willing to return what is mine, i will refund all the money you spent in the auction today.
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of
well, well this is not what i was expecting
i would like to continue walking through the forest for a while. will you accompany me?
if tears were worth money, i could depend on them to become the richest person in the cosmos!
the answer is: there is no difference. the sword pierces the body and severs its life.
when windcoming day arrives, we will hold a grand toasting ceremony to welcome the anemo archon, barbatos, back home.
and on that note, i'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to a few guests of the city.
what are you, a mob boss?
yeah, they said that i could go as long as i left the goods with them. otherwise, they'd stuff me into my delivery box and toss me into the sea to drown
that's the wisdom of an adeptus. she takes good care of those around her. though she lives in seclusion, she also manages to bring everyone together.
it's been a smooth ride... almost too smooth for a heavily guarded mansion.
later on, i gradually understood that master most likely didn't know any other way to raise a child. she was a marechaussee hunter, but i never heard her bring up her own parents.
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
my take on this might surprise you.
who would be boarding the ship at this time? where are they? i'll go check it out.
we're truly sorry for what happened but this is not the end of the story, right?
i did kind of force it on you, after all. not to mention that i dragged you along with me and gave you all sorts of trouble along the way. hehe, i'd feel bad if i charged you any mora.
these kids found way more than we did fixing all those robots what an embarrassment
the eternal land, amphoreus.
as you wish. it's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
you can find an abbreviated version of the rules printed on the back of your character card. if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
hmm. well, i think it was a combination of the weight and the energy it contains.
patience, young man -- we're not far from scalegorge waterscape. the mission the general tasked you with is about to come to an end.
the phenomenon hasn't reached a lethal stage just yet, otherwise, we would have starved to death without eating for so long.
sure am. things have been in constant turmoil since i transferred to the luofu. now that i've got a little free time, i'm here to listen to some storytelling.
thanks for stepping in, general feixiao. otherwise, i'd have had to knock them out with my incense.
i never imagined that something i learned about unexpectedly would become the key to connecting everything.
she's been quite ill, and her world has turned upside down. it's been so long since she's been able to see her friend that even her memory of him has become hazy
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
if you don't say anything now, you may never have another chance!
my lady, this isn't about mora.
plus, if the dendro archon were to intervene then, it wouldn't feel like our victory was earned.
looks like we're off to a good start! moving forward, i'll definitely be trying more things like this from now on.
yep. it can be any name you like.
thank you. i must apologize for the trouble my daughter has brought you.
that's true. i'd certainly hate to see anyone else try to con you.
i'm glad that you're satisfied with the arrangements. here, take some time and get to know your surroundings.
as my trusted assistants, they are always standing guard nearby. they also perform various assignments as required.
i heard a lot of heliobi were sealed in the artisanship commission's creation furnace, but they all escaped when the furnace broke that's why my workload is the way it is
the moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of eternity. i shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
i tried to visit her, but i got turned away at the door the people there wouldn't listen to a single word i said.
yes. you've reached one of the better endings.
hmm, something tells me you just want to finish the free desserts before we break for the day
one slogan to end them all.
so, i'm going to tell the shogun the truth about all this. if nothing else, my conscience will be clear!
indulge my curiosity. what is the reason that i find you standing here before me once again?
let me answer that with a question. you claim that you were willing to pay a high price because you trusted me. but is that really the full story?
that was some impressive cloud knight spearmanship. which unit are you from?
it is my honor to work alongside you all. praise be for the anemo archon's guidance
if i'm not mistaken, the containers in the trove of verdure can be moved around using a control panel.
really? i hope you're not just saying that to reassure me. i want you to be straight with me if you have any suggestions.
okay, now move the kamera slowly.
it might not necessarily pan out, so don't get your hopes up too much. i'll need to take you two somewhere and ask someone some questions.
absolutely. we've already exhausted all our other options.
accepted. let's add that to the peace treaty. i can assure you that your vessels will be quite safe in our hands.
an inquisition spirit? on the express?
well, don't start celebrating too early now. even if i have been carrying a curse like you said, how does that prove that i am merely a human being?
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
it's a very cute room, miss march just like you.
we've only met once. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
and if i end up having to do it all over again in the future i will not hesitate to make the same decision again.
oh, really? "only" sixteen system hours? well, let me lend you a hand.
little gui, this is official business -- it's nothing like the street fights we're always dealing with. you can stop being so excited
i went back to the domain again just now. although i couldn't find a new route, it wasn't a completely fruitless trip.
i guess i still get fired up by that feeling of going all-out in a fight it made me realize that i'm still a mercenary through and through.
it's gonna come down to a fight one way or another, so let's all be careful.
we're up against the akademiya. everyone knows that they're very powerful. being skeptical might actually be the more normal response.
don't worry, i have made preparations. the wound dressings are ready and the millelith have set up an ambush.
you were a great help to folks on the space station -- my job was so much easier with you around.
mika tells me that rather than rejoining the expedition party, grand master told him to return to his post in eula's reconnaissance company after delivering the letter.
the chrysos heirs gathered here are amphoreus's only hope. people hail us as heroes, as protectors, and as deliverers
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too
the manifestation of the prophecy must have seen this. it saw lord phainon's heart wavering.
now then, my good, noble chief justice, should we not, in your view moveaeur"
we hope the residents of mondstadt and visitors from all over will enjoy the magnificent wines and experience the joy of the harvest.
it's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. but in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
you two are our guests, so please just relax and look forward to the celebration.
then in comes a bunch of outlanders in strange clothes who gawk and run around everywhere
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
north as far north as we can go.
really? i find that hard to believe
since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me ei. i'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
fireworks that disappear in a flash of light are probably the furthest thing away from the eternity that our shogun desires.
everyone thought he would be happy he survived, and he never really said anything to the contrary. but, just as i was about to put all of it behind me
i see. alright, i'll inform the police station. they'll take you into the warehouse.
that's my opinion, anyway. think about it, only people who have high standards for themselves would worry about failing to meet others' expectations.
the more time you have the more friends you lose.
this is my duty. i don't see it as an inconvenience.
thank you, everyone, for your patience. i am pleased to announce that this year's weinlesefest has officially begun.
my grandfather was a researcher of liyue's traditions. in his notes, he indicated that there was a deity called the stove god in ancient liyue which people paid tribute to at a certain time of the year.
according to tighnari, the doctor is leaving sumeru soon. i want to check if the doctor was actually telling the truth.
that's a shame, but i understand. just let me know if you ever change your mind.
the word "borisin" was only used to refer to those wolf masters. i'm a foxian who was born in one of the "fallen territories"
you've figured me out, huh? hahaha. alright, i'll quit pulling your leg.
in the other spaces, the fantastic compass was always partially buried in the ground. but this one is lying flat, intact as if somebody left it here.
haha. i was thinking the same thing. the feast will be held sooner or later, right?
of course not. whatever it is, i'm not curious, and i'm not going to ask.
i couldn't tell if she was complimenting me or mocking me. either way, i'm not about to let it go.
incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits."
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence
the only things that can stop such negative emotions are rationality and responsibility. this is a valuable lesson i've learned from mister svarog.
no need. you have your own duties to take care of. i'll be fine by myself.
yeah, i was gonna ask what was all that supposed to be?
i think i know what it will concern. even if oleg wasn't looking for me, i would've looked for him.
right answer. now's our chance to get through to her. you, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
no no no, you must be prudent with your words. calling someone a "good friend" could easily offend them.
if the books stored in this hut are anything to go by, this seems to be the place where the goddess of creation first made the townspeople of this forest.
just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
is it so unthinkable? there are many stories about fallen aeons.
it sounds much more pleasant to call an acquaintance a "dear friend." so another thing to remember aeur" aristocrats are concerned with face and being polite.
in the past, i used to have many believers coming to see me at the shrine every day, and most of them came for the same reason.
well, cyno doesn't seem to be much of a talker, either. i guess that leaves it to my "employer."
look, a solitary chain. go say hello to it.
i have much to contemplate in the days to come. but at least i can now see the way ahead.
then i'll wait for you over there. there's still some good news that i'd like share with chevreuse.
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
enough. don't use that nauseatingly fawning tone on me!
sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? all these hallways really look the same to me...
strange, is that really the lessig that i know?
i had nothing going on, so i decided to return to aaru village for a visit. i was actually looking forward to a pretty exciting time getting back together with everyone here
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
would you like a cup of tea? i can go make one for you.
rest assured, cocolia may have changed over the years but she'd never hurt bronya. i'm certain of that.
while i trust the bravery of the divine foresight and the nameless, i'm curious about some details missing from the report. i'd like to take this chance to have an exchange with both of you.
losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
i saw her leaving the other day with a nervous look on her face, it seemed like she was hiding something in her arms. did you give her something?
do you really believe those living in dreams can escape pain and find true happiness?
oh, so you must be the author of a legend of sword. i didn't expect to see others tagging along with you.
it's not only the monsters that i am worried about. i'm concerned about what else might escape from the sacred sakura.
miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
it's okay, i'm not here to see him. we just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
you guys are acting weird but okay, i'll try.
i think we should lead with a bang, dip into a slippedy-slide, then whoosh into a woop-woop! boom.
i'm good, everything seems normal
he didn't lie about the weapon being one of chartonus' handiwork, though. thanks to its inscription, i now have a fairly good guess of the time period we're in.
you're the first ten-lords commission judge i've met. what do you guys do, exactly?
with the allowance grandpa gave me, we'll be able to have a huge meal! no, three huge meals!
ah, sorry to make you two come all the way out here.
master kucha, do i count as a "ninja initiate" now?
don't worry, i haven't forgotten my promise. but first, i have to drop by the ministry of civil affairs and close this case.
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
at that time, i could sense ei's whereabouts, but i also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
i've gotta say, aetherium wars is really fun, i've been grinding for several days straight -- barely even had time to eat!
anyway. you're looking for a chance to shake my will aren't you?
bring it on. i'm ready for your challenge.
did you think this swordplay was just a game of victory and defeat, future sword champion?
an aesthetic you share, miss acheron.
i'll let sakujirou know after we get back.
i think i understand what's going on. it's not unusual to be anxious when you're far away from home. when your nerves were thrown into disarray, the sweet dreams soda you drank intensified it.
and besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce inazuma to all teyvat through light novels. as they say, it's two birds with one stone.
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
yes, but his faith and determination were conveyed to the dendro archon, so she blessed him in the form of a dream.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting
there's no time to talk about this. the wardance has already started! if my guess is correct, the borisin will most likely use the ceremony to begin their slaughter.
i've been in liyue harbor for quite a long time now, and i've witnessed many farewells along the way. so i, too, am well acquainted with the pain of the passing of a loved one.
because i don't buy it, that's why. i don't believe for one second that we're gonna find the conqueror of demons by going through that door, so i'm sure as heck not gonna be the one to get us through.
i have no clue what you two are talking about, but it's still dangerous here, soaeur"
i still think there's more to this story, though. kokuchuu must have had his own motives beyond just treating leyla's condition.
she ought to meet your "one we can properly speak with" requirement, right?
by imprisoning hoolay in the xianzhou luofu, the marshal both suppressed the dangerous intentions of the yaoqing foxians and warned the xianzhou luofu to refrain from repeating its mistake.
even though you heard we went to handle monsters together, you believed that candace was the only one doing all the real fighting.
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
whatever other motives they may have, we are at least aligned on this. so let's consider them an anonymous ally.
and where are all the soldiers we saw in the port just now?
everyone has different dreams. if we accept miss topaz's offer, then doesn't that mean our dreams will never come true?
are you leaving? this old town is too dangerous. we'll accompany you part of the way.
also, i wanted to ask you guys something. did you see a bunch of scary-looking men come by here, at all?
the liyue qixing always repay their debts. and as you have heard, our eyes see far and our reach is long.
amber and i have some business to attend to now. see you later.
but no matter how gepard and i asked and probed, lynx simply refused to tell us who she was gonna meet *sigh* i'm such a failure of a sister.
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
lemme think to be honest, he doesn't seem very interested in the extravaganza, so he probably doesn't stick around longer than he has to.
but i see through it all. and unlike them, i could never be hostile towards anyone who's never done anything wrong.
and to make things worse, another group of visitors just entered the depths of the shackling prison, the messengers from the xianzhou yaoqing.
by the way, i'm curious. if my pay is so low, then what about our two lead actors? didn't they travel here all the way from inazuma?
i've yet to experience it myself, but no one in their right mind would turn down a chance to journey through space.
i will be hosting this hearing on behalf of the sky-faring commission. mingxi, are your people all present?
to put it into short-life terms -- a funeral. you see, for long-life species of the xianzhou, death has always been a distant, mystical concept.
yeah. i've fixed a lot of things before, but i never had to repair one as complicated as this.
oh, dunyarzad! it was taking you so long that i assumed you got trapped at home, but you made it in the end!
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
hehe. oh, we have reason to put you on trial. it's obvious, isn't it?
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
wow, matsuzaka, nice work! it's not easy to beat itto
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
i'm quite familiar with dragonspine by now.
ahh, don't think anything of it! i just help out when i can because everyone else takes such good care of me.
mhm, i do see your point. but are you sure you wish to do this?
maybe he's just trying to get you two to move faster, or he just wants to provoke you given his nature, this "elite player" might even be him.
a "warp trotter" that's a pretty rare aether spirit but they were acting kind of strange in the battle -- is there something wrong with them?
hey diluc, i heard that the fatui have recently proclaimed you "persona non grata."
let's go! stay close, you two. cloud knight sushang will guarantee your safety!
neuvillette is a man of his word. if he says he can do something, then he means it.
worry not. i'm capable of handling it, trinnon.
i'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
now, it seems like she was right, while i took the wayward path.
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
what you're seeing here is one of my puppets. i'm using her to talk to you.
and, well ever since huitzilin died, i haven't wanted to form that kind of connection with people.
and just a moment ago, we caught him in a dandelion wine crate near the sailing breeze.
zubayr theater isn't simply a performance venue to us aeur" it means more than that. it's been our home for a long time.
while words can be deceiving, your gaze, your breathing, and your scent they reveal more than your words do.
the robots will have seized the road ahead by now. we should go carefully.
yo, ninja ruri! yo, silvergun shura!
however, following this duel, i have decided to postpone the kujou clan's punishment for the time being.
mm in that case, shall we continue our conversation at the shrine of sangonomiya?
the situation has changed completely. without the assistance of a judge, continuing would place all of you in grave danger -- defeating the purpose of the squad.
at the intermediate stage of my journey, or chuuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. the art of the polearm aeur" slashes and backslashes.
it is my pleasure to announce that the winner of the masterful chefs finals is:
i'm kinda hesitant to ask her to participate in a dangerous plan like this, but we can ask her in person.
i'm sorry. i wasn't there for the whole thing. by the time i arrived, the worst of the fighting was already over.
if you got any broken equipment lying around you can always come find me, though i can't guarantee i'll be interested in fixing it.
they are counting on us to vanquish the titans, reclaim their coreflames, topple them from their thrones, and take their authority for ourselves.
i bet, you were mumbling something about "stellarons" and "wishes" i couldn't make sense of it.
not now, lord mydei. i'll tell you everything once we return to okhema.
alright. then i'll mark down furina for "easy mode." all her checks will be successful by default. as usual, navia and lyney will play on "authentic mode."
presumably miss sparkle is now carefully arranging the next crime scene, right?
this purple ninja secret brew seems like it would replenish my ninja power. shatter it and replenish some ninja power.
(oh, almost forgot about that title page he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
the knights of favonius plan to use this as an opportunity to do some fundraising for needy children and elderly people in the city.
i like your analogy very much. indeed, birds are born to fly, but in a distant past, their ancestors could only gaze at the sky in envy.
i've been thinking about making a brand-new mask based on some trait. you know, switch it up a little. any recommendations?
i concur with you. ninja hiryu is a punctilious ninja indeed.
keep a cool head, or you'll expose your weaknesses.
thank you. the cozy furnishings and peaceful atmosphere on the express put me at ease.
"dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land." who knows, the wind might take it all the way to celestia.
even if the sky was gonna collapse on the divination commission, the master diviner would be there to hold it up. what she lacks in height, she more than makes up for in stamina.
by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
so the past still weighs heavily on your heart?
i'd like to see us try, haha they're extremely heavy. even with all of us, we wouldn't be able to move one.
please also deliver this message to the ministry of civil affairs.
your soul is remarkable. such a strong presence even on par with the lord of the night.
uh-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. you'd better fill me in.
no, in fact, i should say, she's hiding everything from us.
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
it's not urgent, so there is no need to leave immediately. i suggest you take a few days to familiarize yourselves with the army and also with watatsumi island.
had it been the case, then knowing how the fatui operates, they would have left some evidence of it.
miss samuel, i think you'd best turn around. it seems you're not quite familiar with the term "pawn."
the same thing applies here. at a mere glance, i can differentiate carved marks from the results of combat training.
don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the raiden shogun? that's all that light novels are supposed to be aeur" a bit of fun.
if you wish to truly achieve the dignified conduct of an aristocrat, you must learn to remain composed and elegant even amidst harsh conditions.
she wasn't looking for flowers and applause aeur" all she wanted was to see her audience smile.
phainon steers his own fate.
i'm just worried that if we don't get down to business soon, i'll take up too much of your time.
who did you hear this from? do you remember what they looked like?
you spent so much time in belobog on your last visit -- you must have passed by here before, right?
that puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins
clearly, professor capote is unlikely to master my speech or mannerisms any time soon... but the content is the key here!
as i mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." still, look at it this way: just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
there are more merchant caravans than usual traveling the route between dornman port and mondstadt city during the festival. extra traffic means extra security is required.
i was worried i might embarrass myself in front of you. i even rehearsed every word beforehand.
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future
ha! look at this. after over ten years, the teeth marks are still here.
they're getting ready to attack! those miners are unarmed.
we should be nearly at the bottom now let's wrap this up.
hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
be very careful and watch your step as you make your way through.
oh? well then i'll give you a chance. defeat me, or hand over all your swords.
hmm? wait a moment, child. you're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
isn't one of the joys of playing chess to continually learn and progress through a complex set of rules?
bighead fiendling, educators impart knowledge, cultivate skills, and clarify doubts, but they must never deny any ninja initiate of their way of the ninja!
we can and we will! i think it's great!
the intel suggests that the fatui saw him as very low risk, but zhiyi was still extremely careful with the poisoning.
the number of times that the thread trembles is the number of steps forward that the executioner will take.
well then, let's begin your training immediately. it'll be easier to train when we're back in mondstadt, we'll require other people.
um cloud retainer spends most of her days studying mechanisms in her abode. she's on her own so much of the time that the moment she has someone to chat with, she just
you can call me the memokeeper, black swan.
but it was much earlier than that.
some spiritfarers occasionally use ingenia from the artisanship commission to navigate the treacherous terrain here.
i agree with you, black swan. that's why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...
oh? what would you like to know, paimon?
initially, i thought this might just be another case of a merchant hoarding goods in hopes of maximizing their profits. but once i heard more, i realized it must be the thief you are after.
mingbo's plan is more thorough and more measured. you can tell he's meticulous in his work, very detail-oriented.
remember you are still on the luofu. try not to go too wild!
that's pretty clever. gettin' right into their heads.
take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. i'll have the alchemy commission healers see to you when they arrive.
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger.
darn, can't activate it. it seems like someone's severed the energy supply to the terminals.
but is your shop part of the future that the ipc promised?
don't worry, this is my treat.
oh, don't pressure yourselves on my account! are you rehearsing for a show?
if it were me, i'd just leave him be for a couple of days. he'll recover on his own soon enough.
power? now there's a key performance indicator i haven't needed in a long time.
however, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
it's just a few steps away -- you're not leaving with us?
a possibility to turn ororon into a vessel for loose souls.
don't be scared, durin. we'll be right by your side.
i wonder what stories have been left behind in the memory fragments that we found today?
oh? seems you haven't seen his other side
back in this office again the last time i was here was the last time i was here.
ah! so that's how it is, no wonder i haven't heard from bronya is she alright?
i've heard a lot of nice things about the lesser lord from dunyarzad. i can understand her devotion and gratitude.
they were tales of desert warriors defeating dragons in the forest, or stories of mercenaries rescuing princesses from rebel armies.
why? because the whole of liyue witnessed me destroying my jade chamber.
relax. when the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
do not merely cast your protective gaze upon the land. instead, focus your sights on our city and each of the citizens that dwell within it.
hmm you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet
but, um where are moon carver and mountain shaper?
you recognize the voice as belonging to the "guard" who led you to this place. it appears he now covets the treasure for himself, and has come to stake his claim
oh wow i can't imagine that. i'm sorry, the xianzhou yaoqing doesn't have much artificial snow.
hmm then, why don't we go back to sumeru city and ask the blacksmith?
beyond that, you really want to think about the proportional allocation of resources
given the suddenness of the situation, and the difficulty in resolving it, i authorized a greater than normal disbursement in case of unforeseen circumstances.
i don't know the details. she said she wanted to rest, and i have nothing pressing that requires her attention. so there is no reason to disturb her.
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you
i just did what i had to do. you are special, after all so special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
let's begin with your manner of speech. aristocrats have a very unique way of carrying conversation, even with mundane daily topics.
so that's how it is i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
okay, i'm sorry but sometimes when you're out on a limb, you gotta double down to seal the deal, you know?
looks like everyone's here. before we begin, why don't we finish where we left off yesterday? there was an important decision to be made, yes? i'll pour everyone a cup of tea.
i know that they don't really exist, but i still enjoy believing in them. if someone came up to me and starting telling me to "stop being so stupid, they don't exist, nyah nyah nyah"
pascal could you please, uh explain why you were stealing parts?
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
sorry, my bad but it's not too late! you can order anything you want!
then why did you still come here
oh, don't mind me aeur" i'm just a disgruntled old hag, right? come on, relax. i'm sure my bark's worse than my bite.
well, bladie? are you satisfied?
but even though we're all well-acquainted by now, i think this festive gathering deserves something ceremonious.
so you and delavar have been partners all along.
but the oratrice handed out that verdict unilaterally, and it has been operating independently ever since it was first created.
hold on, i'm coming over.
what strong names! greetings, ninja ruri and ninja hiryu!
you're gonna have to step it up, y'know. my record is six days no shut-eye.
this is your handwriting, arlan!
greetings to you both. this is one place i didn't expect to run into you two.
i have recorded all the clues you provided, mister limestein. thank you for putting your trust in the silvermane guards. we will keep you informed if there are any developments in the investigation.
that's part of it, but more importantly, i've been wondering why people link meteor showers and wishes in the first place.
may happy times always be with you.
come with me, we need to check the engine room! it's the heart of the ship, so we need to prioritize its safety!
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
well, back in the day, the first thing he did with any mora was spend it on things like drinks and meat.
if i wasn't, then why would i care about you being cold? if you turned into a paimon popsicle, that would ruin my plans for vengeance now, wouldn't it
ah, the sun is out. our work's done for the day shall we take a stroll?
now that things have settled down, i finally have time to pay the express a visit.
blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. you're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
then it's in your hands. elio didn't say anything about what happens next.
in that case, do any of you have experience in hunting?
sure, i'd be happy to do that. i don't have any more time to waste here aeur" i still have other things to do.
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them
a jade seal used by the shipwrights. it opens various passages.
without that power, it's just a normal dye. but, the color it produces is still quite rare.
no, i meant, if you're going to analyze the facts, count me in.
that would only be forcing people to watch something they don't like.
oh, she had a bunch of codenames. i heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked
they're not lying, i promise you.
there's no point in resisting, mister norbert. your accomplices have been subdued. there's nowhere to run.
so you're also saying the guards want to work with wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
mm-hmm. the object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the gnosis and the prototype puppet is now known as "the balladeer."
my original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. but then i ran into miss hu tao and mister zhongli, and well, you know the rest. i suppose it was meant to be.
divine punishment has never been fair. as okhema's guardian, i must do the same.
either. both are confidential.
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
you know what, i think her music rocks. too noisy by traditional standards, for sure, but i don't care. good music is good music. and good music should reach the widest possible audience.
hold on over there, is that
i'm sure his grace doesn't consider the fortress to be outside the law.
lucky for you, i just finished editing my stream -- it's all the proof you need
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor
(calm down, nilou first, carefully analyze what he said.)
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute
ahem. oaeur"noaeur"deaeur"ra?
knights of favonius, time is against us.
was the seer strategist thinking of us, or thinking of the fates we're destined for?
one of the problems i want to solve is tackling the heating issue without exhausting geomarrow reserves. i've discussed this with serval -- she'll be the one responsible for handling this matter in future
please excuse us, benefactors. i look forward to our meeting.
as for rahman, your guess is as good as mine. i only remember he said that he had something to discuss with cyno you can ask cyno when you meet him.
you probably think i'm being impulsive and unreasonable, right?
there may still be other treasure hoarders in the area. we should head elsewhere, just to be safe.
no, no matter how i think about it, something is definitely off. grandpa didn't tell me anything about the ceremony. he must be hiding something.
but that's still just a speculation. i don't think the master would stoop so low to make mora.
no, nothing like that. the assessment itself is complete. but let me give you a word of advice: things are not always as they appear.
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
i have my ways. i would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
she's his "family" did you really forget?
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
my real name is guinevere. guinaifen is the xianzhou name shangshang gave me. who is shangshang you ask? she's my best friend -- sushang the cloud knight. have you met her?
outworlder girl in a strange new land, came to perform and make her stand~
i get it -- you're scared. i'm scared too. i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
ahem kaedehara, about the vision hunt decree
i want to re-live that time from my life, feel some of that drive again. take a trip down memory lane.
hm, very perceptive for a mirror.
hehe, fireworks aren't just for festivals y'know.
i will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, i need you to do two things:
everyone does -- you're the hero who rescued the vidyadhara healer lady in exalting sanctum.
good. and as agreed, please use top-grade materials only.
that sounds kinda weird
after all, the master should be the one who is most aware of their student's strengths and weaknesses.
mister zubayr, we're trying to put together a list of arguments that might be useful. any ideas?
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him right?
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
however, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well
it seems the ground collapsed during our little confrontation up there. perhaps because we triggered the elemental forces
that's fine. since it's something that took place in inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
still, i'm happy to see that you approve of my culinary tastes.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
even if a child from the desert got the chance to obtain an akasha terminal, almost all their requests for knowledge would be denied. the akademiya believes we're undeserving.
if we landaus have one thing in common, it's that we're all stubborn in our own way.
this theater holds a special meaning in all of our hearts aeur" it's irreplaceable.
that's the second time you've evaded the possibility of a battle you really do want to change my prediction, don't you
that's because the marechaussee hunters of ages past would often imbue their weapons with special enchantments to suppress the monsters. whenever a monster was nearby, their weapons would start to glow.
alright. i'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you knew about my greatsword. let's make this a quick trip aeur" miss dunyarzad isn't completely safe here.
but we still don't have any weapons in hand
let's go, benefactors, time is of the essence. we must be close.
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
mm, we should be going to see wildfire. let's move.
we don't have time to talk about this right now let's set off. hopefully, this little one will help us recreate the memories of castrum kremnos.
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
of course, you don't have to accept my help. after all, "aristocrats are naturally superior and need no help from others."
*sigh*, i told you it'd take a while to tell the story -- let's get back to the workshop first. by the way wanna help me pack my bags?
approximately how many people are exhibiting these symptoms?
and one of them hasn't returned to me because she ventured too far. until now.
right, maybe someone deceived her with news about tail -- told her "she could only go alone." sounds like a trick some nasty kidnapper would use.
the five kasen plaza is significantly less crowded now, but it's still too early to relax. this is a serious matter, and we must remain vigilant. is that clear?
i heard that some stalls at the wisdom gala are debuting new games, so feel free to drop by if you're interested. otherwise, see you next round!
that's the belief of the architects but for us, hell is an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
this is bad news. i don't think sakujirou had enough time to make his mind up
to claim that i "made" her do anything would be imprecise. we reached a mutually beneficial agreement, as is always the case in our dealings.
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
yes, that's what i was talking about something strange has happened.
thank you. choose whoever you like. wildfire will take care of the rest.
hmm out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine point five!
that thought has brought me great comfort, and now i know how to speak to you properly.
but it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the inazuma of today is no longer inazuma.
thus, the current situation is that our fatui antagonist is still at large, has the two rogue commissions wrapped around their finger, and is distributing delusions from the shadows
although the theater's performances don't align with the akademiya's requests, the law doesn't say that zubayr theater can be demolished only because of that reason.
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
just some toys to amuse myself with.
but at least i have time to come visit you guys! did you miss me?
my home's located some way outside of the city, in a very quiet and peaceful area.
of course. my word is my bond. i said that i'd stand with you to the end, and i won't go back on that promise.
this whole time, you have been a great companion to me. you are always so considerate of my circumstances.
even to this day, this thrill still courses through me.
i don't believe they have mondstadt's best interests at heart.
i am herta herself, the emanator of erudition and a true-blue genius. why would i be holding the purse strings? that menial task is beneath me.
this is miss kuki shinobu, whom i've recommended to you before.
ah, i almost forgot. the ministry of civil affairs is hosting a kite-flying contest on the night of lantern rite.
as your friend, may i ask how the alliance intends to punish the general of the luofu?
before one makes a plan, what is the most important thing one must do?
ever since i was adopted by the kujou clan, you taught me the importance of loyalty from servants to their superiors
don't rush, we still have time. think about it first and ask when you're ready.
nope, i'm not about to suffer in pain. it's much easier being a coach, hehe.
it sounds like you had an eventful trip don't worry, i'm sure ganyu will fill me in on all the details shortly.
it's my sister. looks like her soul hasn't returned to the hall of karma yet.
perhaps the next time we meet, i'll be able to see you in the true sense of the word.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
it's been thirty years since we last saw each other, right, yukong?
all i know is that whenever i start chatting with people, my hands would get more and more full until i can't hold everything anymore. this seems to happen every time
only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. only if you are strong enough can i deliver you to the right destination.
haha, maybe it does, but i knew what i was getting into from the moment i agreed to help him.
thirty years ago, i fought in a terrible war. my comrade and i set sail together, but only i returned.
you're that excited to hear about my fight with the vishap?
it's not so bad at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
look, it's the invoice for the transaction between second life and fanmu carpenter's. we've brought it back.
yeah, you need to be stronger than an ox to take life by the horns.
all basic skills required by competent adventurers, if i'm not mistaken.
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason
hold on, traveler. there's something else we need to discuss.
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details well that's reassuring.
it woke up to discover that the whole place had been abandoned. so, it decided to collect parts, repair the town, and wait for everyone to return
but, there is a place we could check aeur" ochkanatlan, the ruins we now refer to as "cinder city."
things are quiet in watatsumi island at the moment, and i wanted to buy some books. so, i decided to make the trip here.

my body has fully recovered, and the shogun's will no longer fights against me.
it's a pretty solid story overall. i thought it was just an ordinary adventure at first, but the further we got into it, the more impressed i became with the production and the plot.

hey! how have your travels been? thanks to you, things are pretty peaceful around here. the chief and i are getting restless!

her opponent is skilled in the art of deception. even if she appears to have worry written all over her face, don't fall for it. she's likely trying to lead you into her trap.

if there's any other way i can help you, i'll do my best! but this
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
i admit i'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. but this is also a safe place.
foreboding signs can also be superficial. you may have good fortune after riding out the storm.
where am i going to find another genius as mentally well-adjusted as me? in the mirror?
as you begin to survey the man's condition, you're immediately able to see past the crude dressing on his leg and assess the inside of his wound.

mister xiao, why not try working with us? mingxi is pushing for reforms within the guild. we're nothing like the president.

urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
alright, it's getting late. let's talk once we're home.
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
hold on, any minute now.
isn't he the true antagonist? the one who sought nothing but his own gain and used the people as pawns to attain it in your heart of hearts, he was the one you truly wanted to defeat.
that's why there was a flaw in your dream. in other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
welcome back. did everything go well?
even though i am utterly unlike makoto, and can never become the person she was, i still need to do the things that she would have done.
it was nothing. anyone with a good head on their shoulders knows that skill and strategy ultimately determine the winner. in any case, it was an exciting match to watch.
it's a long story
let's get something to eat while we walk.
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
i smelled the scent of anxiety on you, so i used the zhuming's sleeping powder and flame ambergris, mixed with sunset cinders, to make an incense called "forget all worries." let me share some with you.
mm-hmm. catching up with an old friend i hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.

huh? don't move. there's something here.
"perhaps her answer lies in her silence, an unspoken vow left to echo through the night. the path she walks needs no explanation."
not much, but i didn't bring my coin purse.
mm-hmm, pretty accurate nickname, right? that guy has a lot on his plate -- it's enough to make you worry.
but things are a little different with these particular informants. mora doesn't get you very far with this crowd
it'll be of more use here, where it can protect this bottle domain, and the dreams of all who journey through here.
then please, master diviner, witness my destiny.
you say that but do i see your ears saying otherwise?
jepella brotherhood... i've heard that name somewhere...
good idea, why don't you take a look around, benefactors? my feet need a rest.
this old man's words always catch me off guard.
that sounds like both buttons can do the exact same thing?
i doubt it. the way she went about things often made her seem childish more than anything. i'd say the sword was most likely an heirloom passed down over time.
gotcha, thanks so much. we'll be on our way.
i think the guards must have done this intentionally.
wait a second did you say "gnosis"?
i just heard that there was a flood. but given everything that's going on, i think it likely had to do with the border as well. that would at least explain the strange weather going on at wuwang hill.
to me, this work is highly sensitive and of utmost importance, though i'm sure you will find it to be mundane at best. it would not surprise me if you can't bear the tedium or can't make the time
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
i am saying nothing of the sort, just raising a doubt, that's all. please be careful, benefactors
what i saw surprised me a good number of the architects in belobog believe that qlipoth is the one and only aeon it's clear that their conclusion was limited and lacking in perspective.
but it just didn't work aeur" i was grief-stricken, like a huge part of my heart was suddenly missing
since i'm returning to the xianzhou, i think it's better to choose something unrelated to the alliance. feel free to pick a few for me.
and look at these! how unusual they don't appear to have been left by a human
there's no point questioning or suspecting me. you're the iudex, but you're still my subordinate aeur" you should be following my lead.
huh? but there's no need for you to get caught up in this mess, too.
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
once you're reflected in my mirrors
i won't have any of this nonsense in front of the knights of favonius.
sounds like you're starting to get familiar with the area.
now i understand, the ipc has many faces.
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions
well, well, looks like someone's finally seeing sense.
that memory zone meme, it is here as well.
so we clearly didn't order this, yet you prepared it without authorization hmph! mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
oh, that sounds like a good idea. if i recall, both you and sucrose are pretty good players, right?
you and paimon are more than welcome to keep attending our shows.
hah. should i respect the shallow sense of time and condescension to mortals that has caused them to delay in moving against us qixing?
but if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then i hope its existence proves to be real.
we youkai are not like humans. humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
perhaps it's just my wishful thinking, but i think she did this deliberately, as her way of keeping our friendship eternal.
since my physical form is here in this realm, i suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.
i have already completed five sets of bow exercises. if you are up to it, i would not mind accompanying you for another five.
the reason you don't remember is that i wiped your memory before the operation at herta space station.
rosaria told me that the abyss order is going after boreas.
i know, i'm sorry! just give me some more time, and i promise i'll plan the best trip ever for you.
ei, you're thinking about this all so conscientiously. i've only got as far as wondering whether i'll be able to sell entrance tickets to the grand narukami shrine in the future.
the atmosphere around here's not too bad nowadays, so i don't mind sticking around once in a while.
mhm. "father" is very capable, and also trustworthy.
i don't want to make things difficult for official dahao. let's do this his way and prove my innocence.
i'm sorry, i'm not ready to talk to anyone about the reasons behind my decision i hope you can understand.
after residing here for a while, i've grown more accustomed to the scenery and my mind has gradually come to be at peace.
it would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
the skit this time is a modernist one.
seeing your serious expression, the man's brow begins to furrow.
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
heh you think i was joking around, huh?
no, there's nothing funny about that and you know what? it's not a bad thing to care when other people are looking.
like those fish that shimmer like a sword blade whoosh! oh, and those big fish that call when they see people "woooo"!
takatsukasa another familiar name. they have been faithfully serving the kujou clan all these years?
you need the encryption key, right? which captain should i bother then?
waeur"wait, it's not going to suddenly start moving, right?
we have such a good relationship, so surely you won't mind?
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
it has a charm that i can't quite put my finger on. i think i'm slowly beginning to understand what drives adventurers to go in search of unknown places.
stellarons, huh? ask away, i'm listening.
wow, this would be the perfect location for shooting a film.
she rarely talks about her family. all i know is that she didn't get along with them.
half an amber era ago, the family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that everyone on the planet became part of the family.
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
nononono, i wasn't doubting her ability i just feel like we shouldn't bother her with such a trivial problem.
but i've never seen any of the previous directors there, not even once.
alright then. i believe myself to be relatively well-read, but with stories like these, i don't even know where to start
but i digress. if the astral express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine
since you came all the way to watatsumi island, you might as well rest for a moment before you return.
glowswather you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
(everyone is free to appreciate art aeur" no form of art is inherently superior.)
if we wanted to kill the prey in one strike, we would need a powerful implement. however, that also goes for prey that must be captured and safely contained.
heh, you truly have changed. i suppose this is what humans call "growth."
you must be one of the three goddesses of this world are you the goddess of creation?
of course, i know! well, i know a little. my mum made me practice with swords all day -- i didn't really go to school
first, you use thin strips of bamboo to construct the frame, then you draw a design of your choice on a piece of paper, paste it onto the frame, and tie on the string

at some point, a rumor began to go around that there is great treasure buried beneath qingxu pool.
it doesn't seem like there's any information to be gained from the area up ahead. you conclude that this area is best left unexplored at this time.
the stadium could always use more manpower, so you should join the forces here.
paimon looks like she doesn't want to, so i'll carry a little extra. hehe, although i may not appear super strong at first glance, i actually do a lot of strength training on the regular.
thank you for your help, general. let's get going!
hmph, well i'm gonna make sure i don't owe the guards any favors when this is done!
when i took this job, i had already decided that i'd quit as soon as you recovered. it's time for me to get back out there and chase that horizon.
all letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? as long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded
please don't worry, we're just here to conduct a simple survey.
moving containers, picking locks seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
i know! how about a red horned lizard? it's a solitary creature and doesn't require much interaction.
am i to take it that the safety of the people of inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
to escape with their lives, the villagers would abandon their homes and flee overnight, taking only their most valuable belongings with them. everything else was left behind.

doesn't sound very interesting.
even without opening it, you can tell from the mora and jewels scattered around the chest that it must contain quite the fortune.
i've been in liyue harbor for so long now that i'm just not as familiar with the adepti anymore. if there's anything we want to know about them, she's the best person to ask.
they could have just as easily bought goods such as food and medicine directly from caravan ribat or port ormos.
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
since you agreed, i'll take you at your word!
and wouldn't that be more fun, too? better to show you the real exalting sanctum and introduce you to a true xianzhou pastime: celestial jade. aha
as a netherworld dweller, i've already died once.
to put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. to put it more bluntly, there are things that even the seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
i didn't intend to keep his sword. i was planning to take this chance to return it to him, but now i've changed my mind.
workshop? oh, do you mean the tempering workshop in rivet town?
his being yet again demonstrates that there are those who, despite being offered countless choices, will always choose the same path.
well, i'd better carry on here, why not have a better look around? my workshop will always be open to you and your wallets, of course.
oh, i see. that'll be the fishing boats coming back from the open ocean. how much cargo were they carrying? remember, i taught you how you can tell.
you asked if i view general jing yuan as my enemy no, my real enemy has always been myself.
it was only after i grew up that i realized the wall of samiel isn't just there to keep out the sandstorms. it serves a more important purpose aeur" keeping out people like us.
it appears that the millelith managed to get the captured treasure hoarder to talk.
looks like the tuskpir not only regenerates rationality, it also destroys it. now that'd make for an interesting research topic.
our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. see you later.
so aggressive. are all the robots in the settlement like this?
no, i'm nobody's attendant.
you're probably right. i know my lady's personality, and she wouldn't deliberately keep something like this from us.
that person will then pack the caravan full of necessary goods, which will then be brought right back to dakan al-ahmar
i know that he might be dangerous but he saved iwao, and the kids all warmed up to him right away. he even happily agreed to help us find the great mujina youkai.
a chance combination. hmm, interesting. may i try this drink?
i hope you have a good time in pier point as well.
that part is true. i'm always calculating when it comes to business, but never with people.
that drink has a fair amount of memoria in it, intended to make dreams more vivid and pleasant, but instead it caused your anxiety to be amplified, eventually triggering serious hallucinations.
march, before the wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
but upon his return, in cruel avarice, lyney desired sole credit and prepared to do away with his partner-in-crime.
that's why, during this golden soiree she is the dance's centerpiece.
there are even some extremists who go around shouting slogans like "retake sumeru for king deshret!" word is that more and more are joining their movement. they're becoming a real headache for chief and the others.
i figured that i needed to venture farther than usual to really broaden my horizons.
considering the gravity of our endeavor, we can't allow a little thief to spoil the show.
okay, i think we have a few potential suspects.
no matter, it'll just require a bit more work to get through.
yes. it is also my first time here. this may not sound fair to klee, but my primary duty is to protect everyone. finding this overlord is secondary.
as for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? if the ipc tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!
i gave him a second chance -- does that not count?
when i brought padisarah to life just now, i was able to sense the magic flowing through the forest aeur" in the flowers and trees, and inside the creatures that live here
though it may be said that it is in a child's nature to play, the things klee plays with are far from toys. i can never take my eye off her.
whatever the case, i think i know what everyone is getting at. i'll do my best to improve.
no doubt. i figured that out back in the underworld.
no loss can ever be undone, but there is always much that can still be gained.
"the person present who shouldn't be" who could that be?
ah, i have a feeling that our adaption will be even better than the original story!
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
your companionship this is one change that i shall not contest.
my family has pretty good connections with the yashiro commission. we work very closely with them. and whenever there's a national event of any sort, the other two commissions come to us, too.
i'm already very happy that i get to visit your express like this once in a while.
you know i think i've come to realize that i'm lacking a certain fun side?
that's why there's no need to stress over the freebies. all of us repay others by helping them when they need it.
did you at any moment think about what i would feel if something happened to you?
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
so, are you both ready?
in other words, fireworks symbolize the past.
oh so that's your story
pretty clear, although you seem to have changed the order in the jarilo case.
dan heng, could you please find the incense burner? the incense smells wrong.
i'm really worried about the future of penacony
well, i was sure worried about her after she disappeared, pela's workload doubled -- she said she barely had time to go out.
last but not least, zhiyi. his manifesto is full of pertinent details, his methodology is sound, and his proposals cover a broad range of fields, which is quite a rare feat.
passing the technique on to someone means sharing your memories with them. you need to leave traces of your color in their memory, and they must do the same.
hey, why are you sitting on the ground? are you okay?
wildfire i don't know anything about them. in all my time above ground, i never heard of this organization.
hm, true. let me check a few bottles.
if you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask asta. if she's fine with it, i have no complaints.
it's called professionalism, alright?
okay, i won't beat around the bush. oh, and i'm sorry for interrupting your rest. i'll treat you to some charcoal grilled steak to make up for it.
for certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. but i managed to bring her a garment.
in the end, the first sage took care of many disasters in sumeru city and founded the akademiya. what a happy ending!
you sound very sure of yourself. looks like you've already convinced that chicken wing boy from the family.
this is the only way i can ensure everyone's safety...
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
yet here you are saying you want to "put an end" to one of the four winds of mondstadt?
the hint for the final question was a little too obvious.
my brain must be filling in the blanks probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
and the "utterly absurd module" has also been disabled? something's definitely wrong here. i checked a couple days ago to make sure every puppet has it switched on
but in hindsight, there were still flaws with our plan.
"greedy spirit, greedy spirit, you made the moon run a ring"
i've been great, of course. every day is a happy one.
i finished all my assignments early today. oaeur"overtime? i understand. i'll get right on the case.
my name is ganyu. this is shenhe, and this is yaoyao.
simply put, there will always be work to do.
oh, nothing. it's just i sensed a very powerful magical signature just now
after some system hours, the words will turn into a common language that everyone can understand.
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
luka should tell her to go back to town -- he's always worrying after the kids' safety.
oh! sorry, i spaced out whatever works for you.
huh? this paint job and these custom parts. and the way the parts are attached it's all quite strange.
yep, the same paper slips as the ones i gave to the kids earlier. whenever a customer orders fireworks for a commemorative event, we always include a little paper slip with the goods.
perfect, then we'll leave it as-is. i'll go make an official copy.
in her eyes, the most precious things in this world were dreams aeur" the yearning for a better future held by living beings.
you probably still can! want to give it a try?
hand over hoolay's remains to the xianzhou yaoqing, and i'll handle the explanations to the alliance.
i don't think that's a monster mister svarog's database has information about it. it's called hmm, i can't remember.
hmm do we really need this one?
perhaps, but we must investigate the buoys regardless.
if possible, please inform the general and arrange for me to meet with the marshal. maybe this body of mine can help the alliance get one step closer to the xianzhou's enemies.
but it turned out you had come to rescue me you came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
so enjoy your life while you can, and when your duty to the living is over, you can meet whoever you want again in the afterlife. isn't that great?
the food was specially prepared for you by everyone in the grand bazaar, and we have gifts that were sent by the residents of sumeru city when they heard we were holding a feast.
i guess that's why everyone wants me to get more rest and relaxation apologies.
but we also don't tend to take many things too seriously. being direct and getting it all out of your system as soon as things come up is better than keeping everything bottled up and never talking about it.
by personal request of the committee, a discussion session will be added to allow all participants to raise and answer questions.
hello, traveler. i'm surprised you still remember my name.
yes, i was going to ask you to introduce me to the adepti. i thought that it would be fitting to send them some festive gifts on behalf of the liyue qixing.
exactly. we'll only be able to help them once we've seen our own mission through.
after we arrived on the xianzhou, the mara in him flared up so violently that even my spirit whisper couldn't suppress it. he's not fit for interstellar travel in this state.
that lasted up until around twenty or thirty years ago, when strange things started happening. people started speaking of an enormous, dark creature the size of a mountain roaming inside the mare jivari
alright, let's each take a road and herd those scattered guards back into one place. make sure to attract their attention. isak will be the key.
sword practice requires precise movements. this outfit is tailored to fit perfectly and allows for smooth movements. i even added some small accessories. i put a lot of thought into it.
i've got something to tell ya. my lady knows you're looking for ways to meet lesser lord kusanali, and she's been trying to come up with a way to help you. well, i have an idea that might help.
i hope that when we meet again, we can continue these sit-down discussions settling our differences on the battlefield is rather taxing.
this light cone... is securely guarded. it must hold some important memories.
sure. thankfully, i'm off the clock right now.
yes, i have heard. seeing four leave, yet only three return, was enough for me to know that fu xuan's report was indeed correct.
ah, but back to your question i really like the way you've decorated this place. it's so snug and cozy.
the heavenly principles irrelevant nonsense as far as i am concerned.
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
yes, just stand there and the computer will read your brainwaves, then automatically generate an immersive simulated experience
please leave pascal to me. it was my decision to keep him in the first place, so i must take full responsibility.
i hope so. let's go to fanmu carpenter's. it should be near qingce village.
so i've been running a fool's errand this whole time.
the training's not over yet. the part prepared by cloud retainer is only the first trial.
come on, let's go to the restricted zone. if we can get ahead of the curve and find the stellaron, cocolia will be out of options.
haha, what can we do? the lawrence name is already a dirty word among every household in mondstadt. even three-year-olds know the story. i see this kind of attitude all the time.
huh, chatting with you seems to have lightened my mood. it seems like talking can really raise one's spirits.
i don't believe anybody could be more committed to bringing this story to life on the stage than they are now.
sushang's gonna use her head? now we're really done for
i'll stay outside and provide what stability i can. i'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
thank you, master. this is my greatest honor.
why don't you and mister dan heng tour our "holy city"? see how our people make ends meet in this difficult time. i will have your welcome gifts ready later today.
my lady, please prepare yourself for what we're going to tell you next. it concerns the master
correct. scouts use up an enormous amount of energy in a single day. each meal, they eat enough to feed, hmm fouraeur"five normal people.
as a merchant, staying well-informed is crucial. it's only natural for me to stay updated on the events of the luofu before i return.
if the shogun rather than i were to discover them yes, perhaps she would have left the situation alone.
in my recently issued post-war temporary decree, i included restrictions on the prices of essential everyday goods. these items will ultimately reach the people at a reasonable price.
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
i disagree. each new day and each new year is different from those that have come before. how long will you simply let them pass you by?
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
lingsha, as always, you're still an expert in making unpaid work sound so noble and grand
y'know i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request
by the way, there's one more thing.
you've got style with those moves, but you're not striking where it counts. it's such a shame to see you misuse your sword like that.
true but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
i'm good, i'm good! i'm still a youkai, after all. i turned them over to the gardes. it just took me a while to round them all up
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
now that you are vanquished at our feet, allow me to recite to you the ninja mantra--
i just hope the monster didn't get to them.
i'm going into town to check the progress of the fireworks setup. i'll return shortly.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this
that's right. even at this price, there is no shortage of people willing to pay for a lunch opportunity with me.
life is short, and i'm happy i got to be a part of that operation.
it's my job to keep tabs on people.
hey march! don't forget to take a picture of the stellaron for me.
no harm done. what brings you to the tenryou commission headquarters all of a sudden? is there trouble afoot?
never finished it, huh?
a dog? you can determine their mood just by looking at their wagging tail, right?
hey thanks for your concern. you should head back to the town, and i'll do the same when oleg and i are finished.
i'm afraid i'm unable to share any wine recommendations with you. but i can recommend a few lesser-known restaurants that are well worth a visit.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
then your help is greatly appreciated. the abyss order's sudden offensive is very strange, they have surrounded wolvendom. i am preparing to send out some knights to fight back.
leave your contact details with me. when i've completed my assessment of the pharmacology, i'll get in touch with you.
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
i won't go into details, my lady, but they've been involved in a lot of violent incidents. we're talking hundreds.
i didn't find any components, but i got this i don't know if we can still eat it
please don't misunderstand. when you helped okhema, you already showed ample goodwill. it's just that i
i'll just assume that's a compliment! maybe next time, you could just say "silver-tongued."
please, call me lan yan. and i'm no "master craftswoman," just a humble maker of handicrafts.
oh wow, we seem to be crossing paths a lot lately where could i have seen you before? can you figure it out?
ah! paeur"please, no, don't do that to me
thanks to him, i'm able to make time for the people. i do my best to make sure that they have everything they need at the same time, i was formulating a plan to deal with svarog.
sure. you can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.
she had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
if breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. we've long been aware of a potential solution.
norbert probably didn't believe any of that nonsense -- i think he just wanted to prove himself and add more to his fortune.
traveler, have you decided on your wish?
ah, you've arrived. i've made all the necessary preparations and even packed some handmade snacks.
so that's why the war has been going unusually well but risky secret weapons are not the answer. we must put a stop to it immediately.
honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. you just gave me an excuse to bring everything forward.
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
what!? no! no, no, no -- can't you see i'm just short of hands here?
i wouldn't be surprised if there are the silvermane guards have a lot to make amends for down here.
and i thought i have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, mister zhongli.
but i'm not very strong physically. are you referring to my quick wits?
when your heart is set on something, you get closer to your goal with each passing day.
my orders are to arrest you. it is for the adjudication panel to present you with the nature and penalty of your alleged crimes.
fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in liyue.
she is indeed reckless, but she is also passionate and eager. don't underestimate her. youth can accomplish a lot simply by relying on such energy.
if we had a little more time, i could have even convinced her i was xipe the harmony.
when i stand aboard the express, i can feel that you and i are really the same -- manifesting our own futures in this universe to the best of our abilities.
gepard, can you lend your dear sister a hand? help me pack my bags~
thanks for telling me everything. i didn't think things would get so out of hand
i could tell something was off the moment i stepped into this cave, so i kept an eye out. i've already dismantled the whole thing.
if it can, then it truly is a blessing bestowed upon us by lord barbatos.
what you said back there did you really mean it?
living in the underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. i'd rather trek through the frigid snow plains than live in a beautiful cage.
once a soul becomes lost, it can never return to the night kingdom. lost souls can only wander listlessly, gradually fading from existence before disappearing entirely.
you look stunning. you should be flaunting this look at every opportunity.
whatever your reasons are, you're planning to take the cursed sword away from the xianzhou! hand it over to me!
so, are they smugglers? what exactly are they up to?
that's right -- you were just a victim of the heliobus's trickery, diviner fu -- no need to blame yourself.
if those two approve of bronya, then everyone following wildfire won't question her either.
the akademiya has never liked us, and they've never respected our work. to them, what we do is all a waste of time.
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
oh, yes, but i thought we'd meet at the jade chamber. why have you come here?
this is only the first step in making a greeting. after addressing one another, you then exchange courtesies.
this is a long shot, but it may be our last chance so, whose wish was it that summoned this device?
all existing fragmentums are connected, so there will be monsters that will enter the space station through its fragmentum.
wait! there's something we need to ask you.
general, did you hear about miss tingyun?
sakujirou and keisuke can't turn back the clock in their relationship, but that's no reason to live with remorse.
you're here. i've just finished re-inscribing the seal on huohuo's tail. next, it's time to address the matter of cirrus.
yet, i cannot jeopardize all of your lives in one single battle.
so you are the only one here? hm i thought i might get to meet your grand strategist.
since the war is now over, i propose that we have the yashiro commission appoint a business council to oversee trade between our two islands.
but one thing is for certain this little fella is not under remote control. he's operating entirely of his own accord
i recognize that woman -- that's elaine from first mining team! quick, let's get up there and see if she's wounded.
but as acting grand master i obviously cannot make such a statement publicly.
before we do anything else, let's head back to liyue harbor. i need to fetch something.
heh, the most famous restaurant in town. natasha would bring the kids who behaved well here for a special meal.
i see though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
the way up from here leads to a bath that the council granted exclusively to the chrysos heirs. the bath is strictly off limits to anyone other than the heirs.
*sigh* i understand. well, this photo will always be close to my heart. i'll make a copy for you too, clara.
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
like, "let me send over 'tarou the goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
be on your way, now. oh, and take care of yourselves, too. granny itztli will display her dashing self on the competition grounds soon enough.
then next time i'm back in belobog i'll tell them i boarded the express, and i'm sure they'll give me a hundred different explanations of how it happened
it seems like you've met a lot of people who don't tell you the whole story.
things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.
bennett, weren't you feeling dizzy too? stop pushing yourselves, both of you. get some rest, we'll continue when you've gathered your energy.
hmph, parasite of the remembrance. do you truly think your atrocious disguise can outwit the keen sight of a genius like myself?
this dream is becoming more and more separated from reality.
but he did invite you to tea, didn't he?
for as long as i can remember, my days have been an endless cycle of studying, etiquette lessons, and training.
i know you've always perceived there was something special about the sacred sakura. but to me, it has always been there.
you look up and see a tavern nearby. it appears to be open for the day.
the suanni that gaming and shuyu made looks very majestic. i'm sure it'll look even more impressive as it soars through the sky.
the protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. sounds interesting. approved!
you remember that norbert guy we captured? the silvermane guards have acquired new intel from him -- i thought you might find it interesting.
the things we believed and the experiences we had when we were young turn into our priceless treasures as we grow up.
what a shame. you're only a step away from completing the mission assigned to you
where's the records room? answer me.
this should be the place. let's find a spot to hide and bide our time.
now, time for a change of pace. where should we go?
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
how about a divination?
according to the ministry of civil affairs, the number of guards on patrol has to be doubled and rotated continuously during lantern rite.
after leaving inazuma, hmm i think it would be easiest for you to go to sumeru.
they won the archon war together, and when baal established the shogunate, beelzebul became her kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." in other words, she acted as baal's body double.
what she said was this aeur" "make sure to get along, you two. if you really can't agree on something, just settle it with a fight. whoever loses is the real pet."
oh yeah? well, since you think it's so easy, you can sign them for me.
hmm. narrative devices are truly mysterious things.
i invited you out for some simple fun and games i should have known you'd be like this.
here we are again. what kind of song are you in the mood for now?
ms. rekhar and miss najia made and assembled the centerpiece.
hehe, i suppose so. once they're done writing the manuscript, i'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
in this universe, there exist countless worlds that are similar yet different, and countless people who are alike yet distinct.
they were tough times. but i had a clear goal and plenty of motivation.
thank you. we'll be a lot stronger together with you.
come on, first thing off the top of your head. how would you spend it?
but i can't abandon my brother and the other guards -- i'm a landau! it's up to you now, i believe in you. you've given me new hope!
i say "gift," but it's more like bits and pieces the kids cobbled together. still, i hope you like it.
"observes the potential of the temporal plane." they say this terminal is designed to retrieve information related to time.
after their coming of age ceremonies, a lot of them aspired to join the ipc to make it big.
pops, are you alright? they didn't do anything to you, did they?
but through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
navia can also use firearms, but unfortunately, her style is quite different from that of the characters in the story.
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within the stellaron.
does your greed matter more to you than your fear? more to the point, if you can play a tune from memory, don't you think you should be capable of making an honest living?
okay, the stage is yours~
a cat? how could i tell whether it's in a good or bad mood?
now, kamisato ayato and the yashiro commission are neutral parties, so i have no right to give orders to the shuumatsuban.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
the trust that these four fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the wisdom orb.
look upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. phase through that corridor, and be careful -- do not alert the meme.
so. from what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
a long time ago, i also spent some time studying at paperfold university. so, i can be considered an alumnus of the school.
he also installed a secret compartment in the wine pot he bought to hold the poison. as the amount of liquor went down, he'd shake the pot to release the poison from the compartment into the liquor.
oh, but could i rent a room to use as a command post? i need a place to lay out my maps and battle scenarios.
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
it was after the components landed where they did that their owners and the things associated with them arose around them to form the different zones.
uh? he didn't send you all here?
don't worry. we weren't discussing anything confidential.
just bring kusayla to me! there's no use hiding him anymore!
that's alright. take your time to contemplate this moment. once you feel ready, let's step onto the final stage.
i didn't think many people liked that one seems the city might have a few nice memories of me after i'm gone.
i have never missed fontaine so much in all my life.
even among the fools i know, miss sparkle's sense of humor stands out from the rest.
knowing that it has your seal of approval makes me feel much more self-confident.
yes. with some exceptions, but that is more or less correct.
the tuskpir is a creature that subsists on memoria. hugging it while you fall asleep can raise your sleep quality, treat insomnia, and relieve anxiety and depression.
and by the way, since we'll be filming "the two musketeers", we'll need to find an action choreographer ideally, a professional who has actual experience with muskets.
which is precisely why i've decided to revive the irodori festival by
that place is full of untold dangers and mysteries. over the centuries, the finest adventurers have tried to prove themselves by venturing in sadly, most ended up perishing there.
i took you to the "border" and let you have a look around, didn't i? but based on your reaction, it seems like you didn't find what you're looking for. it's a pity, indeed.
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side maybe even the same person.
take a look around and you'll see what i mean. this criminal is clearly well-versed both in using music to commit crimes and in making a clean getaway.
i will, i will! haha, you're as earnest as ever.
with some suspicion, the captain allows you to survey his condition after you announce yourself as a trained doctor.
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person
thank you for your words of comfort. you make a very good point.
unsheathe your swords and show me what you've got, march!
that sounds like a great outlook on life. you have a very optimistic spirit.
and then the dream started to twirl and fade away. then, i woke up.
only a deep commitment to his ambition to become the best made it possible for him to rise above the pain of these encounters aeur" to focus on the way ahead.
that's okay. these components are really common. maybe we can find a spare one in the ruins around here.
alright, that's enough small talk. i've got things to do, seriously
so, two chrysos heirs are willing to vouch for you. hah it seems my actions were too high-handed.
yeah, i'm up for that! and if i kick your butt, you'll drop out of the wardance. deal?
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
that's easy for my grandfather to say, but this mission doesn't seem so simple anymore.
still, you needn't worry. he won't escape. you'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
if all he wants to do is steer clear of me, then maybe he shouldn't have brought me into this world in the first place.
am i really that important to someone? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories
well, i didn't, but i wanted to do something memorable with you, so i got my friends at the grand bazaar to help me learn in secret.
but lemme make something very clear: i'm only doing this because i respect your determination, not because i agree with you.
hey, you came. that was fast.
yeah, you're right. it's just a pity that we often only recognize our true feelings after it's already too late.
i know that wildfire wants to talk to mister svarog but no matter how many times you talk to him, mister svarog won't change his mind
every so often, you see him glance toward a particular direction with a pained expression on his face, as if an invisible thread is tying him to an unknown place.
no, i believe that our archon never rejected the arts. even the goddess of flowers dedicated a dance to her
but when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
good morning? you mean you only just got out of bed? this is already quite late by my standards. i typically rise well before daybreak.
also i should probably ask do you really think we'll be able to pay back everything owed on the dock?
look who we have here? a lovely young lady.
even for someone with illuminated beast blood in their veins, working for such an extended period without a break will take its toll on your health.
the disciples of sanctus medicus were in hiding for so long now they finally show their face. did the master diviner fail to foresee this?
let me guess, you're someone who doesn't follow the rules, enjoys improvising, and can handle yourself well against tough foes. am i right?
i haven't seen him for a while i hope he's grown up a bit since then.
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
ultimately, this little trotter is your companion, and now they're a part of your journey.
traveler, paimon, you are just in time.
i was wondering is the train accepting new passengers?
hi there. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
you've been running so many errands lately -- i'd like for you to take some useful items away with you.
my parents are both famous on the yaoqing! i wouldn't be here otherwise. they've been training me ever since i was born!
mmm, what is it then my answer is "bugs." is that right?
looks like we're not the only ones who wanted afternoon tea today though. we'll have to stand up for the time being.
i haven't seen oleg. the miners said they saw him take a group further in.
ah yes, i remember the invitation. i need to make sure i'm well-prepared for this.
but seriously though, i always wondered if you had some personal motives behind it.
ororon? well he was left at the side of the road as an infant and the people of the tribe took him in. you could say that everyone had a hand in raising him.
huh, their pace has increased normally, people carrying a heavy load slow down as their journey goes on and they start to tire.
just pointing out the facts. mister yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than i do.
as inazuma's god, it is high time i honored their wishes.
that's right, it would be impossible for a human
haha i fear that peeking would have been a little difficult from this altitude.
is there anyone else following us besides you?
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
uh, this is
any of that sound strange to you?
and it's suspicious how they suddenly finished their "overhaul" and walked away as soon as they laid eyes on us.
well, ipc staff are free to come and go, as long as they don't break any laws.
according to legend, the sabzeruz festival was originally the goddess of flowers' birthday celebration for the greater lord.
well then, it would seem that everything is in place. let's go and meet our old friend.
i see. it's not uncommon for merchants to be blinded by greed.
oh any idea when she'll be back?
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
ah, hello little ones. i take it you have received my commission, hmm?
so the three of them teamed up to kill her?
now i've got one of my items back, let me show you what makes it so special.
hah, you guys sure have a lot to say about that broken heater.
may i have this page to record and draw?
so he can forget about it for now!
okay, then i'll tell you two about how this holiday came to be
don't worry, they've been through worse. everything's going to be fine!
i will never forget you, and all that you did for inazuma.
but do you have any books on the topic?
i am me. there is only one of me, but i can exist in many different forms. it's not important what form i exist in.
i was a little apprehensive actually, i was wondering how i could convince you if you refused at first
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
no clue, but i know one thing
grand master varka is the legend of his generation. on the day of his triumphant return, i shall be sure to personally introduce you to him. i'm sure you too will be in awe of his greatness.
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
of course, if you have any genuine grievances about the auction, the lots, or the process, please enlighten me as to where exactly i went wrong.
you are quite the swordmaster, young man.
so it's the power of the aeon? i see
gods above, you're not talking about work, are you
today's training ends here. the qualifiers should be over now. we should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
sorry huohuo, i didn't think it through. you were never a burden.
upon ingesting the brumedew concentrate pellet, you will feel the limitless freedom of the form bestowed upon you by merciful medicus
a stellaron? that's impossible.
let me tell you how it is. we're investigating dakan al-ahmar, and we're gonna put an end to their operations.
isn't it obvious? if we can catch one bailu, the other will come running to us!
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
haha, of course! himeko and her collection -- more than enough reason to come visit the express.
i also know quite a lot about the various folk traditions related to kites.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
it was a long time ago. the same time the underworld was sealed off, i think
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master"
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
it's a common trope in light novels, right? you just have to have a bit of bravado. as soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
uh-huh, sewing is a fundamental skill for everyone in the theater company because we make all our own costumes. did you know that mister zubayr not only can make costumes, but props too?
true, but the story doesn't end there. that samurai's name was yanagibashi takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the souran isshin art.
she specifically mentioned that if you wish to buy anything at the inn, be it food or otherwise, just let the innkeeper know. the commission will cover the cost.
trust is of far greater importance than profit in the relationship between me and my informants.
just remember not to say too much. be discreet.
hmm but you'd draw too much attention if you started speaking bananese too, dan heng.
alright, i won't disturb you two any longer. bye-bye, now.
but not phainon. he is a chrysos heir without flaw, a perfect vessel for divinity.
you mean, like those music boxes with dancing figures? i think i've seen one or two from the merchants in sumeru.
general jing yuan, general huaiyan, it's just as we suspected the rise of the ambrosial arbor was not the end of things, but the beginning.
please allow me to introduce her to you, mister alfalfa. this is miss himeko from the astral express, one of the future shareholders of penacony!
good. i've made some progress in my investigation as well.
since it's a classic puzzle, the answer is "people," right?
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
yes, she needs to know about this now.
all things are impermanent, this departure may be our final farewell. may your way of the ninja be ever courageous and enduring. until we meet again!
doesn't look like it wants to let us through. do you think if i yell at it i could scare it off?
can i stay here a little longer, so i can get used to everything?
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
well then, let us begin. question one.
although it'd still be a behind-the-scenes role, as tianshu, i wouldn't have the chance to get involved in anything truly clandestine or face any real danger.
what's that look on your face? i thought i made good time on the way back.
i know, silver wolf. just give me another minute.
i've come to see myself clearly in this dream journey. perhaps it's what people call a blessing in disguise.
aaaand in addition to the coupons, you can get a visiograph of bailu, our alley ambassador!
i see. well, it just so happens that today's sabzeruz festival is almost over, too.
oh am i understanding this correctly? a masked fool, inviting me to work together?
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
pay attention to what you see in your peripheral vision, and you might just stumble upon what you're looking for.
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
not so long ago, i was still wondering whether i'd ever see belobog's sky again. now, i'm on a train coasting through the universe
if you choose "easy mode" instead, every check will be successful by default, and you won't have to worry about luck playing a factor.
i'm going to count down from ten. if you do not come out, i will destroy the ship.
mister svarog they want to talk to you about going to the surface.
*sigh* you're both impossible. go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
huh, you do seem to travel light. but don't you at least need some pajamas!?
isn't that a bit unnecessary?
i know that your only wish right now is to rest in peace. but you are the only one with answers to my deepest doubts so, forgive me for disturbing you.
wait a minute, now i'm a little confused. are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
you learned the legends of amphoreus from those bath sprites a while ago, but that was a sanitized version that spared you from the harsh and bitter realities of our history.
by following the medicinal fumes, we should be able to retrace the steps of the disguised borisin.
look at you, snooping around and sticking your nose everywhere
new allies of okhema, welcome to amphoreus.
actually, i want to talk to you about our little lynx.
what makes you so different from her? how would you feel if you worked so hard to create something, only to have your boss wreck it and overwhelm you with unreasonable demands?
yes, you're right. after all, the shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
let's go! it's time to pay a visit to pardis dhyai.
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
don't worry. as long as they're willing to cooperate, this'll be a straightforward deal.
when you came to talk with me earlier, i jumped right to explaining my position, and said some strongly worded things.
yes, the items seized at that time are currently stored in the warehouse next to the police station. since kaedehara has come back to inazuma, those items should be returned to their rightful owner.
well, for ningguang she would talk anything and everything out if she could. but i doubt we can do that here.
huh? you just said you didn't wanna complicate things for me, and now you're sending me on a mission
although, calling herself the "protector of order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
as a traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of inazuma. what is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
hmm actually, all of the knights of favonius' masters throughout the ages have inherited the title of "dandelion knight" or "lionfang knight."
the shogun does not make mistakes aeur" she is incapable of doing so. but i, as ei, would like to offer my apologies.
well, it seems that your answers have addressed all my questions.
mavuika has accepted her death, remember? for her to let someone else dictate her end, there can be only one possibility
thank goodness we got here in time. if we'd arrived any later
really? are you doing this on purpose?
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
i'd say that ningguang's purpose is to request that the savior of mondstadt take a more neutral stance or at least, to not wholly side with the adepti.
we also gave quite a bit of thought to the price. we didn't want it to be too much more expensive than a traditional kite.
traveler, paimon, do you have anything planned after this?
i went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
oh, so we're all here with time to spare. what a treat!
if you thought childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence
i take my job seriously! i'd never post something like "late as usual" on a public forum.
gorou, have you managed to acquire one of these weapons?
interesting. i was going to pull a little trick, but now even i'm looking forward to this.
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express one time, just to listen to music?
perhaps it once performed some deed that merited a memorial.
yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. okay?
are you alright? you've suddenly gone quiet. it's not like you at all.
but did he ever teach you how to deal with the mara-struck?
exactly. that, and you are also a kind, well-mannered person with a genuine concern for other people not to mention trustworthy. i would not feel comfortable with anyone else in this situation.
kujou kamaji is wounded. descendants of the takatsukasa clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
i've already thought it through, seele. i am madam cocolia's daughter. that will never change.
we'll leave them be svarog may have blocked off the furnace core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. an admirable deed.
you're right. i've probably been idle for too long -- it's easy to get stuck in your own head.
listen to me, gepard! the origin and spread of the fragmentum is linked to the stellaron. the meteorite in the architects' records, it's--
you should join us, chevreuse. you missed the first few hours of the party, didn't you?
it'd be so nice if all my work could just do itself without me having to lift a finger
here are the coordinates. it's up to you how to proceed.
good. how about you, little one? i trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
traveler, miss kamisato, congratulations on winning the exhibition match.
let's continue to keep a low profile. you can head there once you're ready.
you don't think twice before reaching for your sword, do you? ugh do you have any idea how long i've been tracking these targets?
but how long can your will remain strong?
the heavier the boat, the lower the hull sits in the water. so you can tell how heavily loaded a vessel is from the height of the waterline.
you know, the cruelty has never claimed victory. me, caiyi, your father guangyuan we were prepared for the worst when we enlisted.
but after thinking it over, the only thing that could be considered equal value is the bond i have with all of you.
huh i really didn't expect the people in the city to keep us at arm's length like that. i totally thought the hunters would be treated like heroes.
we are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
hah, did you think i would agree just like that? after our performance of "the little oceanid", i've begun to make a name for myself again, you know.
we soon became the most elite fighter pilots of the sky-faring commission. it wasn't an easy life you could even say it was a cruel one.
ahem, it's called covert protection! keeping an ear out for what's going on around my employer is part of the job.
tell me all about them! i'm all ears!
hmm, i see. so the thunderstorm is drawing closer
i vote monsters. that's the main duty of the hunters, right? we can come back to the sorcerer later.
everything he said is true. your family is probably unaware that you've already changed how you see things.
hmm? go ahead. i'll tell you everything i know~
is it possible that his reputation is fake? is there any way you can check the accounts of the businesses under his name?
on the contrary, we know it well.
in any case, let's take a bit more time to rest now.
the desert's a tough adversary, but at least it doesn't hide anything. what you see is what you get, and whether you take on the challenge is entirely up to you.
however, such a phrase may only be used during the morning hours. also, the party with whom you're speaking must be of approximately the same status as you.
if you're not willing to communicate, then the problem just sits there. if you just keep staring at it without doing anything, eventually you'll watch every last opportunity to resolve it slip away before your eyes.
you could say that! but the main reason i'm here is to take part in the championship!
a nearby merchant folds his arms and gives you a disdainful look. you get the impression that he's someone who has long gotten used to the sight before him.
erosion is a terrible thing. this body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve eternity.
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
walking alone in the darkness, fearing every incoming, invisible obstacle, unable to understand other people's descriptions
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
this is a memory fortune pouch i prepared for the express crew. my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
nevertheless, when it comes to things like ghosts and ghouls, spirits and souls, the one thing everyone knows is you never know what to expect
no, please don't worry. i actually feel relaxed and even a little joyful at the moment.
experience is always the best teacher -- so go ahead and try for yourselves with these two lamps!
oh, we retrieved those already aeur" no need to worry.
...and stopped responding to messages in the same time window!
uh, let's cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we
anyway, the treasure hoarders discovered some previously unexplored ruins that the abyss order has been secretly guarding in the shadows.
also, those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the invaders seven hundred years ago
uh, no, not at all. this place just gets me thinking, that's all.
i see... you've also had a similar experience? then you should know that this me and your memory of me are not the same person.
these cloud knights aren't mara-struck what did you do to them?
perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
also, my cousin wrote back to me. she mentioned that people have started to get sick in yilong wharf as well.
i'm not in the habit of napping at noon, but don't let that stop you if you're feeling tired. i'll give you a wake-up call in, say, three minutes' time.
i also have you to thank. the things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
eric said that we need to take the shopping street to go any further. i think i still remember where it is this way.
let's ask verr goldet where the conqueror of demons may be.
there i learned to read and write from natasha. at the age of ten, i started to patrol the mines with oleg, occasionally getting into fights with the local thugs
right. especially with someone outside of the shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
what are you waiting for? we won't hear anything at this rate.
i'm merely performing the duty required of a master.
wait, i have an idea! how about we use a little reverse psychology? instead of chasing lady bailu, we get her to come to us!
i can also smell a mix of elements in the air. pyro, electro and some other elements as well.
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them
yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
moze's signal is nearby, but we lost contact just a moment ago
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
what now? what are your plans?
your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. i imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
remember the current affairs and planning stage of the assessment? since the successful candidate is duty bound to implement their plan after taking office, their manifesto tells us their stance on key issues.
count me out. i've got plenty of work to do here for the homayani family.
i'm not the type that's easily swayed, rahman. you of all people should know that.
the wisdom and experience you've accumulated over ten amber eras are truly impressive.
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want. we will likely meet again.
naeur"not at all. this is just my duty.
indeed, it has been a while, huixin. i'm flattered, but aren't you exaggerating a little?
but folks from the realm-keeping commission descended on the area. it's too loud over there now pass! pass!
a shattered emptiness draped in the guise of desire... his existence is strikingly powerful, yet the self beneath is extraordinarily faint.
that's enough knowing the enemy for now. come on, i want to see what the ring looks like.
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
film! did you hear that? that film he mentioned must be the same one that was stolen from the museum.
sit back and enjoy the duel.
even if the same plot of soil is covered in flowers the following year, the one you remember won't be there.
you really have a knack for asking the most uncomfortable questions, don't you
the other method i'm trying is using the wooden tiles as coupons. just by writing things like "buy one get one free for the holder of this tile" on them.
for some reason, i feel like i can open up to you
and as for you try to stick around the city until we get back. you don't want us to call the folks from the corps and have them drag you back to the city.
i don't think anyone realized, but back then we were so close we didn't even differentiate between each other's possessions. we shared pretty much everything.
time sure flies. now, both my sister and i are residents of the netherworld, and we will never again feel the thrill of a competition.
he has so many great swords that he never uses. sometimes, i can hear those swords crying is this what people mean when they say "spoiled for choice?"
we reported it to the akademiya many times, but they never sent anyone to deal with it. we didn't want anything bad happening, so we were going to cancel all the stage performances.
wildfire wants everyone to leave the underground but mister svarog wants everyone to stay here. according to his calculations, the overground is already unsafe.
in my dream, that was the day i died.
do you see two people standing by the door? they look like spitting images of each other. are they twins?
whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. did i miss anything big while i was gone?
anyway. i'm only telling you this to stop you worrying, so that you can focus on something i need you to do for me.
is it that obvious?
but now that i have your help, the idea is feasible
our mission started the moment we arrived here.
if you were just wandering around, or if you agreed to be sealed away in an experiment pod, that would be fine.
did you organize this entire breakfast?
ugh, i'm not that big of a baddie you know
i agree. you possess many qualities similar to those of adepti, despite having none of their blood.
she already went back. as you know, she has some things to settle with the supreme guardian.
sometimes when i'm running late, i even have to change back into my original form and climb over walls to make sure the parcel's on time.
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means
when writing up a proof, i only use three words: "obviously," "evidently," and "naturally" aeur" isn't everything self-evident anyway?
i'll let you make three moves.
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
that would be ping. you probably know her as "madame ping."
condolences? well, that's unnecessary.
but the truth is right here in front of my eyes, and i can't deny it.
think pom-pom will like it?
the sofas here all look tailor-made -- perfect for vip guests!
we're still preparing the starskiff for the ceremony. please, everyone, come back to me when your work is complete.
i can, however, provide some artistic guidance from the vantage point of a highly experienced audience member.
you are a woman of method and integrity, i see.
what are you doing here? look, if i get into trouble, it's my problem. i don't want to drag you into it.
that's why the shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. it's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
you make a good point though. i should drop by more often in the future. that way, they won't get so bored.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
but i see what you're doing reverse psychology, huh?
hush now, keep quiet. this is my moment to shine, so just listen.
hmm why don't you show me around and introduce me to the others here?
so, how about this? i've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
at a critical moment, someone distracted the monsters and led them away. just when all hope seemed lost, the tide turned.
i just have one question. even if we manage to get the misleading info out to the guards, how can we be sure that they'll believe it?
indeed. any fears i had a moment ago seem to have been dissipated by the dango milk.
they're my favorite flower, so i wanted to give them to you, my favorite person.
hmph, i may not be as well-read as you, but my mom taught me a thing or two!
give me a few minutes, just a few. i'll explain every--
 then perhaps there won't be any reason for me to go on the journey with you after all.
because she is a god. it's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
when we were trying to find a way to save the theater, we heard many stories not of the theater, but of the people whose lives have been touched by it.
i'm guessing that her sudden illness made her feel like she may not be able to realize her dreams anymore. it also made it difficult for her to hold onto the happy memories and dreams she had.
*cough* i never knew ferrying souls stuck in limbo could bring this much pain
oh yes, please do! i'm sure ms. rekhar and miss najia would also love to have a chat with the two of you.
that was the gaming association -- turns out they're making me stick to the rules.
but i think i failed. maybe there are other things that you guys do?
daring to send things despite knowing that i'm the heir to the sinners of mondstadt i'll remember this insult.
he shakes his head and continues to regard you with skepticism. in the end, he decides to inform you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
and in your plans, the ipc always wins. even if you lose the bet... to the family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.
talk to amber sometime. i'm sure you'll like how energetic she always is.
we should be close to completing the ceremony for this actuator.
given the type of person she is, if she did have any clues, she would seek out our help. if she hasn't shared anything with us, it means there is only one possibility.
this tastes amazing! i'd better not have any more, or i'll never be able to go back to my usual rations.
no, that's not it. you can often find me talking with other girls.
think about it -- you helped me fix my machine the first time you came here, and now you're helping me the last time too that's called having a beginning and an end, right?
back then, i didn't even dare to dream about having someone to confide in.
there's been some work done on this place in the past, but it's a bit of a labyrinth inside. i can't guarantee we'll be safe once we're underground.
this is a tuskpir of the xianzhou zhuming: warm, sweet, not for consumption.
well, this is a dramatic change, unique in all of the millennia of liyue's history. everyone is eager to do their part and make their mark in the age of humanity.
it's for your own good, little yunli. while you desire to compete against each other, i don't want to see either of you getting hurt.
plus, the easier we can make it to enjoy, the more people will want to participate!
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
you two as well. no matter how busy your adventures get, remember to come back to inazuma. we'll always welcome you, no matter when you drop by!
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
it's too bad he was held back by his belief in king deshret, but now that that's changed, i guess we have a few more people on our side.
the truth does not lie. neither do memories.
in the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the navigator mentioned we'll have to try a little harder.
does this mean you know them personally?
hmm yes, i feel a lot more energetic now, thanks to you.
especially those who came in pairs. nine times out of ten, they were here seeking to know their future fate, hoping that it would be a lifetime together.
so, you think richard was the one who stole my encryption key?
hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," urakusai.
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
while taking a walk by the lunarescent depths, i spotted general feixiao chatting with them. if you wish to visit them, you can head over there.
you really don't have to. i'd like to hang out on my own. bye!
i won't go too far, and don't worry about me getting bored. i'm an expert at finding ways to pass time!
as in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
sorry if the theater really ends up getting demolished, then you, sohrin, and abhi will all
good afternoon. it is normal to feel drowsy after lunch, might i interest you in a game of go to stimulate the mind?
idrisi and the others all used to say that they would quit if there was no mora to be had. but when it came to avenging my father, there was no mora to be made anywhere.
rare blessings like these we mustn't let them go to waste.
we had a difficult start, but things got easier. look, that's the barge i was talking about.
no matter the method employed, our bodies will eventually return to their original states.
the family itself is a huge, perfect building. like... a living idol.
really? why do i remember everybody thinking that luck was against us and feeling like we hardly had a chance of succeeding?
like right now for example. it's just about time my final "guest" boarded the ship.
the tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment)
yeah, i told the boys to gather as much information as they could. most of the reports concern violent incidents, but there's also some talk of smuggling.
i know what you're thinking, but alas that girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
just how much work did you do to force me onto this stage?
then let's continue our conversation. please, topaz, invite "sweet dew" to join us at the table.
but in my personal life, i'm just an ordinary person aeur" someone who feels anger and sadness, just like everyone else.
okay i need some time to emotionally prepare myself anyway.
his invitation to debate this matter publicly was a chance for the more difficult business owners to hear from you directly.
i came here today to support you as the head of the homayani family. no warning will change my stance on that.
i know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
the dendro archon smiled. the next second, the sage found himself lying in his bed, as if he had just woken up from a dream.
miss kiminami, how do you do?
so, honorary knight, what is your choice?
hehe, thanks, you two! i can't tell you how great it is to have you by my side. almost makes me feel like i've been blessed by the goddess of fate, too!
i'm sorry, you probably just wanted a relaxing stroll, and here i am dumping all this heavy stuff on you.
what else can i do? identify what's malfunctioning within the audience system and fix it, of course.
alas, questions like that are above my pay grade. that is for the ten lords and the general to figure out.
just like how at this present moment, the virtues possessed by the both of you have turned into a warm current that pleases my skin.
about music? i'd say i'm more of a casual listener than a hardcore enthusiast.
if i said "best for the universe," would you believe me? hehe best for me, naturally.
i believe it's not something external, but something that originates within us, an emotion that traverses time from a certain moment of our past to reach us.
the barrier hasn't been fixed yet. don't try and be a hero, gepard!
a world that many across the universe don't even know exists
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley
try not to let him see you. we want this information to be as truthful as possible.
so as we follow the story, it leads us to specific scenes? sounds pretty innovative. what does the message in the envelope say?
you're not wrong hold on! why do i still hear you in my head?
there's always a way for me to contact him if i need to, so don't worry!
i understand. the luofu is in danger, and members of the six commissions should stand united.
my father has committed many atrocities, and deserves all the punishment that he has coming to him. i have zero sympathy for him. you may call me an ungrateful child, but my feelings will remain the same.
hmmm "a setting sun that never sets," "a dragon that cannot fly," and "a moon that only shines at night."
if it's just pain you're afraid of, i might have a solution
yes, that was also my thought.
i gave him an assignment. he's taking part in a surprise attack against the shogun's navy.
maybe if you turned that frown upside down once in a while, he might feel more at ease.
my tears wouldn't stop, and i couldn't see anything. i kept gasping for air until i collapsed in a pool of blood
in those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
huh? can coffee get rid of dark circles under your eyes? no wonder it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission
whoa! you're so patient -- you really peeled off all the layers!
he'd say, "you'll be fine as long as you remember to stick with dad," but even then, he left most of the parenting to the brigade. the one thing i do remember is that he used to tell me stories.
as i have told you, you are a suspect. before your allegations of theft and illegal entry as a stowaway are cleared, you are to remain silent. don't make me say it again.
thank you all so much! your understanding and support make me feel a lot better.
ah, i shouldn't i have left the human world. please contact the yuehai pavilion regarding matters concerning the commercial port.
oh, sorry, i'm doing my tour guide thing again. i'm sure someone as well-traveled as yourself has seen much fancier equipment than this.
but as cunning as she is, the divination commission has managed to find something.
anything special about that name?
fancy running into you two again! what a pleasant surprise~
while a cursed sword grants instant abilities to its wielder, it comes at a cost.
leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of inazumans.
not to mention that if you live in a packed and bustling city, it's much easier for people to trace your steps. this creates all kinds of issues, and gets in the way of my ability to track my targets.
i never leave a question unanswered. i am a ninja, aka rappa.
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise
which means that you, svarog -- uh you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld for the time being.
this swing is covered in dust hey, don't sit on it! it's filthy!
that's for you to make a considered judgment on.
even though we believe in different gods, we can all come together as friends by playing cards at the table. we should be willing to cooperate and assist one another in the future.
but a well-trained aristocrat would not only effortlessly proceed forward, but do so without a stain on their garment and their elegance fully intact.
"o weary yet free soul, even the most verdant leaf in the forest will pray for your happiness and safe passage."
ever since you encountered those borisin spies, you've been so busy that you've hardly eaten anything. you can't defeat hoolay on an empty stomach.
here for a show and here for the day, but bring your wallet 'cause you get what you pay~
a new card back appeared on the market recently. it's extremely rare, and bears an image of a treasure chest.
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now
wait, hat guy, what's that sword around your waist?
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
everything's fine. we were able to suppress the borisin attacks. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
you're comparing apples and sunsettias there. whenever beidou returns to liyue harbor, all she brings me is a headache.
he informs you of the locations of the monsters with a disdainful tone, as if he's certain you have no chance of making it out alive.
wow, that's really nice of you!
i'm afraid that wouldn't be very convenient for me. it'd be better if you two went alone.
it's also essential to clean it often to avoid a buildup of dust, and it's best practice to hire a craftsman to perform regular maintenance
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream
hmph, looks like your mighty architects weren't as all-knowing as you thought.
why don't you return to mondstadt and tell your parents what you just told us?
the streets aren't owned by the merchant guild or the ipc but by those who live here.
nope this terminal is offline, we can't control it from here.
see? my takes on fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me
in life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
first to find gets to stake their claim. seems fair.
huh? but didn't you just say that you had something important to do?
long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
i will lay this issue aside for now. but we shall revisit it as soon as the tenryou commission has resolved our internal issues.
those two who were snooping around were just a couple small fries. if we wanna get the real catch, we have to be patient and give it some time.
correct. such are the twists of destiny.
outsiders, seele, the second wave hasn't started yet. make the most of this opportunity and make a break for it!
i have to agree. the tea there is very good.
looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
i knew you'd come around. on the xianzhou you're the only person i can turn to for help.
in that case, let's play a match of genius invokation before you depart from narukami island.
for real? hmph, never mind the gift i got for you then
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
and you didn't hear anything else at all? nothing that might leave an impression of any kind?
we're going to look for firework materials shortly. while we're out, we'll sort out the boat situation for you, as promised.
now that is an interesting question.
shouldn't this be expected of a memokeeper?
say what's on your mind, and do what you think should be done. if we fail after that, then at least we won't have any regrets.
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh inconvenient situation.
yes, the artisanship commission and alchemy commission conducted a joint examination and found that the parts of this machine are made from specially refined borisin bio-tissue.
good, and please remember, safety first.
what!? don't think i won't revisit this later.
no need to play the hero, i'm going with you!
it's almost as if you joining the crew has given everyone an extra boost of energy...
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder
that's exactly what i had in mind! nobody knows who's gonna come out on top! it could be me, could be someone else it'll probably be me, but whatever happens it won't be him!
she did -- she saw me on her way over. she told me to go to the repository and read up on anything related to the ambrosial arbor.
i hope everything's going well for you. don't be like me, worrying all the time
hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. this'll make excellent source material, too.
i also have some ideas of my own. i'll fill you in after i've confirmed some things.
lady aglaea once said that your time is extremely valuable and shouldn't be wasted on unnecessary conflict.
i remember seeing a picture of a depth crawler in my childhood -- i insisted to my parents that we had to go and see them my parents told me how they had been extinct for thousands of years.
oh, i love hero stories! tell me more when you have time!
no no, just giving gifts isn't sincere enough i should personally apologize to the conductor.
that's why i'm here looking for you. sure, it's an order from my employer, but my conscience was also telling me it's the right thing to do.
(i need to rethink things. this is a crucial moment, so i can't mess up.)
in essence, someone rescued a drowning man and performed some music. if that were all there was to it, it could have been many people aeur" human or adeptus.
just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the nihility...
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the sacred sakura's roots?
i don't blame her. i got excited when i heard people arguing at the dock and the rest is history.
this lot won't be able to slow down the astral express crew.
is there really no difference between our strategy and the ipc's?
and yet she didn't come to any of us for help. that's not like her.
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
you'd better be careful. don't get too close to blitzara when you're knee-deep in the water, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a very unique lower-leg massage.
...but that won't come to pass. i'll do as you ask. i'll leave.
i know of you, traveler. you're ningguang's guests, yes? didn't expect to meet you here in the mountains.
farewell, nameless.
...even the space station handbook doesn't get updated this frequently.
if being a workaholic were a disease, skott would be in the icu! it's okay to enjoy your work, but causing trouble in society is another story!
they sure made us run, though. if i ever have to run like that again on the job, i'm filing for worker's comp.
so, not only do you think i have a bad temper, but you also think he's ugly?
nah, i could've taken it on by myself. but still fighting alongside you two was pretty fun.
stay here, warrior do not leave your goddess of death. the enticing scent of blood here is meant for you, and only you
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
i think i understand.
the prophecy gave him a new mission, granting him a new life as a chrysos heir. but which is more important to him: his new mission or his desire for revenge?
thirty years ago, my mentor served as alchemy commission's cauldron master. she recognized the emerging undercurrents and sought to cleanse the source of the disturbance.
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
mister dvorak, i will need to discuss with you the number of musicians who will be coming to liyue, as well as their catering and accommodation requirements
and that's the only cocolia you guys ever got to know, huh always ahead of everyone else, never looking back, even for a second
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
i've been reminded of many people, too. kitsune saiguu, makoto, and all the other friends who i watched pass even further back.
in light of your contribution on this matter, i will allow you to take part in the next ludi harpastum.
clara, we'll help you investigate what's going on with the robots.
she was there. she just made sure no one could see her.
i mean it literally. i sense your burning desire to live, but unfortunately, you don't have anything of equal value to offer.
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation
dealing with an institution that controls all of sumeru is already hard enough if the doctor were to crash the party, it would be next to impossible for us to achieve our goals.
ah, the permanence's descendant what a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
if you had no intention to trespass, then why did you return to the xianzhou ship before your exile was lifted?
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
be good kids and stay out of trouble, alright? stay in the city for now, and i'll come play with you after the fireworks start.
sounds good to me, too. everyone makes mistakes. what matters is what you do to make up for them.
now the fatui have no choice but to keep their mouths shut.
it's a little bit like porridge? but the resemblance is only superficial
don't you worry. you still have a long journey ahead of you your story has only just begun.
as per our rules, any free-roaming heliobus must be sealed away. i was merely following protocol. besides, it was tail who requested this
stop staring at me with those wary eyes!
hah. well, i'm afraid i'm having far too much fun to stop what i'm doing and start bickering with you, captain.
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
i do not know what to make of it either.
the artisanship commission delve should have suspended operations after the stellaron corrosion began. why haven't these people taken starskiffs to safety?
my cousin has quite a collection of books about sumeru desert mythology on his shelves. i highly suspect that he, too, is looking for that domain.
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe an explanation.
i just finished a commission in the desert for a usual client of mine. nothing too interesting just escorting a shipment of goods. i'm on my way to report back.
i'm sushang of the cloud knights. i think you already know the little girl with horns on her head. and this is
this is not something that an honorary knight can accomplish alone. i will mobilize the rest of the knights to assist.
it requires one to take their sword firmly in both hands and cut down the hopes and dreams of others even those of one's closest companions.
more importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
gentlemen, our preliminary inspection shows that there is indeed hidden biological tissues inside, just like the craftsman feared.
no worries, i hope things go smoothly.
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
it seems you haven't heard yet. the theme of this year's lantern rite is "kites."
a memory zone of this level is mere child's play to a memokeeper. come on. let's head out through the front door.
ninja initiate gigaku, deliver your final line.
this memory zone is overly twisted. i have to use inelegant methods, so you two please give me a little time
ha! i finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. oh, i must say it feels good.
i like chatting with silver wolf. she's got a lot of ideas for someone so small.
if we can't find a way out, we may be stuck underground for some time.
oh, but yanfei, there's one thing you might need to mentally prepare yourself for.
hmm i give it a nine point five!
not to mention, making incense is a labor-intensive process. you won't see anybody in the desert with the patience to make or sell something that requires that kind of effort.
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
you sure don't miss an opportunity, do you?
anyone else who comes into this domain in the future will take one look at the ruins before them and conclude that this place was abandoned years ago.
where are you going? please take me with you~
let's see hmm oh, looks like you each have enough points to choose one final skill.
if the people of today can derive enjoyment from this activity, they will not only be more likely to better appreciate the tradition, but also to pass it down to the people of tomorrow.
when the flatbed trolley passed, he opened the box and got into an altercation with halsey, which caused the loud thud.
i am deeply disappointed in you, elder. your thoughts and intentions are completely devoid of empathy. cloud knights!
...mister yang, before answering that question, i wish to continue the previous topic.
so the interastral peace broadcast specifically broadcasts the news? that's exactly what old mettle likes.
i'm so sorry, arlan. until i spoke with dan heng, i never realized how much pressure was on your shoulders.
overwhelming strength, and unquestionable authority?
indeed. no longer will i ignore their passions and dreams.
madam ruan mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so i asked the researchers to keep things simple.
when the desert-dwellers set off on their quest for knowledge, a sage once said, "knowledge always comes at a price."
this is the only advice i have for you, from someone burdened with a blood debt.
so tell me. what, specifically, makes this matter so specific?
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
i've weakened blade's senses to the outside world so that he's only able to hear my voice and feel my touch -- he's oblivious to everything else.
that should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
nor is daring to make me personally concerned about his safety. hmph, he has no idea what's coming to him.
what do you think? is the food to your liking?
by the look on your face i'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword"
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
from a director's point of view, i also felt like the relationship between the two musketeers in the original story could be improved.
as for how we'll communicate with lynxy in the future we'll have to have a good think about it.
my eyes might not be as pretty as yours, but there's no problem with my vision
as long as i can enjoy every day with a drink in my hand, tasty food in my stomach, and a good night's rest, that's enough. i'll only work when i have to.
i'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
right there, the tallest building in the city. it's also the headquarters of the sky-faring commission. let's hurry. we haven't got much time.
well, that solves our problem. you have our thanks.
mm-hmm. as long as you can keep up.
"ultimately auspicious" wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
however the homayani family has treated me with nothing but generosity and kindness.
don't be alarmed, this is wupei. he's wenyuan and shanghua's colleague.
i just want to tell stories from the past: stories about aeons that have fallen.
i i don't know much about warfare, but i don't see why a commander needs to lead the charge. the situation here is totally different from the restricted zone.
and, who knows, maybe i'll find my own magic along the way! all i can do is try, right?
also, why is this high wall here? and can a wall really block sandstorms?
precisely. i've been without sight since the day i was born.
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
faced with a calamity of such magnitude, we have agreed to put our differences aside for now and unite against this common enemy.
i'm sorry you're right. i'll consider what we've found, and not jump to conclusions just yet.
there's nothing to be worried about! just take a step forward, and give yourself a chance.
to which i replied: "don't bother. ningguang has no time for suck-ups."
just answer me. when do you cry?
many people have been lining up since well before dawn to acquire one. i'm afraid if you're only showing up now, you're probably too late.
however, i doubt anyone would believe me, given there are no signs of a fight.
why is that? is your constitution somehow different from the average person?
but elder, your actions have gone beyond mere survival you've become a beast driven solely by the propagation, devoid of even a hint of empathy.
very good. and murata?
of course! we always do lots of eating, toasting, and gift-exchanging. we try really hard to show our appreciation for everyone.
sure, i'd be happy to. what do you want to chat about?
the general is a true master of maximizing returns for minimal effort. i cannot match him on that front.
yeah! he gets my vote too, being my ancestor and everything. oh, and also the silver swallow!
"in other words, any place where people can effortlessly begin a dance will for sure be filled with the blessings of everyone's happiness."
just what crime did you commit exactly? they recalled a bunch of guards from the front line to track you down -- it's unprecedented. now they're patrolling the whole city and everyone's in a panic.
no, it's just a trace of her consciousness left behind after creating this space.
hmph! i'll remember your unwillingness to comply! mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
alright then. don't worry, it'll all be fine. i'll be right back.
my job is to honor my contract with rex lapis by looking out for the interests of all living things in liyue.
as it happens, i was just having a discussion on backup plans with my secretaries before you arrived.
here we are. according to the judge, this area is not yet under control, so we should proceed cautiously.
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
thank you for inviting me onto the express! if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the zhuming!
but with the arrival of the stellaron, things have become messy. some delves even had their entrance marked as the exit.
"moon rage" isn't so much a disease as it is my past and future. one can let go of the past, but must always face the future.
everything alright? you feeling okay?
ah, this is great! i feel so relaxed all over, i could almost float away.
there is still some time. have a skim through, get a first impression of what each person's proposing.
us silvermane guards have fought against the fragmentum for far too long and have lost too much even though you've solved the stellaron problem for now, the number of casualties is still staggering.
but if you were to choose the more trustworthy person between myself and keqing
there is someone who can attest to my true intentions.
i still occasionally practice suturing on my old teddy bear, just like in the old days.
back so soon? any news?
you've seen many such injuries before. if not properly treated, the man will likely fall victim to serious illness for the rest of his life.
i'm going back to my dessert now. you all can keep discussing that on your own.
mm looks like i still have a lot to learn
i've brought all the lighter gifts with me, but the silks are still on the way. i just submitted them for delivery, so i'm sure they'll arrive in good time.
before she retired, she told me, "for as long as you live, never forget what dance means to others."
and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
sure, i understand. i'll be waiting for you here.
positions, everyone! we'll move on to the next scene after we try a few more kamera angles.
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
i think so. but it's hard to distinguish between reality and illusion here. i can't be sure.
you mean, what are they made of? it's geomarrow that's undergone a change in color. the color of geomarrow is related to the environmental temperature during its refinement.
we will transfer ownership of the radiant feldspar to the astral express! a meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.
what you might not realize is that all too often people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
gotta start somewhere. oh, by the way, did you guys learn anything about the meteor shower?
don't ruminate on it. take this chance to get some proper rest. the nights are long on dragonspine.
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want.
no one can refuse the secret of the aeons, not even zandar. we'll definitely get a response.
speaking of champions -- have you heard the story of the mysterious "elite player?"
and those mechanisms protruding from the ground should we attempt to activate them?
looks like the second round is over. i wonder who was faster, kaveh or madam faruzan? huh? where's madam faruzan?
the same can be said for all of us.
we should proceed with caution. the kujou clan descendant may well be in trouble.
yeah. even though she has already decided to stop fighting with her father, they never managed to have a real conversation with each other.
after all, you saw makoto in there, didn't you?
anyway, the script calls for a team of four. ah, yes. we're missing one final player right now.
how could a person ever be transformed into water? this is reality we're talking about here, not some magic trick!
it is time for the soul-soothing ceremony. please make your way to earthrise agora in starskiff haven.
no. i will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. memokeepers don't need a dreampool anyway.
mingxi, please ready your questions.
nope. i met him and you at the same time.
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
why was this tv dumped on the side of the road?
well then. the door is open. hop on in.
i don't know how much you're willing to believe me but ororon really is a good kid. i see no reason why he'd suddenly get involved with the fatui.
anyway, it's just a legend. i see this view every day on my way to work -- i'm kinda bored of it.
but northland bank is a special case. i rather suspect i would not be welcome there.
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
we may live underground, but we won't be buried by this city.
if that's the case, i should thank you for protecting my mentor by exiling her, general.
i actually thought you had cooked it all yourself
you go ahead, no need to worry about us.
locking the door was necessary. i don't think we could have saved two.
naturally, we shouldn't let our guard down. if you discover anything out of the ordinary, please report it to me at once.
you need to choose your words carefully if you want to persuade him of something. it might be best if i talk to him though i'd need a strategy first.
hmm, so you mean you don't like handling disputes over petty matters?
if you still don't believe me, then try asking these two men. they're also against the akademiya, but neither of them are as arrogant as you are.
more curious than my appearance is the fact that she and i don't see each other anymore, wouldn't you say?
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
he's just surprised that it has resurfaced.
that's because that wall records liyue's secrets. merchants have always been attracted to secrets.
he needs you. it's essential if we want to reclaim penacony. recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, i opted to join forces with him.
i must say that amber's development has impressed me recently. i hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale.
i don't need any compensation. all i'd ask in return, if you're willing, is that you tell me some more about the life and work of your late director.
all in all, i owe everyone a big thank you. it would've been much harder if wildfire had operated alone.
the right to punish inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. not yours, signora.
hmm probably a scene from ancient inazuma.
hey! silver wolf! look! it's screwllum, your good old opponent.
here, look someone deliberately scratched off the paintwork -- didn't even do a good job of it.
from the sound of it, it seems like you're asking me to leave penacony.
but why did little gui have to get dragged into this? this mission is too dangerous for a civilian!
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
count me in, too. but is there some sort of dress code or anything for the feast? can i just show up looking like this?
belobog's history and culture museum was founded six hundred years ago, and was originally built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa
i admire your confidence. but what was it you said earlier about declaring a winner before swords were drawn?
i had heard that the kujou clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the tenryou commission. the search for a successor to the role of tenryou commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency
gorou, if you want my opinion, you should be more concerned about ms. hina than you are about this.
oh, mister ryuunosuke is making them right now. you can go collect them from my house later.
when you heard that did it make you think that maybe i really was a cynical profit-chaser after all?
hear that? ding a ling ding a ling my silver hairpiece is ringing like a bell! the wind is nice and gentle today.
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
i'm glad that you found a new life here in penacony, it's just
well, i'm sure the summons were a part of it, too.
but i'm also aware that not all emotions in this world are positive if there are too many negative emotions that go unchecked, then someone needs to step in and stop them.
don't worry about it too much. the more flustered you become, the less likely you are to find it.
this assertive aggression silvergun shura's words, before they were sealed, must have been just as fierce as yours.
my bow sounds in peak condition. one shot is all i need.
sharing senses allows communication to occur between the consciousness of different people. naturally, memories are also involved in that process.
have you guys heard of the luofu?
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
such determination it makes me wonder what secrets are hidden within you. a step will not be recorded.
the destruction? i don't understand
but that does bring me to a question i've been mulling over in my head do you think there's something else going on in her life?
which means that the content of this book must have been approved by her in fact, no. it may even have been her idea in the first place.
well, if nothing else, all this proves that the doctor really did have some urgent matter to attend to, and left sumeru in a hurry.
don't worry. once the fight is over, i'll personally escort you and mister luocha home~
is that a promise? good. otherwise, i'm going to have to reconsider whether i want a librarian on patrol with me.
i have put out the order to seize all delusions.
that's fine. i'll shift to exercise mode and jog off the excess sugar.
fine, let's see whose desire is stronger, your desire to take it away, or my desire to hunt down all cursed swords!
the skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than i imagined now that i'm on board.
let me put it bluntly -- aurum alley merchant guild has no chance of succeeding today.
someone as perceptive and wise as ping will surely have come to understand and embrace this.
i couldn't ask for your help and offer nothing at all in return, so this is my gift to you.
hmm that would be quite strange, yet such a scenario can't be ruled out.
i've heard that even the unofficial genius invokation tournament is enjoying a huge turnout. many serious tcg players have registered for both the official and unofficial ones.
fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
"foreign object"? that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
gladly, beats standing here twiddling my thumbs.
perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
you crept in here to steal nous' memories, didn't you?
she's always bragging to me about it, but it's difficult for me to really imagine without seeing the place for myself. can you take me there?
hehe, so i'm right? is this lesser lord kusanali responding to our celebration of the sabzeruz festival?
but the good news is, you passed the test. the fact that you'll keep some cards close to your chest even in front of a major ally actually makes me more confident in you.
i agree. he'll decline any question he can't answer anyway, so you might as well give all of them a shot.
since we can't determine if your shipment is safe for the environment, i guess we'll have to wait for its biological activity to expire. let me check the previous cases
would you be willing to join me? c'mon, take a break from adventuring to listen to a story.
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would
i wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
oh. so you're not a mondstadt youkai?
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
the law only judges criminal behavior, and does not weigh human emotion. the court's verdict can settle the question of criminal liability, but
of course i remember him aeur" the young master of the feiyun commerce guild. i have dealings with his family all the time. who knows maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too.
darn, i wanted to see one
oh, in layman's terms, it will simulate the aeons themselves. then we can ask them questions.
nothing in particular. i just thought it would be nice to have a companion.
once the whole dendro archon thing has settled, everything in sumeru will take a turn for the better. that makes me happy, too.
i should go back and give that place a spring-clean sometime. never know when it might prove useful again
perhaps there's an issue with its language module. this little guy probably can't understand what we're saying either
we've arrived. there's an elevator here, just like in the lobby. we should be able to reach our destination with it.
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
yeah! an actual assistant! c'mon, don't be so distrusting -- do i look like someone people can't rely on?
you're talking weird again but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
i wouldn't be so quick to push aside the need for redemption.
humans traverse the path of fate... seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist...
i suspect the reason they're dragging their feet is that they have their doubts about whether the show will really go ahead, considering all the issues you've been facing.
ah, yes: "true love cannot be controlled by external forces" little layla's belief is a classic one.
it looks like someone used it and then destroyed it -- possibly kafka.
because of the crossover meal deals, the alley has seen an uptick in customers.
a reward won't be necessary. i'm only acting according to my way of the ninja. riches are not what i desire.
so, you were saying aeur" "the little oceanid"?
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
besides, i'm a researcher how could i not get excited about the chance to explore new worlds up close? everyone gets tired of living in small places like belobog after a few years, right?
tell everyone about mother's true motives about a lie perpetrated for seven hundred years
yes, providing the question pertains to something i am knowledgeable about.
calm down, how many people do you think we'll be buying for?
sorry, i invited you thinking this was going to be a happy occasion. i didn't know that things would turn out like this
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, and solemnly kneel to the ground with utmost sincerity.
as i passed by the palais mermonia, i heard that neuvillette was investigating a case with you.
so much for your memory. did you forget the architects expelled me ages ago?
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
and now, the wayob have sensed a special surge within the ley lines. a truly ancient soul is about to return to the mortal realm.
i'd like to earnestly thank you, traveler. if it weren't for your companionship, i would still be embroiled in my inner conflict right now.
hesitation never did anyone any good.
phew finally. i think i must have left cadet school with about the same amount
you mean to say that you don't trust me completely?
for me, living one's days out like that is too repetitive
ah! i've figured it out! i heard a loudmouthed guard say that a group of outsiders had met with cocolia you must be them?
yes, you're absolutely right. this is what i appreciate about you, you see things the way they are rather than how they appear.
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring
the "attack anything everything module"
i'm not asking you to point your spear at me. could it be that the abominations here aren't enough to motivate you?
huh? is there anything you'd like to share with us, mister bolai?
so i would advise you to be cautious.
careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
miss serval is cool, strong, and carefree
be that as it may, i don't remember anything. there's nothing to help me make a choice.
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
you should take this opportunity to rest, lord phainon the coreflame ritual is tomorrow.
on the contrary, i think it is those that i have known longest to whom i should extend the greatest courtesies.
it seems we have reached an agreement. the hearing concludes here.
well, i did, which is why
during the irodori festival, the area around the outlander affairs agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
i would certainly feel at ease here, whether it be while reading or working.
it's a pleasure to meet you. you may call me lingsha. i have returned to serve as the head of the luofu's alchemy commission after completing my studies on the zhuming. if you are feeling unwell, i can arrange a healer for you at any time.
looks like she's done with her questions
one after another, people were taken by the water all those treasured lives and memories, washed out of existence in an instant.
well now you get why i didn't want to share any of this with you.
now please be a good boy and don't move.
if crushing our enemies was as easy as breathing for the reignbow arbiter then what purpose did our sacrifices serve?
you see these people? they're all miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
the commission wouldn't normally cause this big of a fuss over a stowaway.
it seems there are three of them. looks like they can only be unlocked one at a time.
fortunately, we don't seem to lack supplies, and even our motley crew has people who can keep their cool when the stakes are high.
i trust my intuition more than any words.
could it have malfunctioned? it appears to be normal
your technique was all over the place, and you relied too much on speed. is this really all the cloud knights of the luofu can muster? so disappointing.
i brought gallagher here. it's time to face the "truth."
grandpa almond, could you take the concoction to the room underneath the tavern and place it next to the transparent bottle you found? i'll handle the rest.
it's a bit of a mouthful, but i liked it at the time it was a rock 'n' roll name.
even though i initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you
ah, that's not necessary. no need to be so serious. it was nothing, really.
hand them to sara. she can examine them for herself.
don't worry. the shogun's not broken, i've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
from what i can tell, in the past, if a student were to put off their studies to watch a show or dance, they'd be called foolish and irresponsible.
i'm sure you've all heard about how i have taken on the role of hydro archon. indeed, i am furina de fontaine, your new archon.
fine, i guess we can swing by and play with it if it's not too far. what's our destination?
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair
to the everyday citizens of mondstadt, everyone in the lawrence clan is scum. it's natural for rumors and unwarranted gossip to lead to such suspicion.
it's kinda hard to explain
that makes sense. you usually solve problems directly, without the use of any such tricks.
as you can imagine, the conclusions that the evidence points to are not mutually exclusive. which means this is probably another prank from miss sparkle.
do you remember how you got here? or what happened to your body just now?
he did not realize that this sound could be heard by everyone in the opera house, which is why he claimed earlier that he could not hear the sound.
thinking back, even if she wasn't too affected by my absence, i do feel guilty.
after that, no one came to the theater to scold me, either. we actually gained many new customers and, they were all akademiya students.
but how can i change her mind? i've tried, but she won't listen. i don't know how to get through to her
okay, i'm done asking.
that thought has even crossed my mind a few times. it's like saying, "what's wrong with adapting to a new life?"
the next round will be the final one. please rest up before then, everyone.
actually, now that you mention it, i'm suddenly a little hungry. huh. amidst the thrill of the chase, i didn't even notice.
hehe, who knows, next time, you might see inayah on the stage.
however, due to an order that was given many years ago, nobody has moved between the overworld and the underworld in a long time.
try to keep all that in mind of course, it doesn't really matter if you forget, since we'll be assessing them at yuehai pavilion in a short while.
they seemed happy. if i had to take a guess, i would say they finally found the kind of life they always wished for.
draw him back, using what i know about the instincts of spirits. as we all know, clairvoyance is usually conducted with the goal of unraveling mysteries.
nothing's wrong, okay? come on. we're going to war.
we're not taking a photo!
i understand your concerns, but i'm sorry. i just don't have anything to tell you.
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
this lady is really something else!
the situation is ever-changing in a card game. to emerge victorious, you have to be willing to take some risks.
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
i'm willing to make an exception, considering you're guests from beyond the sky. but if i were to bring both of you in at once i'd be blatantly disrespecting our traditions.
in that case, maybe you'll be able to explain everything in detail for us now?
miss gui has set up a social media account under the guise of investigating paranormal phenomena and unexplained mysteries we can use it to gather intel for our mission.
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
we mustn't fail her determination. i'm not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.
so the event's sponsor is here too? is today some sort of special occasion or something?
whether it's driving starskiffs or leading the sky-faring commission, madam yukong is always present in the xianzhou's course. i'm still lacking in my skills as a helmswoman.
so, even the blazing beasts were
of course, it's always a pleasure to be in your company.
i'll keep working for a little while longer. my mind's at peak efficiency at this hour, so it's the perfect time to go through the clues and piece everything together
sure enough! these parts are from the museum's sculpture!
tonight seems to have gone off without a hitch. i'm so glad it's all going smoothly.
at first, she didn't really want to say anything to me at all aeur" she just gave me yes and no answers.
klee? oh, and it's the honorary knight and paimon as well.
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
let's talk about something less serious for now. would you mind giving the three of us some space, tribbie?
rather than hearing endless explanations, would you like to experience it for yourself?
still, since the clues are pointing toward the blackcliff forge, we should see where they lead. we may well find something new.
since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. i never thought i'd enter the underworld that has been sealed away for so long
the marechaussee hunter before you appears to suffer a serious mental breakdown. he needs to leave the room for a moment to collect himself.
aha, perhaps such plans have become second nature after all the diplomatic issues i've dealt with.
i'm qingque, a diviner from the divination commission. you wanna play celestial jade? okay, come back during my work hours.
congratulations, you won! come on now, let's hear your victory speech.
you can always rely on mister svarog to come up with a brilliant idea! so, i guess we'll have to go find a new robot shell to fix it, right?
a judge of the ten-lords commission has no past. once one has entered the service of the commission, all links with the outside world are severed
if you live far enough out in the sticks, you have plenty of legitimate reasons to ditch work. the mountain path was blocked, or you ran into some treasure hoarders en route
if so, then you underestimate me. i am quite well-informed about the vision hunt decree.
remember when i mentioned that the cloud knights blocked all relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing happened? stargazer navalia is not under lockdown.
that means you also have a good head on your shoulders and the ability to learn rapidly.
it's just like idrisi said i also want to catch up to my father, and become a character in his play.
now that was intense! i can't remember the last time i had so much fun.
good morning. did you sleep well?
"really? but i don't taste... any difference at all between them."
argh! i've never seen this stuff before!
i'm not sure, but i suspect pascal's tormented sense of self stems from him being constantly attacked by his fellow robots.
always distinguish between reality and imagination alright, grey?
hmph! didn't think you'd accuse me of goofing off never mind the gift i got for you then
i didn't talk to you on the train because i knew you and i would get to talk alone here. worth waiting for, don't you think? you seem to have a lot to ask me.
oh, i guess miss sparkle has written herself into the skit here, and this has nothing to do with the actual case. goldhammer -- is that her real surname?
sorry, no can do. without the slip for reference, i can't make the same one again, and i'm afraid sakujirou is the one with the slip.
c'mon if you learned how to play, then you, welt, and march would only need to find one more person! you could get a table going and play a few rounds during your travels.
it's a very long story, so let's deal with the problem at hand first.
however, if we find evidence to corroborate the claims of collusion between the fatui and the tenryou commission, i expect you to fully comply with our investigation. do we have an understanding?
nice to meet you too hehe, you're very polite.
gepard! way to make it obvious.
ever since the adepti left liyue harbor in the hands of mortals, we qixing have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
treasure one way to draw your target out of hiding.
hmm sounds like the voice is coming from inside the train.
yes. maybe we're already used to bad luck, and we know how to deal with feelings of sorrow and disappointment.
see you in the qualifiers. blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
i feel bad about this
don't let her words distract you.
at least the choice is in my hands.
then i will obediently follow you to the shackling prison and receive whatever judgment awaits me there. don't worry, i'll keep my end of the bargain.
you are in fact the best candidate to represent the knights of favonius.
and, the tuskpir loves "strong" memoria: the more depressed you are, the more happy it'll be. isn't that right, little fella?
understood, thank you sir. then i guess this is bye for now, unless
i saw you the day before the goethe hotel. gepard took you to see mo-- the supreme guardian. he told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
after some back-and-forth, we confirmed that the doctor has left sumeru by boat. he has something urgent to attend to back in snezhnaya.
haha, love it, but i bet there's a lot of songs with that name. it sounds like something randy would play -- he's one of my favorite legendary guitarists. may he rest in peace
on my way back, i rescued a springvale hunter who was being attacked by a monster.
the situation has changed, and it seems that companion... has deviated from the original plan.
don't forget, she's on the ipc's most-wanted list -- a fugitive that nobody can seem to pin down and now we've become her prey while she stalks us in the shadows.
it seems only fitting for someone of your status.
quickly, over here, miss march. this is a "reverse mentorship gift" from me to you. i hope you put it to good use.
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
honestly, i didn't expect our ragtag bunch to do this well. we just came together last minute to save the archon, you know?
my people are used to the desert life but still, i hope that one day, they'll be able to find an oasis of their own, and leave the sandstorms behind for a better life.
do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? or was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
the dangers lurking within okhema have been eradicated. i've also cleansed the city of filth.
mm yes, i eventually realized that i was overthinking things.
according to the report, lord ravager phantylia is the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.
a space station, but that's not important.
ah, right. i knew about that even when she was still my subordinate.
there aren't any scary people here, right?
curious? about the heater? it's just a standard geomarrow radiator -- you can find them anywhere in the administrative district.
oh, yes! that's the one. i remember when he drank it aeur" hee-hee, i've never seen him enjoy a bottle of wine so much in his life! he was telling me all night about how good it tasted.
deshret's relics may have been a force to be reckoned with before, but their name means nothing now.
the express? shouldn't you be asking himeko instead?
yes, collei and i discovered a fairgrounds in the forest.
the secrets of history shine through in the relics that survive, and this one now has the story of another age to tell.
because i wanted to change myself.
something has come up, and i would like to request your assistance.
heroes, your attention please.
robots aligned against humans? i've never heard of such a thing. machines should obey humans unconditionally
come on, camping is about teamwork! let me have a try.
bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. you should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.
if i were one of the stellaron hunters, i'd be very happy to capitalize on all the chaos. it'd be harder to escape, but easier to blend in.
lighting the incense will signify continuous growth and prosperity in all our endeavors in the new year!
mm you're right, it probably doesn't
aww, poor thing.
it's okay. i find it quite interesting. i didn't realize that this was how ordinary people viewed the shogun.
mm i truly hope so.
we at the tenryou commission will forever remember your contributions to our cause. i will be sure to reward each and every one of you properly once this is all over.
in the name of the architects, i shall stick this spear into your nostril!
from now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. and after all the experience they've gained, i'm sure they are more than up to the task.
oh? i guess you're pretty clever. but before you open the pouch, you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
all you need to do, dear spectator, is to witness my performance until the curtains fall.
the coast is clear. you can come out now.
that's just how it is aeur" most of the people in my life will be gone one day, just like a flower.
that's right, we're investigating something that happened recently.
i think we've all seen enough now, and we have ample witnesses to my flawless reasoning.
you were so quick. i've only just finished my third dessert.
adepti sigils serve as a means of integrating the mechanical devices with adepti art. they are as indispensable as the mechanical core itself.
though your power was weak, i was still able to find you. you were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
if you wouldn't mind, we'd like an explanation.
arlan... i'm sorry. i never knew i was giving you so much pressure...
alright, kameras will start rolling as soon as the set is ready! let's make a film that'll make some serious waves in fontaine!
hey, dunn! it's been a while. i didn't know you made security captain.
after all, how can i know which answer is which?
yeah, but don't worry, my lady, it's all water under the bridge to me now. i had a huge argument with my father, and left that place behind for good.
finished exploring? i still have one last special gift for you.
yes, i better think about aventurine's proposal.
are there any other clues around?
indeed, we wouldn't have found out if it weren't for mister bolai's aid.
the captain of the guards reluctantly allows you to assess his condition. right as you're trying to get a closer look at his leg, your hand slips, and collides against his wound with great force
the feiyun commerce guild's youngest? you must be talking about xingqiu.
well, um, yes but aren't you just repeating the rules?
just tell him the palais mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. he shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
is that so? i am delighted to hear it.
i've been waiting a long time for this, hoolay!
what does it matter? don't worry about it, it's all part of the fun.
i do hope the knights of favonius are all working hard
i'll bet, poor you this time we're gonna avenge you! i'll show those heliobi what happens when they mess with my friend!
yep. have you been there before?
"sparkle has disguised herself as another character" wouldn't that be you, mister sampo?
oh, so you're here to take part? well if we bump into each other out there you'd better be ready. this time we're gonna show you what we're really made of!
as far as i can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
...it seems like i'm too old to qualify for that.
okay, okay, i promise this is the last time.
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
you're too kind. actually, i think we could learn a lot more from your talents. that's why we can place so much trust in you.
together with norbert's mumblings about a "shopping street" i think all these clues are pointing in one direction.
fine, let's finish up here. but i'm gonna put it out there -- we're not gonna forget those lines of yours anytime soon
the world remains constant over the centuries. but human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. transitory.
hmm i wonder if we can find any clues here?
according to the plan, the ceremony will begin in six hours. the skysplitter will be activated, and all visitors will board the ship to watch the contest.
i want to be like her when i grow up so i can protect everyone and protect mister svarog!
mister gallagher likes to keep his softer side hidden, and even though he might seem a little disorganized at times, he's always there for his friends when it matters most.
if ganyu has a secret and she wishes to keep it that way, nobody should make it their business to try and get it out of her. that's just basic decency, is it not?
hmm? alhaitham didn't go with you?
hold still and don't move three, two, one
following its celestial trajectory, the great teal star illuminates an endless sea of white across both the sky and land.
you scratch my back, i scratch yours. it's as good as done aeur" you can just go twiddle your thumbs or something while you wait for the good news. bye for now.
he's as stubborn as i am. it could be an argument or a fight -- he'll do both to the death that's why he bugs the heck out of me!
madam yukong, do you remember? perhaps that was just an ordinary flight for you. but for a certain child
most of you were not aware of their arrival but it is thanks to them that our world now flourishes with hope.
i've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near fountain plaza. don't worry, i know my way around the administrative district.
in that case, would you mind describing it to me?
besides, i'm the one who should be apologizing -- i've put my own personal reasons ahead of belobog's reconstruction
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
please can you explain to us again the details of the case?
yo, it's you! you're interested in the supernatural, right?
come, let's pay a visit to the palais mermonia. the rest of you, head back to the rehearsal location for now, and wait for our good news.
my greetings to the both of you. long time no see.
if you don't want anyone else to know, we'll definitely keep it a secret!
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
i've only smelled something this sweet and enticing once, when i was little.
hmph, listen to her. "what is the meaning of this?" she still thinks she's an overworld princess.
not long after i submitted my preliminary report and application, i received my punishment. it was obvious that somebody didn't want my research to continue.
the the emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
it seems we've had a little tagalong all this while
hey, you're friendly with "rain calmer," aren't you? i hear she's a tea drinker, too. why don't you treat me to some choice tea from her personal collection?
yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
that's so kind of you, huixin. you went to great lengths to organize this.
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so wanna come with us?
this isn't good if what those kids said is true, then the museum thieves have operatives working in the settlement.
pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. now you're trying blame it all on me?
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
sorry i'll be sure to make it up to you.
but i am worried if the heliobus possessing yanqing is too strong, i'm afraid i might not be able to guarantee everyone's safety.
listen: elio can foresee the future, but he can't make decisions for you.
no need to be polite, i can help any-- huh? you're just here to say hello? you don't need my help?
this hivemind could make breakthroughs in problems that even the smartest geniuses can't crack.
not telling yet we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
if you could let me know what i delivered, it would mean a lot to me!
and you've also heard all about ororon. i must say, he's always been a good kid. i can't see him joining the fatui of his own volition aeur" he must have been coerced somehow.
i've seen the ipc's approach -- they prioritize efficiency and a standard uniform business model across the galaxy.
it's about time! didn't you say our part of the plan is the most important of all? tsk, and here you come rolling in late.
sorry, but it looks like we'll have to put our meteor shower search on hold.
ah, a word of advice for you before we part ways -- a word of warning from someone who's been in your shoes before
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
herta uses that place to welcome visitors from across the stars, or to welcome members of the genius society. however, due to the legion's invasion, it is no longer open to the public.
you sure know a lot, mister luocha.
huh? no no no no, i can't do that
i serve ningguang, the tianquan of the qixing. the scope of my work includes some of liyue's biggest secrets.
there's nothing to worry about. we just need to go through the schedule you made and tick the items off one by one.
"if you become human you can reveal your secret to no one. you will face suffering and loneliness. is this truly what you want?"
or do you seriously think northland bank won't throw you to the wolves when push comes to shove?
another day, another drained social battery
ah traveler, paimon, you made it. did you rest well yesterday?
yes, but the rule of the game is no fishing rods allowed. we're going fishing by hand.
my friends and i used to wander those streets thinking about where to find our next meal. that is, until chief oleg got me out and took me to the orphanage.
it's the main commercial street in the exalting sanctum, although it's a lot quieter since the whole stellaron crisis thing.
what do you mean? that's me too, y'know. the "me" that my patients see, at least.
i only heard her voice. i wouldn't say i saw her
"acheron..." merely a borrowed name. you know my nature, remember my deeds... thus, i am acheron.
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
don't look at me, i told you i'm not taking a chance with that thing.
but after she said those words: "the time of the adepti has long passed. if even the liyue qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for liyue"
everyone on the express is a passenger.
our uh our exchange only represents my personal views. if you wish it so, you can file a complaint to the ministry of civil affairs.
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
there it is -- it's hazy, but it's ifrit's voice. the other one is probably his progeny.
i admit, seele is talented. we do work well together. but that's all there is to it.
i know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
hmm. so even i, who seeks eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence
i've only been gone, what? a few months? and the space station is already in this state?
sugar-coating the facts, kind lies it's all a big waste of everyone's time.
but now, i no longer cling to what was lost. i suppose that means our differences have been reconciled.
baishi has always been very passionate about her work. i can leave any task in her capable hands and rest assured that her performance will be nothing short of exemplary.
which is why we sought you out, to help the astral express save the world together.
yes, of course. you were frantically flying and dashing about throughout the entire thing. not an elegant sight at all.
that's right. but let's discuss it once director hu's done with you.
herta have you ever met her? i'm curious about the tastes of someone who used their own name for a space station.
maybe this all sounds immature to you, but i feel just the same way. i want to live life not as kamisato ayaka, but as an ordinary woman.
true. in his eyes, i'm just another ordinary person from mondstadt.
if you can defeat the ringmaster selected by the xianzhou, you'll not only win rewards and prizes but also be making a name for yourself.
sadly, i can't. too much work on the space station.
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath "exchange with your precious things."
now that you know, at least we're all on the same page.
you've never ever seen a flying sword before?
generals, i am finished with my questioning.
the crew members' rooms
alright, then let me ask this. the ideas in zhiyi's manifesto are very similar to your own. is there any particular reason behind this?
i don't quite understand it, but i'm happy that we're able to all meet again.
we still need to eliminate the guards as soon as possible. if we give the sages enough time to realize what's happening, the plan's doomed.
they must be annoyed that things didn't turn out as planned for them.
yes. the reconnaissance company is tasked with patrolling this route during the festive period
oh no, xianzhou divination is nothing like the superstitious scams you see elsewhere. it's based on a technology called the jade abacus.
there was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than yae miko, the wise and beautiful.
i accidentally overheard how the express obtains fuel.
we won't reveal the names of any victims. we'll just post some pics and videos of the squad engaging in fierce battles with the supernatural! and then come up with some dramatic titles
oh my, i didn't know you had dreams of stardom, dan heng.
do you know anything about what makes you special?
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
there's actually more than one memokeeper who's come to penacony -- she mixed me up with someone else. but no harm, no foul
no need to hurry. our deal is hardly the urgent matter here. atoning for your transgressions is the main order of business.
also, we'd be able to gain control of theofan, yusupov's second-in-command. then we'd have a pawn in the ranks of the fatui.
master capote's life wiki version twelve point zero!
well then. i look forward to both of your contributions.
no. no one's completed the task yet why, has something happened?
this is an arduous mission, and i must heed the voices of all to determine the best candidates for this campaign.
the ability to look into others' memories sounds like something that could easily be misused. luckily, you're the one wielding it.
i didn't understand at the time. how can we say that we are maintaining eternity when things are constantly moving forward and evolving?
oh, come on, don't listen to his empty talk.
if it involves helping people in need, count me in too.
this place is the rift between dream and reality. a place reserved only for those who have awakened from ena's dream.
now that this place is cleaned up, let's set everything in order and move on to the next zone.
if i didn't make any money in the morning, i'd have no food for lunch. i guess that's why i came to be so obsessed with mora.
otherwise, i may not be able to hold back mister zubayr this time.
alright, i understand. i'll be sure to take care of it.
although they aren't around anymore, they're preserved in our tradition of dance. this outfit i'm wearing is apparently based on how the goddess of flowers looked.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure
oh, really? then i won't disturb you.
maintaining an orderly residence incentivizes us to adhere also to the rules that give order to our lives.
not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. she always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
glad to hear that you're feeling better, mister stream. it's also about time for us to go to our next destination.
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
mister svarog, i want to help pascal overcome those negative emotions. i want to take on this responsibility.
of course -- i wouldn't ask you to start a whole investigation from scratch.
the report did mention abnormalities in the surveillance system and module errors... we'll have to start prioritizing those issues.
care for a game of liyue millennial? it'll give me an opportunity to see exactly how good you are as a player.
alright, we should be getting back to the harbor as well. we don't want to keep her waiting.
once you draw your sword you must strike down your adversary in one blow without turning back.
what's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? seems pretty normal to me.
still, talking to people i don't know is really draining
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
hey, don't you understand? you're currently the prime suspect for a major case! this isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
did he succeed?
you regard the stone tablet in solemn silence. the names of your comrades etched onto its surface serve as a reminder that you are never truly alone.
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall
sorry, did you have something you wanted to say to me?
hearty combat and exciting adventures not bad, i certainly don't hate it.
hmm, alright. we dare not refuse such generosity.
i knew you'd ask about this. go on.
such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of eternity. i'm afraid i'll have to consider it further.
i have business to attend to in the palace of astrum -- the rest is up to you. convince the old shopkeeper, and you may just become the new heroes of aurum alley.
i looked everywhere and i found some clues regarding the treasure hoarders. besides wagon tracks, i also came across bits and pieces of fireworks packaging scattered on the road.
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
then for now i will excuse myself. qingni's irresponsible actions caused much trouble for the two of you -- allow me to apologize once again on her behalf.
thank you for inviting me out. this trip has been quite eye-opening for me.
no general can win all battles i have to admit, that was an excellent show of skill.
in other words, even though you didn't exactly choose to be our apprentice, you still need to take the initiative during this learning process.
but i'll try my best for lesser lord kusanali. if i can somehow use my abilities to help you, then count me in.
before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
show yourself now, before golden thread is stained with your blood.
though blind, furuyama is unparalleled in his ability to appraise tea. he brews some of the very finest tea in all of inazuma.
indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of "death" and shared this truth with all of us.
will you stand with me by the window a little while? no need to talk
qianwei is a wealthy entrepreneur, mingbo works at the liyue ministry of civil affairs, and zhiyi is focused on study and travel.
unfortunately, they picked the wrong fight this time. once we return to the yaoqing, i'll personally lead the verdant knights into battle.
stop hanging around here and find something better to do. once i'm done in a few days, call up lil gui and huohuo, and let's grab a meal at aurum alley. it's been ages since we hung out.
i didn't plan anything. it was the future. we interfere on countless future possibilities and make the best future a reality.
but why so coy today, huh? you only gave us his age and description, why can't you reveal his name? is he sumeru's most wanted, or something?
hold on, the quality of this space this isn't reality. it's a realm of memory!
here is the pass permit. show it to the okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
"when you see it you'll scream!" that's so cliche, with the arrow and everything "failed your starskiff pilot test? you're cursed!" tsk, people are always looking for excuses
by the way, what did you do to that man earlier? it was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.
let's not forget that i am the eldest daughter of the kamisato clan. i would be very surprised indeed if anybody in the kanjou commission felt that i was accountable to them for my actions.
understood. keep monitoring. keep me informed should anything come up at the institute.
seriously? bring the whole crew, why don't you? tsk
trying to pull anything out of a sumpter beast's mouth is like playing a game of tug-of-war
we'll never find the oracle pillars in all this mess!
go ahead and talk to the buyers. they'll give you the answers you're looking for.
the lord of the night is an ancient entity that rules over the entire night kingdom, constantly borrowing the power of the sacred flame to combat corrosion from the abyss.
they are entitled to that rage because lord mydei was once the hero of castrum kremnos.
the qixing have approved ganyu's proposal. over the next few days, i will be working with mister dvorak on behalf of the qixing to facilitate the organization of this concert.
do we have an agreement? well then. no backing out now.
even the toughest long-life species would have a hard time enduring this.
to the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. luckily, i'm ei's familiar, so i can sense her rough whereabouts.
me? none. what cocolia and the architects get up to has nothing to do with me. my time is too precious for pondering.
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
the four beacons have been lit, but we still don't know what trials may lie ahead.
i never thought you'd be such a bore. never mind! if you stick by me, everything will become clear.
much as i expected. the insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists you seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
i haven't moved. what you're seeing is one of my remote-controlled puppets. they're all over the station. i just connect to one wherever i am needed.
barbara is always happy-go-lucky when she sees such beautiful scenery.
you intend to travel all over teyvat, and the time has come for the inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
i think i just saw a group of void song whales fly past the window.
if the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. i wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking
they thought their god would protect them. they had absolute faith that when disaster struck, a divine power would save them from harm.
all right, looks like you don't believe me that's fine, i'll ask you again tomorrow!
but i have to say, after clearing out all those unnecessary items, i feel much more refreshed.
miss seele, did this medicine belong to miss natasha? then can you give me some? the vagrants' injuries are quite serious.
hehe i wish you both a fun-filled time on narukami island.
i want to go with you, i do! i always wanted to catch a glimpse of the stellaron with my own eyes, and now it's so close
uh, not the best time?
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless
with your swordplay skills, you can effortlessly take down ipc mechs, march.
i must return to the tenshukaku and report on what happened at the exhibition match to the almighty shogun. everyone, please excuse me.
the murky mirror reflects the view of inazuma in a bygone age. spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
aha--! i knew it, i always have an eye for talented people. no problem, take your time.
boarding exam? like a test? i can do that! that sounds like the admission system that schools in belobog use!
since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy lantern rite.
so many buttons how many centuries would it take to press them all?
guys, i feel like this is just some sort of prank or a marketing stunt to boost ticket sales.
wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. like i said, you can think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground.
don't underestimate my ability to exact revenge. hah! sara won't get the upper hand this time!
as long as everyone enjoys the festival activities, all our efforts are worthwhile.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down
come, young man -- i'll let you finish up.
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
who would've thought the general would take such a liking to you? i suppose i must accompany you further fate can be so unpredictable.
the rules still stand. these little ones won the tournament and passed the ultimate trial, which means they'll be taking elchingen and kautilya's place.
in the past, overworld soldiers on the front line would lose their lives in droves, and yet the fragmentum's advance would remain unaffected.
"everwinter hill" what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat?
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet
oh! my dear poet, you have my utmost gratitude for the aid you have provided us.
that's enough when we return, there will be consequences.
the healer does not heal himself. don't try to act tough in front of me.
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii
the impairments of short-life species can be corrected with ingenia or surgery, but that's an impossibility for xianzhou natives.
but you allowed argenti to take you away?
the things i've learned come from a mix of secret techniques taught by the millelith scouts, real-life cases of competition in the business world, and the experience of various overseas organizations.
correct. you don't even feel a lock hole on the cell door.
so dangerous you're lucky to have lived till now.
i seldom had the time to drink tea. any free time i had was spent practicing martial arts.
yes, for a puzzle that was designed from the start, choosing any other path would be a pointless mistake.
you know something, gepard? that guitar case in your hand, and my guitar they're both from the same prototype -- the "super electromagnetic flux player."
you could take the view that whatever i say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the ley lines.
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
that's just a bunch of drunk talk. engur and delavar like to talk themselves up when they're drinking. "engur the wide-eyed butcher" and "delavar the scar-riddled bandit" are the nicknames they came up with for themselves.
hmm? what's wrong? these are the five principles for maintenance of the "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder," and i haven't even finished explaining the first one
hmm some of these are true junk, but there are a few items of value here.
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
you should talk to amber and bennett. they're not as well acquainted with dragonspine as i am.
you're an archon, but you act so humble. you really don't need to be so polite with us.
what were you looking at so intently just now? let me see.
a regular customer? you?
so, you want to see me cry? that might be a little difficult. a show of anger, though that might be something i could accomplish.
what's the hurry? don't get too close, or he'll see you.
do you feel any closer to becoming the great hero you've always dreamed of?
yes, we're all here for you.
shanghua is a business expert who gets his information by trading, wenyuan relies on word of mouth, and there is also wupei, who's not here right now
uh something doesn't feel right. it's obviously an abandoned shopping street, but it also feels like people were here not too long ago
the vagrants or, to be more accurate, the majority of people in the underworld regard robots as nothing more than tools.
hmm. this is indeed an invitation letter issued by the yashiro commission. now that we've confirmed this guest's identity, i have no further questions.
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition
how was she? did you deliver the medicine?
i understand how hard it's been on everyone. the resistance army's rations have barely changed at all since the vision hunt decree was first announced.
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
i'm not good at acting all master-like. since grandpa asked me to teach you swordplay, i won't hold back any secrets.
but my family are only distant relatives aeur" we branched off from the main family line long ago. by my grandpa's generation, the only qimen he knew was a few parlor tricks.
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
i'm sorry for making a scene, but i have to melt down this cursed sword! i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands!
she might be tougher than flesh and blood, but not being able to feel pain? i don't think that's a good thing.
the principle behind this machine and the one you fixed when you first came to the workshop is the same. you'll understand when you see it.
i'm sorry i really can't help you with this.
and your masters, the kujou clan of the tenryou commission aeur" they are the ones keeping the truth from reaching the shogun.
yeah, and that's why i love it here.
okay aeur" confess, and we'll go easy on you. my patience is running low, so why don't you do us both a favor, hmm?
hey! wait a sec -- uh those intruders, i wanted to ask. what crime have they committed?
i've poured all my best effort into this fireworks show. and now that we're here, i sincerely hope you will enjoy it.
perhaps you thought i'd planned an intensive training session for you? heh, that won't be necessary. on the contrary, when you're constantly on edge, you miss quite a lot of important things.
i've heard that a skilled masked fool received an invitation too that must be you, right? did you enjoy yourself?
suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
according to the plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if they've discovered anything.
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
she hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
for us to meet now is premature. nevertheless, you set foot on these islands at precisely the right moment.
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
alas, our work is never this simple. putting aside all that onerous legwork, a single glance from droidhead could vaporize the entire space station if we're ill-prepared.
otherwise, you won't even catch me in a starskiff.
but how dare you bring your petty disputes into the safe haven of aaru village?
lady tianquan, the gate of initiation is now ready. we are good to go.
otherwise tens of millions of mora is rather a high price for lunch, even one at liuli pavilion aeur" wouldn't you say?
when i run, time seems to flow especially slowly. being able to think at a leisurely pace is quite nice for someone with my impatience.
draw your sword. don't you know it's rude to keep an elder waiting?
i say you belong to the space under the manhole cover, not in a dream. there's one right over there. off you go!
you don't want me to have to bark like a dog in front of all those people, do you? besides, i'd really like to help the people in aurum alley.
hee-hee, so it's just a random thought
unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...
i will say, i never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, clorinde.
while the both of you were roaming the city, someone was paying attention to your every move. unfortunately you have broken your promises.
i'm curious about the express' trajectory. will it pass by the place i call home?
i've been hoping to raise all this at the peace talks and discuss it properly. grievances have to be let go eventually
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
they should have thought about whether they were capable of paying the price when seeking the power of an aeon.
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie
these people they send me the most extravagant gifts
hmph either way, lessig is going to be in charge of making lunch for everyone today.
alright. no more questions. i hope i didn't take up too much of your time. let's continue on our way.
i hope you'll grow up happily in this forest.
thank you for the repair, xingxi. this is a great help.
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
of course! this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- i can't miss it.
maybe seasoned veterans have an instinct for it.
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something
this is svarog's turf. where to now?
in my line of work, combat skills are essential.
not there. come back.
no need to explain! this is professor capote's autograph alright, but you can't hide your handwriting. the way you join your letters is no different to your childhood diary entries.
good question, what should we get hmm? wait a sec, why are you taking our order?
but that's fun too -- the masked dreams connect to each other seamlessly, like you're walking in a maze. maybe one day, i'll find the way out!
i suppose we have let our focus drift a little but at the end of the day, you can't deny that this ocean view really is something.
with the major changes in liyue recently, the ministry of civil affairs and the millelith already have their hands full. they don't have any time to investigate rumors about treasure hoarder activity.
i'm always trying to convince mister svarog. please give me more time
the reason i'm willing to bet on you is because of your special status. i think it'll bring me a lot of leads that can get me closer to the truth heh, so, got any news for me today?
i know that you poured great efforts into these plans, uncle. but you were well aware that it was not the right thing to do. as a knight of favonius, i could not overlook your actions.
that won't work. firstly, the act of bringing a new team of guards to a neutral negotiation site will put both sides on high alert.
but, since there are so many doors here we should be able to leave through one of them
ahaha, i must be the least ambitious person who's ever set foot in pardis dhyai.
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
come on. the auction is being held at yujing terrace.
that's more than enough. we've proven that the order is unreasonable as it currently stands.
it's a hairpin in the style of a white heron. as well as a hair accessory, you can also use it as an ornament.
it's not your average washbasin. this ceremonial vessel belonged to the chrysos heirs and is now my gift to the both of you.
if you are to stay in okhema, you'll need a place to rest.
the almighty shogun i have seen her on but only a few occasions, most of them formal ceremonies
got it. so from now on, i'll be in charge of this operation.
looks like i'm quite famous on the xianzhou luofu, too.
well, it's part of my responsibilities as the cauldron master. so, where would you like to start, general?
may everyone accept you as one of our own, and may the forest of blessings be a place you can call home.
hehe don't worry. i've already made arrangements for that. everyone will have their fill of meat. but to be clear, still no alcohol.
are you dealing with attacks like this every day?
let's see if we can find any clues here before we plan our next step.
uh no, no, that's er, i'll pass.
hi, astral expressers well, you caught me.
i declare you my chamberlain. in other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the shogunate and loyal to me.
anyway. it sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see ei's less formal side.
three devices in total. and look, the light converges in one place. albedo, are we able to deactivate the shield from here?
to be more precise, i was trying to look for him in the world of souls. after all, i also have no idea what he might look like
if i remember correctly, you, march, and dan heng came here on that train -- the "astral express" -- right?
if we really want to do this right though, it's the thought behind the gift that truly matters. the more thought goes into the gift, the better the recipient feels it.
my advice would be to get on. you're not doing me that big of a favor by staying anyway.
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point
i have laid my heart bare, and in return, i just want you to make a single promise.
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
after all this is over, i'm putting my vacation time in with madam herta. i've got it all planned. i'll hop on an airship and give the blue a good look.
some vagrants also make modifications to their pets, which they call pet upgrades.
take this man away. this does not involve him.
navia, the president of the spina di rosula
manners, manners come on, you won't find another granddaughter as polite and well-behaved as me!
then you look towards the sky and release the kite to soar among the clouds.
but thinking about it since we're already this far, then i'll turn a blind eye to any new grievance.
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
(something feels off about all this. guess i'll just have to improvise.)
one of them was perfect for stargazing.
is there anything we can do to help you, mister stream?
no, not at all. don't be so nervous, i'm just here to look around.
the way i see it, "operating in secret" and "exposing the paranormal" go hand-in-hand.
it'll be fine. even if the sky collapses, we have the master diviner with us to hold it up. oh, and now we have the general here too.
sorry, ms. ying'er, something's come up. please let the others know i had to leave.
ah, right! i mustn't look at you too long, or i'll be drawing more attention to our difference in status oh dear, i've already stared at you for quite a while.
as for what has triggered this change, i believe it must be the loss of his vision. for to be stripped of one's vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
it's pretty much the same situation here. neither party is willing to compromise.
hello. may i ask what happened here?
as for cocolia, the best side of her will live on in people's memory. that's not all bad
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise
then you'd better ask him about it. it's got nothing to do with me.
outlanders, why did you lend your aid to okhema?
let's act natural, determine who our tail is, then lure them somewhere more deserted, so we can catch them.
he was loud and foolish, with no real sense of purpose. instead of doing anything useful, he spent most of his time drinking and chasing after women.
every day i see silvermane guards sacrifice their lives in the fragmentum, but i've never had the resolve to change mother's mind.
the alchemy commission detained me for some time for a health examination. they released me only after ensuring i was in good condition.
lord gnaeus, the calling you're heeding
a single slash of a blade... isn't really accurate. it was actually two blades, just that the second one was faster.
what's wrong? why are you both gawking at me like that?
so, what did they want out of it?
anyway. now that i have been defeated by you and your plan, i will honor your wish to abolish the vision hunt decree.
calorie surplus detected digestion mode engaged.
but those things are all in the past.
one, no, two empty liquor bottles ugh, tell me you guys, are these the kinds of things that a normal person would leave behind?
it seems more than a little reckless to charge in when we don't know what's ahead of us.
come with me. miss dunyarzad, please come along as well. i still can't guarantee that this area is safe.
if you require resupplying during your journey, you can always count on us.
i don't need anything, either! so long as you continue to request my international courier services from komaniya express, we're golden!
no matter where he is, he will transform into a soft breeze and return to his homeland.
what, is he famous on the luofu or something? not even the cloud knights on the zhuming, who all know my glorious name, might recognize my face.
not bad at all. i'm glad you finally got to reveal the tricks you've been keeping up your sleeve.
i knew it. this will be a breeze for you.
i'll get in touch with wildfire and the silvermane guards right away and have them investigate the matter thoroughly. but for now let's take the parts we have back to the museum, or we'll be here all night.
we're all like neighbors, so we're always helping each other out. it's easy to forget that everyone's running a business.
vanquishing general? isn't that title a bit too narcissistic? i don't like it.
compared to you, i really didn't do much at all.
your understanding of the layout of stores and vendors is most detailed.
calm down, i heard you. it'd be rude of me to depart without thanking our benefactors.
by reading our minds and showing us what we want, it creates the reality that we want to be true everything it does is either to get us to lower our guard or to wear us down.
didn't you hear him? he said he needs to take care of a few matters in the city first. if we're fast enough, we can stay out of his way.
their imitation of long-life species has crossed the line.
looks like you have yet to forgive me i understand.
but later on, she would actually smile down at me and say, "just the opposite, in fact."
at last, i have found you, you who returned from jueyun karst.
in other words, you believe that he knew nothing of the incident?
hmph, over two hundred years, and not a single lasting connection. this is my punishment, huh
perhaps he plans on doing so, but i won't.
who? oh, that young lady who loves to prank. i'll remember her name when she finally understands the game that adults play.
she stares at the screens. is she looking at herself in the mirror? ...what does she mean by "try again"?
oh, you're here again! so, what's your decision?
that was the mission my grandfather entrusted to me. you just relax and keep guard over the ring.
from what you were saying a moment ago, it sounds like you know a way out of here?
you mentioned earlier that the troupe was like your "home"
also, i've seen you instructing ayaka. that cold and dignified personality is exactly what we need for the older musketeer.
i plead not guilty. how can i be guilty?
the traveler is a national hero in liyue whose actions have directly contributed toward the prosperity we enjoy today.
it's alright, you're safe now. we'll bring you back.
i'm not sad. it's just that this dream is so loving and forgiving.
oh, was she whisked away by work already? i was just about to tell her how great she did.
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya
i know, right? i did a lot of research before i decided to film here
listen, i'm just updating you on the situation, not asking for your opinion. i don't really care whether you continue your investigation.
well, the situation here is pretty similar to when you first arrived. it's just that instead of a few thugs and broken robots, now we're dealing with much more formidable adversaries.
the people answered the call of the architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
yesterday's experiences make me stronger today. and most of those experiences are ones that i share with you.
it's okay. they're all my guests.
i gotta say, it does intrigue me, the way we all ended up here together.
even though i may fail, i'll do my very best for everyone's sake!
don't get the wrong person, though, or all our efforts will have been for nothing.
before i met xiaohan, i always imagined everyone at the ipc would be like skott -- overbearing and dodgy.
very good. it's essential for the kamera operator to understand the director's vision. i'll make my decision after seeing your work.
i can assure you that she is exceptionally capable. all the doushin from the police station have vouched for her abilities.
when i tried to pull her out, we both got pulled in to a cold, dark place which, i soon discovered, was the border.
you're proud to be a hunter. you're still holding on to that part of yourself, no matter how small.
i helped set the underlying mechanisms for this type of gear bridge. it's controlled via different terminals in combination. let's go find them.
i see, so you had big shots helping you. i guess that won't be of much help to sakujirou.
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides
this slope has a good view it'll be easy to watch the aurora.
perhaps, judging from the outcome this is that person's true intention.
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
at least give me a proper introduction! genius society number eighty-three of all my outstanding achievements, that's what you want to mention?
of course you may, but you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
come now, there's no need to stand on ceremony. loosen up a little.
if these items are unclaimed, we may take them without controversy.
the grand sage is in his custody. even i know how terrible it is to fall into cyno's hands, so he probably does, too.
i imagine that an item as delicious as this dango milk must sell exceptionally well, no?
yes, i did say that.
so that's why you wouldn't understand how hard it is for a bad person to try to be good. it's impossible for me, and i have no intention of acting like a good person.
we do? i hadn't realized. i've received rigorous military training -- coordinating with soldiers under any circumstances is easy for me
ah well, that's, uh all in the past now
that was when ei began to change. makoto was her greatest loss.
i did consider that possibility, and i won't lie aeur" it'd be a real bummer if that were the case.
impressive. this courtyard is every bit as striking as the headquarters of the tenryou commission.
ayato told me that we've already confirmed the dates for some inazuma-fontaine cultural exchange events.
if i had to say one thing, it would be that the decorations are a little simple. it wouldn't hurt to consider adding more presentable articles of furniture.
this is your future that elio has foreseen. do you like it?
he also said that he will "take care of everything" before he leaves. what did he mean by that? we need to be extra careful when dealing with a person like him.
now, i'll press the advantage.
though i occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it aeur" i can't exactly avoid seeing it at the grand narukami shrine, after all aeur" my fate is intimately intertwined with the sacred sakura.
are any of the paths in this world easy to tread?
well, i guess i used to be more of a stickler for the rules.
you played the hand you were dealt masterfully. commendable.
phew it looks like i still have a long way to go.
it's a tiny robot? is it searching for something? but i don't remember mister svarog issuing an order like this recently
we'll see who wins next time. what do you say, miss "sole of the deep"? how about a rematch?
also, if we can leverage this opportunity to establish an amicable exchange with the xianzhou alliance, it may provide us with more bargaining power when dealing with the ipc.
okay. but before we move out, at least let me heal everyone with my dandelion breeze.
i also want to keep dancing with everyone else.
so if we were to build a trap together right now, what would you choose to build it with?
such a pity though as your friend, i respect your choice.
relax, i'm confident now. i don't even need to do the deep breathing exercises after all, we've already known each other for a long time now.
lynxy? she's more like me. ah, don't tell my brother that, he hates hearing it.
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
he was your tail for so many years, i'm sure he'd come back to say hi or bye.
don't worry, seele. like i said, it was just the exhaustion. svarog was deliberately holding back.
oh? well hello, what brings you to see me today?
after that well, some say the adventurers' guild has never accepted similar commissions ever since.
as for the context we'll need to sort that out a bit. hurry along now. recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
as the countdown began, he entered the tunnel.
hmm five days ago, you say
you think? i really like it. i'm not good at it though -- silver wolf always manages to guess right.
you intend to stop her achieving victory? i can't say i didn't expect that response from you. but i hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
your manifesto is very wide in its scope, but you don't seem to be personally involved in many of the specific fields. how can you be sure that you have the ability to put your plan into action?
gepard? not a chance he's a decent guy, but also famously uncompromising.
mister zubayr, i've finished tallying things up here! well, except for the guests
i believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his nameless friends. similarly, i'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
it appears so. we can't go on like this.
saika loves tricolor dango, but the adults in her family always scold her for eating too many and spoiling her appetite.
swords have a temper. sometimes, you have to touch them to calm them down -- put the hilt of the sword in your hand, and it'll tell you what's wrong!
who knows? cirrus said that luxie is kinda childlike -- it's worth a try.
another never-ending dawn. how bright is the day, and how long is the night.
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
my pops actually received a gift from one of his old customers over there. it was from the winery or something
it took some time, but the tenryou commission has assumed full control of this area. with all my heart, i thank the three of you for your assistance. your promised rewards are not forgotten.
you know better than i do. who watched the little songbird that couldn't sing perish right before their eyes? you did, blondie.
mister oswell? i thought you headed back home with mom. how come?
i dig jokes -- there's just too much sorrow and resentment in the world. sure, jokes won't make the world any better, but they don't make it any worse either.
i'd be really upset if you lost it.
(it'll probably still take some time, though. so, bear with me for now.)
it seems we were only a moment away from catching all the treasure hoarders
i did tell you to let me handle it. i don't have eyes in the back of my head -- what if i accidentally hit you?
okay, we don't have time to really look into it right now. let's strike while the iron is still hot, and wrap this thing up once and for all.
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
no, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. in the meantime, i'm sending someone i trust to go with you.
oh? i just received another message -- lemme see what kind of fun is inside this time!
my lady, if you went to port ormos in your current state, we'd both be in for a lifetime of trouble.
now that you mention it yes. we're being watched.
by the way, i've just noticed you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
she is captivated by something that has deeply mesmerized me.
until we're back in the overworld, i propose a temporary truce and cooperation. your true intentions are of interest to me
now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!
but for now, i have to stay home with my pops, so i won't be traveling far anytime soon.
hmm choose your words wisely, geppie
now, they're much further ahead in their studies and far more mature than their peers. this has given them confidence in themselves.
he goes by "blade" nowadays? a fitting name for someone who dedicated his mind and body to the ways of the sword.
shh, keep your voice down. don't let iwao and the others hear you.
ippei? is that someone from the tenryou commission?
welcome back. i appreciate your help more than i can express -- it couldn't have been easy running all over the city.
excellent, then let's start with the scenery shots. kamera and clapper loader, you're up.
silent but deadly are you sure that nickname isn't annoying you?
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
appearances can be deceiving. as i was examining the wall just now, i noticed there was something unusual about this stone.
yes, when the dust settles, i'll just think of a way to recall it in the memory zone.
i'm glad. the answer itself doesn't matter. what matters is that you've made a decision.
there are people born impoverished who don't know what hope is. there are also people born broken who do not know what it's like to be whole
the next time we encounter the dragon, how about we try talking to him instead of fighting?
hmm, i wouldn't want ordinary folks to become superstitious the less they know, the better.
ah her? how is this possible?
no, if it were only about revenge, they could just wreck the ship and destroy all the cargo, instead of allowing it to end up in the shackling prison.
nice answer. alright, next question
mines are our lifelines in the underworld. we have to keep providing geomarrow to the overworld in exchange for supplies.
i summed up my culinary requirements in four words. is that insufficiently simple for you?
you gave your medal to that kid eric. this thing might not be as valuable, but it's at least a replacement of sorts.
do you actually believe in the stellaron hunters' prophecy?
if you want to release a xiao lantern, come and find us anytime.
but their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. for example
there are all kinds of wonders in the universe -- you never know what you might find with a telescope.
i'm sure you've become acquainted with the general background of the moonchase festival. however, i have my own understanding of this festival's roots.
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
i can guess why: general feixiao is just too strong.
don't worry, you can leave such "boring" events to the grown-ups. i will attend the conference with welt. as for the three of you
all the painstaking effort that miss sparkle put into it -- how could i ever miss it?
i wouldn't say that -- a good businesswoman doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve. besides, the alliance has weathered plenty of challenges. we can handle this situation.
this sum was paid by northland bank, so they are still wary of me to this day.
so, i've always been curious about your sword -- how the weight is distributed, what material it's made of, whether it contains any special ingenia, and what kind of sword techniques you use
he didn't? that doesn't sound like the divine foresight i know.
finding balance is an essential concept in liyue culture.
well, this seems like a good moment for a break. take some time, and discuss what you want to do. let me know when you've made your decision.
i see. maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
lady yuheng said they're fortune coins. go on, give them a rub, it'll bring you good luck.
oh? what are you trying to say?
qianwei has many pioneering ideas, but some of his plans are lacking in detail, and he easily gets into testy exchanges with other people.
prior to the competition, the judges reviewed both contestants, and we can comfortably confirm that neither side is participating in a way that contravenes the competition rules.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go
if you want to know how to make money, i will honor our agreement and give you an answer. but that is not to say that it will work for you.
cloud knights! the borisin have arrogantly decided to challenge us on xianzhou territory! they vow that they will unleash a bloodbath along the streets of the xianzhou.
i'll have someone remove the explosives. then, there's someone i have to go and see.
the next time we have an important policy decision on our hands, i'd like you to get involved.
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
the members of swordfish ii are currently on standby in a valley to the southwest. ronin have been causing trouble down there lately, and we need a special operations unit to eliminate them and stabilize the rearguard.
besides the macaroni, i should also pick up some tomato sauce
to give a common example did you know that to varying degrees, most xianzhou natives are plagued by oral diseases and jaw-related conditions?
i was only out there a short time, so it wasn't too bad. but if one were to stay for any significant amount of time well, you can see how that boy is doing.
my meeting with ninja initiate gigaku was purely happenstance, but i did not come here alone. these nameless ninjas are also my companions.
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
that was her first experience with the "sky."
i see. perhaps the narration isn't engaging enough for you that's why you find it difficult to remember the key events.
alright, i'll help you out -- the first and last time the landau siblings will work together!
your recent feats have been doing the rounds, you know. in my brigade alone, a lot of people have been talking about the things you've achieved. i've even had several people ask me if i can introduce them to you.
this question surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us
i get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
woah, woah, woah. it's not like that, paimon!
without the sacred sakura, inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
still, i bet there's still a chance for kids like hook and clara, right? who knows, maybe they'll be able to represent belobog as it returns to the arms of the universe!
we have no means to wake them up now. not even your clockwork will do the trick.
i told you, i've incorporated dance into my swordplay. if you want to learn my sword techniques, you'll need to learn to dance first.
you guys didn't know? the wardance has a "popularity revival" rule. if eliminated contenders or teams garner enough popularity votes in online polls, they can participate in the repechage and re-enter the ring!
the first thought i have when things don't work out is to run away. starting from today, that's no longer the case.
quite a strong reaction this time. does this mean what he was really seeking was the mare jivari's location?
also, why use a spirit-duffer in that case? you're basically setting yourself up for failure.
i was just wondering who in their right mind would come out to a place like this. so, it's you two.
you're up next, little one. come on, sit yourself down here.
but really, i just want those marvels of weaponry to all have masters who treasure them rather than wield them with only brute strength.
still, if i back away from this and something happens to ororon, i would never forgive myself.
perhaps those garden folks lied to you. anyhow, i've looked up the name amphoreus in the simulated universe. though clearly irrelevant results have already been filtered out
one question per person, remember? the little one doesn't count.
even the toys he gave me would all be story props i'd get helmets, shields, and toy swords.
tch another sandstorm? what's up with these recently?
hey, you shouldn't be saying things like that.
this place is practically deserted what are they doing in a place like this?
these computers will get up to speed soon. now we're just one final step away from requesting an audience with droidhead.
alhaitham, do you stand by everything you just said?
elaborate a little on this "rock and a hard place" you're caught between?
perhaps you'll be the first guest to meet the dreammaster in years, mister yang.
let's start with the city's surroundings. we might be able to gather some clues by listening and observing.
people of belobog -- hear me!
the staff said that spectators would be less inclined to come if the contestants and commentators were all from the akademiya.
don't stop, don't turn back, don't look down. or up, for that matter.
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
those brilliant purple flowers became her dazzling stage. all the gods clamored, "oh, if only time could stop at this very moment."
hehe, that's for sure. and you know what? the way i see it, the museum's reopening is a very significant event and worth remembering more than any other time in the past.
traveler, please escort the treasure hoarders back to qingce village and hand them over to the millelith stationed there.
alright then. feel free to take a look around the venue before it kicks off.
is this treasure really more important to you than bringing peace to the kingdom?
something small, i suppose. we have to hit the road again after we eat. beyond that, anything goes.
also i am the only one out of all of us who could know what it would look like. to me, that confirms that this place really is reading our minds.
it would seem that there has been a misunderstanding. to be clear, the raising of both hands is not always an indication of surrender
later on, i also sensed something similar around timaeus, so i made another one, and left it at scent of spring.
hey! are you trying to back out before you even hit the arena? hello, we are both wardance competitors.
it sounds bizarre, but it could be a clue. i'll jot it down.
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
i, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. so, i will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
the general sent for craftsmen, and they concluded that the sound came from the shipyard facilities in stargazer navalia.
well, you see we are the ones that owe an explanation. if we keep putting off the meeting, it could easily result in the problem escalating, right?
dear guests, if you would, i'd like you to please follow me
this place is an endless stream of people where do we start?
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
before you lies a serene stretch of open water, its surface shimmering a brilliant shade of sapphire blue.
why don't we flip the question and start by asking who couldn't be the murderer? after all, there are only three suspects, so elimination could be a valid method.
do you not know how to wield a blade? or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
tell the truth and i might go easy on you.
in other words, you and i are each other's destiny.
i found him unapproachable at first, too. but i believe that being able to face him is an important part of my "homecoming."
it actually doesn't matter what i do. what matters are the people i work with. when i'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. talking to you never gets old, after all.
some people here say they saw him. guess he stood out as an older guy heading into the desert alone, with just a sumpter beast in tow, and very few supplies
i didn't mean it that way. since you've already drawn your swords, you'd be disappointed if you didn't get to test one another, right?
she is your sister, after all.
pengyi, go back to liyue harbor and get the fireworks ready, then meet me in qingce village.
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here mind if we ask you a few questions?
not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the penacony grand theater has now moved to the radiant feldspar -- the very airship you all stand upon.
i was born into a humble family, and all the wealth you see now began with a single haul of fish.
therefore i shall allow you to leave tenshukaku alive
oh, you're here already? sorry to keep you waiting. madam yukong is expecting you.
but from now on, i want to spend my time learning real stories about real people, and how they touch the lives of others around them.
sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. you two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
alright. goodbye then, urakusai.
a handwritten copy of a storybook the paper's already yellowed, and it looks like it's about to fall apart
managing a successful business is not as simple as you might think. capital, connections, sensitivity to the trends, an instinct for what is a good opportunity all of these traits are crucial.
every time i heard that her experiments failed, i'd rush over asap and congratulate her with utmost sincerity aeur" there's nothing more precious than failures for a genius.
just focus on your teaching. why bring me into this?
mmm you have surpassed my expectations again.
besides, if we fail to uncover what's really going on in this tournament, we simply leave haniyyah to her own devices who knows what chaos might ensue.
the longest-serving general of the xianzhou luofu. do you think he'd have only a few enemies?
penacony, the land of the dreams is this truly the paradise you desire?
i understand, but i must protect those that believe in the architects
behold, the winner of the "most awesome researcher" contest.
let's go somewhere the akademiya can't find us and perform there ahh, but how do we let everyone know and what about the atmosphere and the stage
there are thirty-two versions of my full name circulating among the troops. how do i know? i'm an intelligence officer after all.
oh, i could hear you. i just have a habit of being silent while i'm watching fireworks.
i understand now when you saw that carving, you were reminded of your friend.
there we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
ah, sorry to hear that. i'll be sure to bring him some great liquor next time i left in a hurry, and i couldn't make it back in time for the event.
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
first, the disciples of sanctus medicus grew uninterrupted on the luofu, yet the six charioteers were not aware of it. that was a dereliction of duty.
um this gentleman is?
alright, cloud retainer it is.
i've seen some strange things here, too. objects that shouldn't be here, strange figures appearing then vanishing i don't think any of it's real.
perhaps the subsequent data will be able to tell us why he arrived on the xianzhou. we'll contact you if there are any new findings.
and these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
kouichi! i'm here, how is the boat coming along?
this show will be a special one. we're holding it in cesar's honor.
let's just stop wasting time. just treat us to some milk tea, and then we can start our real swordplay training, okay?
oh! greetings to you too. i have a design here for a garment, would you be so kind as to take a look?
if we manage to convince her, i'm quite sure we'll be able to get you another audience with the raiden shogun.
but you cannot run from combat, dan heng. your spearmanship is identical to imbibitor lunae's.
mmm what's this little device here for? could you please let me know? it looks like a little button.
that's the most important outcome of this trip. to be honest, i wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when i lent you the pass permit.
it looks like we're all here. well then, time for me to announce the results of the assessment process.
sweets always make you feel better! most people in sumeru love them. wanna try some? i'll get some for you!
do you remember what dugu shuo said about zhiyi's stories? clearly they left him with a good impression of the guy, but beyond that he wasn't interested in the details. that's the reaction i would expect from any normal person.
you you just won't stop haunting me.
now that you know what to do, why not give it a go? i'll be right here, waiting for you.
"square meals in the basement: big bowls of rice, decorate with cuboids of meat."
master xingqiu, i would like to borrow a few of your staff to escort the thief to the ministry of civil affairs. as for the bounty, we will pay you afterward.
yes, i grew up here, listening to the sound of waves while researching prescriptions with my mentors and peers at the alchemy commission.
oh? well what did you want to ask?
since you're back, i take it that the ronin are now gone from watatsumi island?
he has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
don't worry, i wasn't angry. i was just trying to distract her.
it seems like i've underestimated the popularity of this game. hmm i suppose this calls for a few more volumes of "king of invokations"
us mercs, on the other hand we pretty much live from one day to the next.
next, i'll be introducing the history of the museum. everyone, listen carefully, okay?
like the time guinaifen dragged me to fyxestroll garden so i could protect her, but i was so scared i ended up fainting
i heard that in liyue, the biggest compliment you can pay to the chef is to leave a clean plate. it's delicious, thank you ever so much.
what is this? a brooch?
bronya! i don't know what happened between you and them. even if you explained it to me, i probably wouldn't understand all the crazy details. but there are two things i do know
our responsibility is to get a status update on the fatui harbinger known as the doctor. we need to make sure he won't get in our way when we rescue lesser lord kusanali.
maybe there's more to it? it's not like i would know, i'm a mere amicassador.
no, you just have to be clear on what you should do.
i came up with the design, but i was never able to build it -- some of the raw materials were either too expensive or too hard to get a hold of. she helped me turn the concept into reality.
if i'd asked you to tail uncle tian, you'd have ended up at a dead end, too. it's fine. so, where did you lose him?
mavuika knows about all this, doesn't she?
lyney's still talking to the gardes. it seems he'll have a lot of explaining to do
oh, there was a girl and her brother who said you saved their lives. you might want to check on them and see how they're doing.
...but to inspire them to save themselves.
these soldiers are fully armed. obviously, they didn't hastily join the battle.
we wouldn't have crossed paths.
hehe, don't worry. if he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
by making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
i've never been great at maintaining relationships. besides, anyone i've ever worked with probably couldn't wait to get rid of me
upon starting my military career, i made a pledge that the rest of my life would be dedicated to being the xianzhou's spearhead, hunting down the abominations of abundance till the end of my days.
it's not my fault that i'm super popular! what was that saying again? my popularity hasaeur"
if we hadn't happened to be passing by were you really planning to go into the fragmentum alone?
i can't believe you actually got so many eremites into sumeru city!
the shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. the question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
hm. so, a dramatic debut?
in the hands of a professional businessperson, the kind of information you will be exposed to would be worth well, tens of millions of mora.
but if we wish to mount any sizable resistance against the vision hunt decree there is still much to be done.
i really hope the museum can open up soon the children here need a culturally-enriching environment -- especially those from the underworld
in my opinion, there is no murderer for this case.
don't give me that! i checked the records here. you didn't take any cases.
a lot which is why wildfire has never been able to take him down. svarog's forces are too strong. we don't have enough firepower.
ah, lisa. the grand master's letter is just on the table.
"outlander brigade: when the wind of death blew towards the blond samurai"? what a long name must be a new one, i've never heard of it.
fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
would you be willing to help the tenryou commission one final time?
you should thank the traveler this time, doushin shikanoin. otherwise, i don't think i would have let you off so easily.
because i had just severed ties with a lifelong companion.
do you mean ping might find the topic too distressing?
the way it looks to me is that shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. would you mind telling me what that's all about?
if you encounter any troubles along your journey, you need only let us know, no matter the distance between us.
you look like you're raring to go. not surprising, given how comfy this place is. i slept like a log last night.
no matter what happens, we'll stand as one.
perhaps it's because i'm the electro archon's familiar.
exactly, a rule of the silvermane guards. don't apply your rules to us.
we're lucky that no one from the tenryou commission was around, otherwise, we'd all be in big trouble.
how many more of your comrades are here? where were you planning to meet hoolay?
is following girls around like a lost puppy your way of getting their attention? you've been doing this for nearly half a system hour.
"the stars exploded, and the express has to go everywhere to pick up all the pieces, and that's why it flies up in the sky."
i just got a whiff of it, and it woke me right up. it smells like medicine brewed by the alchemy commission!
and messing with my precious audience system is just a ruse to lure me here so i can lead you to them
rejected. you failed to inform the gm of this course of action. moreover, the guards would have conducted a thorough search before throwing you in prison.
actually, i have another selfish motive i want to prove to cocolia that i was right. once we've taken care of the stellaron maybe she'll go back to how she was.
y'know, you're getting less silent and more deadly by the minute! sounds good, let's get it!
sorry, please keep still for a moment
i think i'll stay behind. that way, if something does go wrong, you'll have someone on the ground to get you some help.
of course heh, you didn't see the look on joshua's face. he could barely hold back his tears.
because in the next few centuries, visually impaired people like us will continue to require help from everyone we meet.
with my words, xinyan's chords, and yun jin as our mentor
such a direct act of provocation is enough to get my competitive side worked up too.
however, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
ha that i don't know. which is why i'm gearing up to solve this mystery.
which would mean you'd caused me even more trouble my vengeance would be swifter still!
once we've returned the goods, we'll find the owner of the house, and you can apologize to them in person. after that, i'll escort you to the ministry of civil affairs.
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
i'll leave negotiations to you guys. they're not my strong point.
i don't want you to feel burdened by this choice... you don't need to worry about my feelings, just go with what your heart tells you.
on my flying ability, i'm afraid i'll have to disappoint you, mister yang. the sky no longer suits me.
i see. no wonder those assistananas only want to teach students one on one
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
straight to the point. i like it.
what happened to that confidence of yours?
how could he ever even dream of acting against the shogun?
i have no experience in this matter. i'm not entirely sure if i'm qualified to be a pet's "master."
since you asked one of the three questions, it means everything is going smoothly. are you ready to hear my answer?
okay, now answer me honestly were you the one who helped the captain escape after his battle with the pyro archon?
i still have no further leads regarding the issue of potential collusion between the tenryou commission and the fatui.
yes. what is making her so nervous?
however, if you were to use "dear friend" to address an intimate friend, the recipient would think that you were deliberately trying to estrange them.
wait, when did this happen exactly?
can a creation become what it wants to be? the answer is "yes"! i'll grant your wish, guyun, and transform you into something different.
hmm? is something else wrong?
just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
now that the stellaron crisis is over, we've been able to allocate more manpower to the renovation works. the museum should be open to the public again soon.
doushin shikanoin, i see you've finally returned. please, enlighten us, what have you been doing recently?
my strategies and my deck are at the ready. let us begin.
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
hardships are a fact of life, both for the adepti and humans alike.
that's the only way to ensure that we have a fair fight, don't you think? i don't want to see you go and lose to someone else, after all.
for now, all we can share with you is that your friend cyno is working with us.
now that i know the truth there is a certain sweetness to the scenery all around us.
march, there is no such thing as completely ready.
hmm, an underground space with an entrance but no exit it just doesn't make any sense. i'll figure something out, just give me some time.
uh about that well i sold it 'cause i was low on mora. stuff like this happens every now and then.
but after the almighty shogun's loss, i'm afraid that lady guuji may also have caught wind of kokomi's strategies.
we predict their next move, and we take them down.
the ocean really is beautiful at night
okay, let's see what there is.
is that hesitation that i detect in your voice? so let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, i actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
purified filth quickly dissipates and will be absorbed by the ley lines shortly afterwards. in other words, it cannot exist for too long.
we must be close i wonder who she is?
for a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the tenryou commission is nigh on impossible.
i considered this matter worthy of my attention. so i pursued them, and they led me here, where i happened to run into you.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too and, who is that over there?
see, there's a piece of paper here! it says "penya sergeyevna"
looks like nothing can be found here.
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
all we need to do is bring those disillusioned fans back to their senses to quell the rogue waves of fiendlings.
thank you! as appreciation, i'd like to give you a token gift.
as i am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. that is the nature of liyue.
just play a round with her -- i doubt she'll let go of this chance to boast about it.
i just wish i could have done more. so many souls, and i could barely help. i'm so sorry
liyue harbor is always changing, so it is only fitting that lantern rite should change in turn.
yeah surely we've earned it?
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again
it really seems like something that was thrown together rather quickly. its creator most likely didn't consider whether the system would function properly or not
to be honest, i feel the same way.
it's the first time i've ever invited so many exceptional people to one place. i was a little nervous myself.
i just hope you'll pick up some useful skills this time. oh, and stop trying to "persuade" every animal you come across
i think i already see you two as people of the grand bazaar. yep, without a doubt.
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
hehe, i understand how you feel! back at the grand bazaar, zubayr theater's always busy with rehearsals too.
come on, how could i possibly lose?
plus there's the fact that all this praise of zhiyi has only been happening within the last two or three months.
"the simulated universe is bound to make errors." you said that yourself, and that's exactly what we're experiencing. why is it a problem all of a sudden?
so in the vast majority of cases, the one he made tea for was the former electro archon who was also my sister. raiden makoto.
as well as traveling with the caravans to ensure essential goods are delivered without incident, we have to investigate suspicious locations to eliminate any emerging threats.
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge
is it me or is it cold here?
i understand. you helped a lot of injured people in the mine, and you risked going into the town for supplies. you're good people.
hehe. come, let's pay a visit to the venue in ritou together. i promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
descendant of the takatsukasa clan. explain what is going on here.
regarding the recent mishap i understand it negatively impacted some of our guests. as a member of the family, it's only right for me to come forward and offer my apologies to everyone.
she suddenly disappeared the night i turned ten years old.
i've made it this far in life without a single drop of my father's support.
the deadline is looming i'm counting on you.
exactly. madam yukong would never allow malicious competition. if we hadn't taught skott a lesson, the sky-faring commission would have done so anyway.
hmm this area is sheltered and facing the sun, plus it's flat ground, but
all i know is that despite being custom-made, they are not particularly exquisite aeur" if they were, you can be sure i would have purchased one sooner.
hee-hee, i like your sense of humor, benefactors. of course i'm happy to see you! when things settle down, i might even get promoted for catching a stellaron hunter.
they don't seem to care much about "death"... instead, they're more concerned about the charmony festival and the watchmaker.
hey, not everything can be solved with food!
how about we check out spina di rosula's ship? we should have a view of the whole of poisson from there.
they rely on me, accept me, and long for me to bear witness to their stories.
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
now that i think about it, perhaps i never needed to recommend that store to you in the first place.
he was the same way toward me and amber at first. as we gradually got to know each other, he started acting more naturally.
mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
exactly. the evidence will soon be blown away by the wind, so it's nothing we can arrest anyone with.
the charmony festival will start soon. there's one thing that... i need to confirm no matter what. a warp jump is the best way to do so.
why are there seven people all striving to have a relationship with a single male protagonist? is this some sort of narrative device, too?
it also gives inayah shelter from her family it has brought us together after taking care of every single one of us.
let's light them up! look! aren't they nice!
even with two demigods protecting the holy city, the risk is too great. hence
if you must know, it's a little complicated but simply put, i'm searching for a cousin of mine from the lawrence clan.
anyway. i'm sure tsuyuko will have told you that the watatsumi goryou matsuri is a ceremony to reverse the holy soil phenomenon on watatsumi island.
general jing yuan?
that thought has filled me with sorrow, as if a piece of my life had been stolen away, and i had no part in it.
look over there, that's the ring we'll be standing on.
xiao is not here, but
with this, the debt between the traveling merchant and me is clear.
of course, if you want to get to the nitty-gritty, it's not that simple this project has encountered plenty of hiccups along the way. it wasn't all smooth sailing.
oh? is that so? well, since you are testifying for him, i suppose i won't ask any more questions
the situation gets more interesting with each development blitzara injured pyro-one soon after the match started, and haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
knight of beauty, you're the one who stole guyun, right? hand it over! you have no idea how dangerous that cursed sword is.
no, it seemed more sportsmanlike than that.
phainon, will you fulfill your duty as host and look after our distinguished guests?
also, i--it's not like i'm never coming back. and if i really miss him i can just pester the heck outta him over the phone, right?
still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
heh, either way, i'm not here to twist your arm. you needn't worry.
you should go with them. it can only help with your recovery to hear more about your past.
how do you feel? are you happy with your new appearance?
you think so? i thought i was rather accommodating. if it had been the shogun she would have decapitated kujou kamaji without a second thought.
its formal name is the "mechanism energy hub." it's connected to all the energy lines -- i would've thought it covers the entire restricted zone.
but you can't bring yourself to do that, can you? you care too much about director aurelie and the home she built you all to let go.
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express?
i thought this is just the kind of thing that'd get written into your "script".
you can stop gathering parts for the time being. just stay here and wait for us to return and give you your next orders, alright?
our memories don't just symbolize our past. they can also shine a light on our future.
i guess once things settle down, i can spare a moment to contemplate the stars.
so, this must be an adepti abode hmm, though it's a bit different from what i imagined, it's still most fascinating.
yes, the mara in you is temporarily suppressed. so long as you avoid over-stimulation and familiar faces, you shouldn't have a problem.
on the xianzhou, short-life species like us have a fleeting existence, here one moment and gone the next. that's all the more reason to seize the moment while you still have it!
is it alright if i poke your forehead? just gently, i mean. i heard it helps people have good dreams.
give precious things to the "greedy spirit" in the sea is that what we have to do?
alright then. your turn now, my little friend. toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
candace is an expert at dealing with people like this. all we have to do is wait for her word.
as well as being willing, they would need to be an early riser and also tall enough to beat the crowds to the top-shelf items
i'm going to head back and make some preparations. meet me outside the yae publishing house.
we have already rooted out those behind the resistance. all who have dishonored the almighty shogun will be punished.
i'm sure jarilo-vi won't be the only planet to have ipc visitors, but i bet not all of them will have a visitor like topaz
but i thought all of you akademiya big-shots were great speakers?
hah, you're absolutely right. perhaps they occasionally best the shogun's army in open battle, but when they face the raiden shogun herself
my dear people. whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, i say to you aeur" keep faith in your ardor for justice!
rather than worrying about them, we should worry about my brother first.
hmm. well, confidence is an essential trait for a good chef. he must be an excellent cook.
rest in the grasp of its people or yours, elder caenis?
hehe, now we're talking like a serious acting troupe!
oh, good morning, traveler. whenever i see you in the morning, somehow, it makes me feel like today is going to be a good day.
who's there? didn't your parents tell you to knock before--
whatever else uncle tian might think of zhiyi, the fact remains that he's one of his favorite students.
representatives of all parties, please be ready to brief the review committee on your business plans.
ah, so you probably got there after us
you're still talking big but sure, if that happens, i'll stay true to my word.
this all feels very suspicious. there must be more to this than he is letting on.
the luofu really is a bit conservative. if we encountered a heliobus on the zhuming that was this capable and had no harmful intentions, we would definitely not seal it up.
there's no reason to be upset by this. time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. so, you must be happy in the present. you should understand what i mean now.
your confidence actually makes me even more worried this isn't like helping a child make a snowball.
speaking of traveler, what do you think of the resistance army's chances?
good, i've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the underworld.
ohaeur" hello, i'm ganyu. i work at yujing terrace. i've heard that you've returned to liyue harbor recently, so if you need anything, please feel free to come to me.
i know they're wary of me, but this is still an overreaction, surely
go and rest. i will stay here and keep watch.
imagination is the source of all existence. children need only their imagination to understand the express.
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to
here we are. this is the yae publishing house.
hey, silent but deadly, shout if you see any danger, okay? don't think just because you know a move or two you can charge off by yourself!
ah c'mon, no need to get all serious. just buy a round of drinks next time we're all in the city, or something.
yes. plus, she'll definitely want to hear how the end of the show went
huh? but i thought she wore the funeral parlor uniform with the harmony hexagram hat?
oh? surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
you left all your subordinates back there to guard the road, making sure no one else followed you here. seems to me like you were hoping for a chance to talk.
while i'm idling time on admiring the scenery, the spectacled snake-bedecked doc's doing surgery
i'll lead the way. you two keep an eye on our surroundings.
later, the master told me that i was one of the best mercenaries he'd ever seen, and that i should stick around to become one of his bodyguards.
thaeur"then, may i ask some questions? in my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things
if what mister norbert said is true, then our safest option is to send a civilian to try to reach out to mister cold feet and lure him out of his lair.
you mean the "academic fraud" mister reca mentioned? i can't believe that sort of thing happens in paperfold university, too.
not to mention, forty-five system hours ago a stellaron burst occurred on the luofu.
i prefer to make friends by sparring -- after all, combat is more sincere than words. that carefree general of the yaoqing is the same as me in that regard.
no need. this is merely a memokeeper's duty.
now can you tell us what really happened to aurum alley?
just be grateful that the "little brat" showed you mercy. at least your staff aren't seriously injured.
the guard over there said that i needed an "encryption key" to open the gate. can you help me out?
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
thank you. i was really delighted to learn that you also entered the competition
hey, you two! cat got your tongue or something? if you knew what was best for you, you'd get out of my way!
the three zones are compartmentalized, so we're going to have to troubleshoot them one at a time. let's start with the energy supply zone. get ready, and then we'll go over.
alright, alright, stop with the tantrum. you're not a kid anymore.
given our limited life spans, the only ones who place value on ceremony are us foxians.
"it is a beautiful thing born from our life experiences. whenever there is joy or something to be celebrated, people will dance."
i'm sorry, i have something important to do right now. i'll be back later on.
he's actually explaining his joke!
careful, these traces are fresh. our unsought guest isn't far away.
i will, ganyu has always been a great asset to us. her health is a priority, so i will take good care of her.
but as you can see, sir, no innocent bystanders were affected in this incident.
parting with a friend like that is too sad, and she never wanted that to happen.
huh, i'm surprised you managed to track it down after all this time.
straight to the point, i see. works for me.
i would ask: would you still embark on this journey?
but if this went on forever would it get boring too?
uh kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
so it can only mean that you are happy to see me again. you have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
because of the nihility, i'm rarely affected by the power of other paths, but somehow i can unconsciously infiltrate them... maybe that's the "risk" they're trying to avoid.
don't look down on me just because i'm a new recruit~
i am not without my doubts but watatsumi island is hardly affluent, and these supplies are a much-needed lifeline for us.
i'm also keen to lay eyes on this so-called dodo-king. all of you, follow me. let's investigate.
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
back in the day, i had to hurry home after work to do my household chores. then in the evening, it was out to the night market with the family to support our stall.
okay, so i guess that means it's time to say goodnight now.
do you two still remember what it was like when you first saw me?
but it happens. battles are complex things and the situation evolves constantly. it doesn't always help to stick too rigidly to a predetermined plan.
there's something i need your help with -- i had to make it up to you somehow.
thank you for enlightening me. was it for the same reason that you "traded off" my mentor to the xianzhou zhuming, only to stand idle and allow the resurgence of the disciples of sanctus medicus?
is that it? i thought you were gonna stay for at least a little longer
that's exactly why my people turned to "vessels" like ororon.
in any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
i'm done making excuses for him. he's not a child anymore. he needs to take responsibility for his actions.
let's go. if my hunch is correct, we just might hit the jackpot this time.
this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
that makes sense. with such a long life, the grand craftsman can't remember every single item he's made. is there another way?
hmm not bad. sounds like something one of those old bands would play at the beginning of their sets
these are the remains of assassins who used cloudhymn magic to conceal their tracks. they aided in the borisin's escape, allowing them unimpeded passage through the shackling prison.
put it like this aeur" my grandpa makes a living telling fortunes in yilong wharf, but i'm making more than him just selling my handmade arts and crafts.
"unlikely, potential" meaning there could still be conflicts
i've begun to realize that the sages are behind everything that's happened recently. the radicals' blind belief in king deshret, making the dendro archon out to be an enemy it's all the akademiya's trickery.
until the bids exceed the value of the item you're after, you can keep raising the price. if the bids go beyond what you can accept, then you let someone else take it.
well let's see. ah, yes -- a silvermane guard standard issue portable heater. i--it's broken, though.
oh, did i mention? ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the grand narukami shrine.
hello there, everyone. i heard you were working on the piping for the calligraphy tavern. is there anything we can do to help?
this is indeed a mysterious case.
but it was the dandelion knight that represented her hopes for the future aeur" a future belonging to the newly formed knights of favonius
fortunately, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario thanks to the help of heroic individuals such as yourselves.
you're too kind. my brother and i simply go where we must to fulfill our duties.
i want to take a risky job and put my body to the test again.
good. then i'm free to alter the script as i see fit?
huh, really? oh, you probably mean because all the gods in this story are no longer alive.
if i can pass on everything i have learned, i can create a legacy that will live on long after i am gone.
ah i take it you're inazuman, then, miss kirara?
nice, you guys are bringing the heat! can you go one better?
something strange? can you share any details?
wait a sec you sure that's the latest style? that sounds a lot like what the older folks back home would wear
yes. to become fond of a place, to feel part of it it always requires a reason.
yeah, i guess you could say that. they've always seen us as being meaningless.
anyway, i was also woken up by the commotion. looks like all the warriors from the stadium are on the move.
right, the same as what mister khasani believes.
hmm. even the pin connecting the body to the chassis is broken, not to mention the rear wheelset bearing. this looks like the work of svarog's minions.
huohuo has been browsing ghostly grove for hours. every time she finds a suspicious incident, she says: "do you think tail did this?"
you know, it's common courtesy to make sure the homeowner isn't in earshot when you're denigrating their abode.
i didn't expect to meet a fan here. i'm honored. welcome to penacony, a world filled with wonderful dreams.
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
after ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
she told me that you salvaged the forgotten hall's memories with great skill, that you are a rare talent.
for long-life species, such events are more like yesterday's memories than ancient history. this awful spectacle is child's play in comparison.
and you will die. i mean... all of you will.
perfect! okay, we need to get to the front line.
didn't expect those pooches to actually recycle them all
that's what i'm saying! at first, sushang didn't believe that fyxestroll garden was haunted. but after the judges showed up
in his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. that would be the best place for him to go. so that will also be our final battlefield.
i'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *primal dreamscape*. how lucky.
anyways, the higher-ups didn't say anything. they just got me to come evacuate the civilians in cloudford.
belobog oh! i think lil gui mentioned it before, but i can't seem to remember. what kind of place is it?
dunyarzad, let me show you which stage decorations we've picked out so far. traveler and paimon, if that doesn't sound interesting to you, then feel free to explore the area.
if you have any more questions, just ask uncle tian. after the recent turn of events i'd say he owes you one, wouldn't you?
is there still anything unresolved or strange that we should try to consider?
is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
unfortunately, given that said antagonist is under the protection of two commissions and the raiden shogun, we would be rather hard-pressed to track them down.
the marechaussee phantom found bonnie and the lefevere pendant at pierre's residence. that was the beginning point of our investigation.
starting from mondstadt, to liyue, and then to inazuma i will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
didn't little yanqing claim that he was going to give up being the ringmaster and go on the hunt instead? help shoulder the general's burdens?
if you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
and yet, the outcome is quite satisfactory. a testament to your ability and willingness to adapt.
go on. open it up, show me what's inside.
hehe before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
and if you're feeling a little tired, lie down on the seats instead. the universe is fascinating from every angle.
all you did was chop down a few monsters. don't get carried away with yourself.
my existence, hmm
liquor and wineware i see. let's go.
but he is very proud and incredibly stubborn. he doesn't care much about other people's feelings.
those choices may be correct and far-sighted, but we are, after all, flesh and blood, and we cannot help but agonize over the process of making them.
wait, gepard! listen to me--
there's gotta be a better shot than this one!
i bet the letter's at the reception desk. i'll go check later.
it's really easy -- see this chandelier? next we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
that's settled then. i'll leave nat to you. remember to keep the secret -- for bron-- no, for belobog's sake.
no, i'm aware of your strength, traveler. the power hidden within you is not inferior to mine.
yancui has agreed to offer you free meals throughout the crossover.
the devorator would be a formidable adversary for any mortal being, even ones as capable as the hunters.
i... have some unfinished business.
and so, the monsters were eradicated, and the sorcerer was defeated.
all right. drift peacefully off to sleep, and i'll be right with you.
every once in a while, i'll need them to get me things from other planets, and they often come to me to help them solve problems.
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans)
my body feels strange
trust me, you don't want to know the cost of betraying me. just think of the things i said to you as our little secret. understood?
an interesting answer. but if you ask me, i think all emotion shall ultimately return home to the heart, and slowly settle with the passage of time.
i'm just bubbling with energy we'll make a formidable force in our next fight.
for a human soul, to lose the boundaries of the mind is to drown in the sea of consciousness without a concept of self
yeah... we need to find arlan quickly. i need to apologize to him in person!
alright. well, i'll leave the decision to you.
anti-raiden shogun training. i've prepared a special program, just for you. come along now.
lots of children grow up learning to use a sword on the luofu, but for a child to be walking around with one
you are a high-profile figure within the knights of favonius. as his commanding officer, i have a duty to make sure no misunderstandings arise between you.
enough talk, you're coming with me. chief oleg wants to see you, and he's got more than a few questions.
okay, let's get moving. we should head back to the village and rest up. today was just a trial run aeur" noon tomorrow is gonna be the hard part.
they must have fallen down here with us. pretty lucky if you ask me.
seeing as you're right here in front of me like this, then i guess the answer is "a trashcan," right?
for your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
wow, i've never seen anything like this before! it's so much more spectacular than the little plaza in exalting sanctum.
it's a pity that we haven't had the chance to talk much, and now the express is about to leave. do you have any questions?
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
the sofa is so soft
indeed. this means that these borisin have a steady supply of the medicine within the luofu.
okay thanks, linlang. seems there's a little more to buying wineware than i first thought. we'll have to mull it over.
i'm not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that's my take on the matter.
that's right. my people are busy collecting clues now. what's the situation, moze?
i prefer snacks to entrees. i always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as i go. by the way, are you any good at making snacks? i'll trade the dango i made with you. here, have the big ones!
well, this is a complex and evolving situation, so we should be ready for any eventuality. for security reasons, we changed back into more combat-ready attire.
rex lapis' death is indeed an extraordinary circumstance. but to think that they would call for a council of adepti rather than come down here directly
he was left on a rock in the wilderness, his parentage completely unknown. it's a miracle he wasn't devoured by some wild beast.
tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave shingo's body. then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
how much longer can you last with your current supplies?
alright, i have to bring all of this to mister zubayr and do a little bit of prep.
i was initially skeptical about the vidyadhara's betrayal of the alliance but after hearing your confession, i realize that there is no point in talking about trust.
i thought it would turn out poorly because i felt rather rigid. but it actually looks much more natural than i'd imagined.
forget that, there's no time. right now, we need to inform the whole army to cease using their delusions immediately.
hmm quite impressive.
i suggest that you make some concessions to appease the merchants. if you don't follow mingxi's plans for the dock, she will temporarily take over your position.
readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. if we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
i huh. y'know, the more i think about it, the more it seems deliberate.
let's go. we need to get to the wardance ring!
the spells of the masters of the night-wind are all based on dealing with spirits, and so are all our problem-solving methods. so for spirit-duffers, even our healing methods don't work on them.
you carry yourself with such dignity and grace, but you still have the heart of a child. lady bailu loves these types of accessories. let's go with your suggestion.
let's hurry back to fyxestroll garden now, while there's still a chance to turn things around. it's time to teach cirrus a lesson.
the dye was modified using a secret technique to harness the power of memories and create mazes like the one we just witnessed.
don't let it get you down -- you can share your feelings with others y'know? do you think keeping it all to yourself is doing you any good?
i've even thought of the design already, but it's a secret! then it'll be a surprise the next time we meet! don't you think so?
why don't you skip all this rigmarole and just have a heart-to-heart conversation with me? it might tickle a little.
sometimes i stand at the door of the clinic and watch her running and jumping around and my tiredness simply goes away.
my lady has been very energetic lately and keeps taking me on hikes, staying out even into the night. by the time we get back, the receptionist is usually off napping on the job.
however, your zealousness inhibits your ability to hide your line of attack.
i haven't fought with gepard since he enlisted. he could never beat me when we were little, but now
clara had already arrived at the storage room by the time we got there. we split the painkillers with her.
you know, the earliest shrine on watatsumi island was not located in sangonomiya.
haha, the enthusiasm is cute, but don't think just because you're still figuring out the game that pela and i will take it easy on you!
nice idea, i think we can all commit to writing a note. we'll see what we can come up with.
hmm, how much do i want? hey, how about paying me with a smile, whaddya say?
water continues to drip from the ceiling. in this lightless dungeon, you lack a reliable way to tell how much time has passed.
so you're looking after your brother on your own? that must be hard.
i'm entrusting you not only with the honor of the ring, but also with the security of the skysplitter.
perfect timing. wenyuan just sent word that the fatui ambassador, yusupov, just left the embassy alone. he's heading in the direction of qingxu pool.
and now, i will reclaim everything i have lost. and it should begin with a proper acknowledgment--
since i do rock 'n' roll full-time, i'd say my hobby is work? what's wrong with that?
of five people, three must pay a price.
we bear responsibility for this issue.
anyway, looks like we're done with business here. traveler, lend me a hand. let's tie 'em up and bring 'em to the village.
really? you're gonna say yes just like that?
"the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen"...
master of inazuma kamisato art tachi jutsu aeur" kamisato ayaka, present!delighted to make your acquaintance.
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
all of this was so encouraging to hear. it made me feel that my dear old companion's sacrifice was not in vain.
it's finally time to get back to bed. goodbye, everyone.
that's wonderful. i'll be looking forward to your cooking during our adventures together.
this is forbidden territory which can never be ventured into.
the duty of a tengu warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the kujou clan is to guard inazuma. these two are of the same ilk.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express
so much energy seriously, what's her secret?
she mentioned that this transaction involves the watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
uh, sorry all cloud knights answer to the ten-lords commission. duty calls
it sure is but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
i've never heard of the golden apple archipelago. where is it?
still, i take the fact that so many people are turning to us for assistance as a sign that the tenryou commission is gradually regaining the people's trust.
those sages really have some nerve. five hundred years ago, lesser lord kusanali used all her power for the people of sumeru, and what did they do in return?
thank you. you must have put a lot of love and effort into this dish, just like i put so much of me into my dance practice.
and you likely wouldn't be willing to buy them, either.
even though it ended up causing everyone a whole lot of trouble, thankfully, everything worked out in the end.
it's a good idea, but which one of us could hope to win against a researcher?
think about it, though. what's your reputation worth if you won't have the other tools you need to succeed in this line of work? tools like, i dunno your limbs, or eyes?
anyway. this may add to the debt of gratitude i owe you, but the fact is, your arrival here has rescued what was fast becoming a rather dire situation indeed.
everyone, we meet again.
this really took a lot out of me, though. i don't ever wanna do this again
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
it's futile trying to escape. anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. after all you did summon it together.
that was when i saw you. you didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
i've got a spice-trading deal from another nation i thought maybe delavar and his friends might be interested. know where i could find him?
ah, i don't intend to spoil the fun. sometimes, protecting dreams and fantasies is more important than exposing the truth, don't you think?
with so many competitors in this line of work, laziness will only net you an empty stomach.
ahh! okay, it's about time i headed back. the naganohara fireworks show is just around the corner, and there's still a lot of things to get ready.
it's a relief to see you safe and sound, miss robin.
why are you so interested in it?
yes, it is an interest of mine.
i'll take some samples for the alchemists to analyze and figure out where the biological tissue comes from.
long the permanence, idrila the beauty, ena the order, tayzzyronth the propagation akivili the trailblaze.
really? so i don't even need to write a resignation letter?
don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
i trust you saw this year's mingxiao lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
so how about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? i'm quite eager to have it back.
dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
miss dunyarzad she's lying down here, isn't she? how's she doing?
then it'll be time for me and my stowaway brothers to shine.
the sacred sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously i get to prune it exactly how i like it.
they say it will suffice. experiencing the bizarre and motley dreamscape is the best reward.
that's why he joined wangsheng funeral parlor. in place of a salary, i'm helping him deal with this matter.
oh, sorry. whatever the boys were talking about must have been so boring that i spaced out.
it's no use, seele. she's made up her mind. i could tell from her expression.
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea. anyway, i'm getting off-track, i won't take any more of your time. good luck.
vihar, thank you so much for doing all of this, and even dressed up as the knight of flowers, no less.
even if you don't believe my outsider friends, you should believe me ugh, maybe i've wasted your trust in which case, believe bronya.
zhiyi was born into a poor family. paying people to get his stories out there is within the rules of the game, as far as i'm concerned.
hey, fancy seeing you here.
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
hee-hee, stop it hanshirou, you'll embarrass me!
hmm the geomarrow fuel activation component probably stopped working. do you have a spare one?
my real name is guinevere, but a xianzhou friend came up with an authentic xianzhou name based on the pronunciation.
uhhh, no thanks. this is actually sounding pretty weird.
no matter how long it takes, i am committed to bringing this to fruition. this is my promise.
my, someone rather discerning fitted out this shrine.
that's certainly what the clan genealogies claim, although my personal knowledge of qimen divination is very patchy.
that's it~! first you arrive out of the blue, then the general recruits you to the cause -- it's like the stories where imperial heroes bring salvation to the world.
do you still remember when we first arrived in penacony? who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. i should be thanking him.
you know as well as i do that she's always been like this. why start fretting about it now?
i don't think we're going to get anywhere asking questions like that. let's just take a look around.
i didn't do much, just helped you leave the memory zone.
now that we're done with our tour of the skysplitter, shall we continue with our training?
how about forgoing the mask design then? a mask with no facial features, a personality with no personality
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
the main consideration for you is how to make the best use of the available space
all the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. i stand before it alone and unchanging.
besides, if you were really so determined to end it all, you wouldn't have given us the opportunity to share our opinions. you think you're oh-so cold and ruthless, but i'm not buying it.
though i've never gone diving together with anyone before, i must say that i certainly look forward to it.
ugh in the eyes of most people, there's a world of difference between "trivial matters" and a career.
anyway, i'll take this core back and examine it. now, let's insert pascal's core into the big fella's shell.
the people of belobog hold both of you in high regard. they'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
well, it appears that you are still unable to give explanations for several details about how the nameless got involved in the ambrosial arbor crisis.
hehe. i had to. i wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
alright, you'll be safe here. my workshop has pretty good soundproofing, and barely anyone comes in.
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
but general, the situation inside is still chaotic and perilous. your presence would be
we're cheap labor. like livestock, but easier to control nothing more.
look how smashed up this ceiling tile is... arlan must have bottled up his frustration and had no way of releasing it -- so he took it out on the monsters!
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
thanks for your hard work. is there any news from trianne?
speaking of which, how are things with the whistling flames?
no problem. just think of it as my greeting gift for little klee.
the looks on your faces tell me you found some good stories.
let me see yeah, we can make do with this part. this little machine isn't half bad.
with all this in mind, firefly and her companion -- there should only be one -- have entered this corridor together.
hehe regardless, please do look after me while i'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
i'm just speaking my mind. trust me, you're really talented.
and you're here now, so even if you're gonna leave eventually, i wanna make sure you at least leave with fond memories.
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
it's alright, monsieur neuvillette. given their confidence, i expect they've found the crucial evidence.
yes. i don't know whether it was the sages or lesser lord kusanali who came up with the idea.
look, miss sparkle has given us a puzzle where every single answer is correct.
you hear a few strange noises. suddenly, all the torches in the ruin go out at once.
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
say no more. there's no doubt, it's a demonic curse alright aeur" and a serious one at that.
you mean how it looks? like a train. well
well all i did was say my wishes for her out loud. maybe the magic is in the words, themselves, just like the book said!
so, what do you think your odds are, march?
ah, i'm fine, don't worry about me. let's discuss the matter at hand.
finished, huh? what did you think?
are you really from the divination commission?
in all likelihood, he's just an opportunistic merchant. nothing quite as scandalous as matsuda and uchimura had imagined.
because you used dirty tricks to trample all over the honest work of others!
i'll, uh i'll go keep watch!
that concludes our discussion. we will inform all participants of the result when a decision has been made. thank you all for coming.
uh well, let's leave that for now and head back to wangsheng funeral parlor. this big g matter is very closely linked to meng.
luocha already saw the control panel -- why is it taking this long to find it
you two have held out long enough -- help is at hand!
yes, i suggested to yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. a hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."
yeah, she isn't the same as before, but
warriors of the past who spilled your blood on this land, your noble souls now rest in this earth.
you shouldn't ignore them, by the way. very often, they're an omen of something terminal.
i'm going to write out the schedule. i promise i won't make you collapse under the pressure!
for the sake of the vision hunt decree, of course. don't you think the shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
so, thank you. truly.
we're not entirely sure he said something about "adding an element of mystery to the story."
let's leave that aside for now, then. on to the military question: watatsumi island's forces will need to come back under the jurisdiction of the tenryou commission.
use that will of yours to reach the end of your story. that's the you i like.
no one is in any doubt as to the iudex's authority. he always delivers a fair verdict aeur" and when necessary, i will reiterate the fairness of this verdict with my sword.
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
don't make excuses for her.
we didn't find anything directly related to the museum thefts, but there was one thing worth noting
exactly. they traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. doesn't she sound very much like that clockie you saw?
i can't let myself see only the things i want to see. how would that make me any different from before?
uh you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence
come on, let's take the microfilm back to the museum.
you recall all the lessons you've learned in your time and begin to carefully observe the woman's mannerisms.
wait, there shouldn't be a "two" in binary arithmetic!
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around
i'm sorry you didn't get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around i promise i'll make it up to you all next time.
that pink-haired fox tried to say something. i'm pretty sure he sensed something fishy. since he's not familiar with this place, he just dropped us a hint, but you didn't seem to be paying attention at all.
although you attempted to make a promise, your resolve didn't match your response a step will be recorded.
that shouldn't be necessary... but if it makes the nameless feel less defensive, i'll be happy to abide.
now that you know ororon was only trying to protect another member of his tribe, could i ask you to petition the pyro archon for her forgiveness?
fortunately, while the path of the order governs all things, it can't affect the nihility. i came to realize this when the dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
hehe, no need. while what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
mister callas' last wish was for me to ensure your safety, and i will not betray his trust. he would do the same, were he alive today.
i trust you guys. but regarding what happened in the theme park, what do you hounds think about it? it's okay. feel free to speak your mind.
our situation is grim. there doesn't appear to be a way out for now. we should be prepared to stay for a while.
why isn't svarog helping you?
oh? she heads up the force? hm not bad.
is this what it means to reminisce?
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
cyno and layla both have four points, putting them both in first place. the rest in descending order are tighnari, faruzan, kaveh, and hat guy.
what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
but for some reason, there's a hollowed-out space beneath the tavern where i couldn't sense anything at all
hmm, a most opportune outcome.
i apologize for my tardiness, once again.
it's when it stops beating that we need to worry. just take in the atmosphere and prepare yourself.
you will learn the truth about this world from me, and in return, i ask for you to promise me something.
let's leave it there for today then. i'm sure we'll find out what else mister narrator has planned for us tomorrow.
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
this weapon may be young, but he's already very mature. he likes to keep up with the all the latest news.
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me
huh? what's it got to do with anything organic? i thought mechanical parts were fine in the tournament.
since there is such a great deal of difference between the story and the reality, i don't feel offended at all. on the contrary, i find the author's powers of imagination quite admirable.
no wonder wildfire and the silvermane guards were never able to find gears and wisdom
and there you have it, that's the truth behind what happened
i must be prepared for anything. if there are more formidable monsters lying in wait in this area, i must make sure i have the strength to face them.
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
hehe, it strikes me that you'd use any means to achieve your goal, benefactor.
thanks to them, we can finally start recruiting troops on the scale we need to openly confront the shogun's army on the front line.
aaru village is not a big place. outsiders stand out here like a sore thumb. i'd bet word about you has already gotten out.
wow, that's pretty great! i wish the photographers at my shows had your skills!
good example. do you know how to do the drunken swordplay?
come on, i don't need that kind of attention. xavier can accept the reward on our behalf.
well, you're just as good at comforting people as mister moze.
my second question has to do with the ensuing duel. if the truth is indeed as you described
the past few days have been some of the most challenging work i've ever taken on.
and i, in turn, will tell you how i really think.
alright, take him to get some rest. he's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
huh, this space is completely empty
it would appear so. this area of the sea is independent and does not border any country, so it certainly seems out of place here.
sure you don't want my help? c'mon, it's a great deal: cook twice the amount in the same time!
sounds like a very hungry criminal came up with a very poor excuse
all kinds of spectacular scenes appeared in front of the first sage, as if all the knowledge in the world was being painted onto a canvas right before him. he was captivated.
you mentioned appropriate compensation. perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
oh, by the way, which way did the doctor go when he left pardis dhyai?
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
there's no style in resorting to violence. it's simply the worst of all the bad decisions you could make.
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
i can see why you'd suggest that. you're thinking i could use my knowledge of how mora works to my advantage and make a lot of money there.
but only someone from the six commissions could bring the stellaron into the xianzhou undetected, let alone plant it within the ambrosial arbor
that won't be necessary. i remember it all.
if you could find anything that aurelie left behind perhaps we can get a better sense of what she went through in her final days.
this is an automated area, so don't you think that there are a bit too many people here today?
people often say that a kamera's photo can never replace an artist's painting because the former has no spirit to it.
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
but then i saw these two random guys in the middle of a pointless argument. it ticked me off, and things went downhill from there
together, they did something bad -- something terrible. it led to horrific consequences.
okay, story time. so, whenever kouichi brings one of his friends from the trade association to see me, they always mention how they used to play with me when i was a kid, or held me once as a baby, or something.
please accept our humble gifts, i hope you'll find them to your liking.
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct
miss march, you might have the wrong idea. i'm just feeling a mix of regret and relief.
*sigh* i'm tired of packing. let's leave it here for today. thanks for your help.
everyone seemed supportive, too. seems like bronya made a pretty good impression on them.
oh, i can completely understand that. then let me ask you this do you remember roughly when the grownups started talking about zhiyi?
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
that's what mister svarog said. he said pascal's emotional intelligence was like a virus that infected the entire base network at some point.
"the express has lots of express friends, and it wants to find them and play together."
i had to scare them a little, though. otherwise i hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
we'll go over there and see what we can find out. don't worry, i don't think she's gone too far.
lady bailu disappeared? that's nothing new -- she sneaks off all the time.
come on, i've told you my story aeur" now it's your turn. shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
you mean, the creation magic his grandfather saw outside the hut of blessings? hmm, i wonder how exactly did the goddess of creation give them life?
why even bother to ask? if you were truly convinced of my intent to harm them, you would have intervened.
topaz shared with me the story of the stellaron's descent upon jarilo-vi -- how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
if others were to find out i agreed to work with you so easily, then, well
you're leaving? actually, i suddenly have a craving for some good food let's go, i'll treat you. don't worry, i have some pocket money from grandpa.
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
yes, i should take the opportunity to show you around while you're here.
anyway, you should watch and learn, because i plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that divine priestess from watatsumi island.
take this one for example: "the good thing about being reincarnated as a hilichurl is that i only need to eat sunsettias to become stronger"
the profoundest of the profound is the musou no hitotachi. a sword art without parallel in all the world. with you as my sparring partner, i can perfect that technique even further.
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
hmm, there seems to be quite a market for this ahem, never mind. let's get ready, and start the game.
i stared out at the sea for goodness knows how long i just couldn't let it go i just couldn't.
it was almost like a performance. we took the stage and put on our best show.
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
to put it simply, we were afraid that our shows would lose their meaning if people couldn't understand them
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals at least, it was at the time of recording.
no need to thank me, just a cloud knight doing her job!
really? and how do i know you're not leading us straight into a trap? don't forget, you're the one with no bargaining chips.
there's a rich scent of curiosity here such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
mister, can i please have a look at the weapon you're holding on to?
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur
just some colleagues. think of this as a business competition or a personal grudge
you've got to have a proper breakfast to get yourself in the right mood for work.
fear not, mirror. you have to remember that being a genius means you're destined to solve challenge after challenge. there's no time for rest.
do you see what i mean now? their attitude was just as i expected.
to be honest, i was only able to put it all together because of some background knowledge about this area.
do we have any other choice? i am starting to feel a little worn out, though
i said relax, there's no need to go treading on eggshells. do you really think the eternity i pursue is something that can be shaken by dango and milk?
the taste is fairly standard, but i can see you worked hard at it.
actually, we are still investigating. it's just that we've discovered something strange.
of course, everyone has heard of the vanquishing general, known to all, and unbeknown to none.
ode to fool this must be the second act.
favor? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
really? well then, uh, sure maeur"madam faruzan. maybe you could pick out a few fashionable outfits for us.
could you please prepare a serving of my uncle's favorite, gebratenes fleisch mit sauerkraut? we'll take it as a gift to him later.
i usually get woken up by random loud noises, so it was a surprise to wake up naturally this morning. to be honest, it's quite an unfamiliar experience.
another implies that you were already served some delicious cake while you were up there. hmm, how lovely.
i felt very sheepish, having had a change of heart after flatly refusing you. and then, to make matters worse, you caught me
(*sigh* true he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
hehe, is that so? how interesting. let's hear your reasoning, then.
perfect! i chose it carefully -- it's perfect for beautiful young swordswomen like you and me!
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath
i wasn't scared by anything but on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
speaking of which, most of the guards who report directly to the six sages belong to the corps of thirty, but they have a completely different reputation.
publicly insulting the supreme guardian only elevates the seriousness of your crimes. throw down your arms and surrender!
hmph that's because you're not from my tribe. you don't know how many delusions of grandeur i've destroyed just by existing!
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
if silver needs to be polished to shine, it only makes sense that we need to keep honing our skills to become as light and swift as a swallow.
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
but the president wants what's best for aurum alley too, and yet we still disagree with him.
i'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale do share it with me, won't you? i couldn't bear to miss out.
nothing escapes your attention, miss navigator.
sometimes, you need an excuse to do things you otherwise couldn't, and a harbinger is more valuable than you might imagine.
shouldn't it be the audience who decides if a show is intellectual or enlightening? why is someone from the akademiya judging that?
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market
i've checked the lines, there don't seem to be any major problems. all that's left is the energy hub.
if you like, i can give all of you a small private show any time.
you don't talk like a cook, you sound more like a tv host or something.
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back or maybe i'm just describing myself.
hmm? was there something else you wanted to talk about?
"one of the healers from the alchemy commission had lady bailu cornered, but then she disappeared into thin air"
a letter that guides us to activate mechanisms on a deserted archipelago it's bizarre.
what if huohuo came across a lead today -- something that sounded like tail's doing? knowing her, she's probably gone looking for him
i i was just ever so slightly concerned about the situation you mentioned. yes. a teensy bit concerned, that's all.
hmm, that's true. anyway, since he asked for help, it's time to give those monsters a shock!
if my memory serves me right, the parts this little fella stole were originally designed for that kind of pet upgrade.
and what do you mean by "take away"? is he planning to leave sumeru?
and who is this softly spoken little lady?
(i lied aeur" hearing each other's thoughts actually depends on the strength of the connection between our memories.)
the intelligentsia guild is always able to find a way to support their case, writing enough "scholarship" in one night to fill a library this is a problem.
lessig, both you and i never had anything to do with the glory of the lawrence clan. that is all in the past, we are just ordinary people.
alright, alright. lady bailu, it's getting late -- you need to go home now.
it was only much later when i realized that the shows were more for him than they ever were for me.
that was a fine duel indeed. if you wouldn't mind, shall we play a few more matches?
mm. but what you haven't heard is that it's currently very close to you -- a couple of warp jumps away, in fact.
watch your words, no need to be aggressive here
additionally, the shogun has no need of recreation. there would be no need for her to come here just to pass the time or to relax.
grandpa always asks me to go look at swords with him, but he hasn't said anything about this one. it's really weird.
let's go. we shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
no, i never issued such an order.
the luofu has enjoyed centuries of stability since the end of the sedition of imbibitor lunae, much of which can be attributed to general jing yuan's masterful strategizing.
or to put it another way, they were all people who have had a taste of something that was mine and convinced themselves that i am someone to be taken advantage of.
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
miss sigewinne was with you, and the duke has business of his own.
in the end, oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the underworld.
never mind. i'll be honest with you then, i desire to spar with you.
she's a flower-growing drummer and a great report writer. name a more reliable girl. i'll wait.
the encounter at the dreamscape hotel was a sign.
i'm sushang, and i recently joined the cloud knights. talk to me if you have any issues but i don't know the luofu very well either, hehe.
welcome back. i trust beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
what's up? i'll only answer questions about the simulated universe.
are you all there? here, like last time, repeat after meaeur"
pengyi, please redraft our plans, make a summary report, and send it to the ministry of civil affairs.
a guild that doesn't proactively help businesses has no reason to exist.
those travelers who came seeking hanguang's swords all came in the name of justice and honor.
no, i've thought about it. she deserves a day off.
anyway, sorry for my reaction back there i got a bit too excited when i saw you two
it's kinda hard to believe what you just told me first, let me make something clear: most of us desert-dwellers might not be the scholarly type, but we do have basic common sense
"the xianzhou luofu cordially invites jarilo-vi's warriors to join the wardance."
be at ease, you two. make yourselves at home if you wish.
would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at yae publishing house instead?
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
memokeeper do you think you can just leave?
i really can't recommend that store highly enough. a couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
okay! i'll go ask for you right now.
i'm afraid so. there are still other people who need my help. i won't go far, though, and i'll come back to visit the minute i have time to spare.
i have been gathering the funds necessary to build it from the time i began learning the merchant's craft. and since becoming the tianquan, i have spared no effort in hiring the best craftsmen to constantly extend it
then, i'm sure you know there are those who question whether it actually occurred.
what she really wanted to say was this: "how soon do you think you could open a branch in the plane of euthymia?"
come now, did you really think we wouldn't notice you sneaking around?
though it is heartbreaking to lose a kindred spirit, life goes on because there are new friends waiting for you further down the road.
looks like our hunch was on the mora. these newcomers are very suspicious.
thank you for your help, mister moze. we'll do our best to ensure your friend's safety.
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general
...so, come with me. i'll take you home.
i haven't seen you smiling much recently. if you ask me, someone like you must look lovely when they smile.
not only does she not fit your description, but she voluntarily gave up her gnosis long ago, severing her ties with celestia in the process.
it's been a long time since i last came to this village. there's been a lot to deal with recently
it's still early, so why don't we get some tea at the alchemy commission? we can discuss your suggestions for revitalizing the commission.
i noticed you quietly completed that backlog of paperwork we had you deserve the chance to unwind a little.
we meet again, distinguished guests.
that's why i'm here, but i wouldn't call that my wish. i don't think that alone will call the stars down for us, right?
and as for hoolay, i'll send my lieutenants jiaoqiu and moze to check on his condition in prison and ready him for transport. if there are no more questions, shall we get this started?
so how about it? will you join me?
but with your level of ability, i'm sure it was a walk in the park.
but with such a large group, it's inevitable that troublemakers will find their way in. they've been stealing from the miners and picking fights. and that's not the worst of it.
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later
oh, by the way, you're overthinking the whole natlan issue, paimon. natlan has human inhabitants and its own unique culture, just like fontaine.
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly
ooh, i would love naeur"no, no need. that would be needlessly indulgent.
now now, this is a grown-up situation, okay? it's not fun and games anymore. and don't try and follow me.
sounds like an unusual condition you've got there. you should stay a while in penacony!
it must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
tch the showmanship's not bad, i'll give her that.
the paper looks familiar can i open it?
an environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
that cursed sword has messed with your ability to think, but i'll break you free from its grip! i'll shatter its illusion and the sword itself!
i can't say for sure, but they're definitely planning something for the charmony festival.
work? as long as lisa's there, i'm not worried. she's more hardworking than anyone once she gets going.
he has his own goals and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
that being said, why did you decide to come back into this mess? dealing with heliobi isn't an easy task
um, no need. i'll handle the clinic. i assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
pengyi, is everything clear? please remember the tasks i've given you.
because that statement holds true for me as well. this is where the script ends.
i will practice more and seize victory next time.
yes. leave, before i let my judgment get the better of me.
on behalf of the ten-lords commission, i commend you for your great service in resolving the divination commission crisis. i will honor all of you before the ten lords.
even if we'd done nothing at all, shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
no, i recognize my family's handwriting. we are all doctors after all.
besides, you guys need someone familiar with the divination commission to show you the way, right? then let's go.
nice to meet you, i'm natasha -- an underworld doctor. feeling sick? take a seat, let me take a look.
so, "dear friend" don't die on me out here.
i won't force you, but people hope to regard one another with bare honesty when they enter a bath. are you willing to trust me?
it's just i'm not good at this. i'm not used to being close to people.
i don't doubt it, cyno, but this is about more than me and them there's a lot more where they came from.
way over there, see that house on the hill? that's natasha's old orphanage.
poisson was just involved in a disaster, so it's presently devoid of people. that naturally makes it the best choice.
so i won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. what matters is that i tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
show off your flashy moves and make the audience cheer for you!
aha, i see. herta's collections aren't in the system, so anything unaffected should be our target.
they've been up for a while already. the young guy with the dark hair left first -- he went with sampo.
it's fine. those of us here are all trustworthy, so there isn't any harm in it.
"ride the wind and go off on a big adventure." klee, your mom sounds like a very cool person.
let's disembark here, benefactors.
you'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
how can that be? my ship was the last one into port before the jade gate was shut. the sky-faring commission has already locked down starskiff haven entirely
during the war, there were highs and there were lows, and in the end there was a glorious victory. for you, perhaps the experience was one of great excitement.
very well, it was indeed just as you said.
considering even their visions have been taken from them and embedded in the statue, they are ultimately quite helpless.
just as you start to make way to the square, intent on finding the man again, there's a voice
cirrus may not know the location of tail, but they still figured out a way to divert everyone's attention.
but last time we met, he mentioned he had something to do in aaru village. you can try your luck there.
in the meantime, i expect the takatsukasa clan to continue supporting the kujou clan as before.
the souls of the sacrificed are still wandering this hall i hear their endless bemoaning, their senseless deaths have left them wronged, their mournful wails echo endlessly.
according to the lord of the night, the ruler of death is one of the shining shades, an extremely elusive figure. even woven scrolls dating back thousands of years have nearly no mentions of her.
even a child's toy isn't safe from your grasp is greed one of your vices?
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
huh. i wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
i didn't get a wink of sleep last night.
even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. amazing
you see broken iron swords scattered all around you and downed trees riddled with terrifying claw marks.
with a more powerful shogun, i will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
i've thought about it this responsibility rests on bronya's shoulders, not mine.
we'll also need to make some immediate adjustments to the lighting, props, and costumes.
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
seriously, though, i think the topics i mentioned are the ones really worth sharing with you.
kaeya, i've approved your vacation request, use this time to relax and unwind. don't worry about the report and other work, i'll take care of it.
unbelievable, right? the food is so good.
we can't give up. right now, our number one priority has to be getting out of here alive.
if he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. he'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what i mean.
need someone to talk to, hmm? aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
i tend to forget things -- which is why, rather than memories, i'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what i normally wouldn't otherwise. so...
please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. in ancient times, poetry was all the rage. but nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
you're right. it seems she really hasn't considered anything.
the light here why is it still on? this place has clearly been abandoned for a long time
my patience is running out. you should know when a mercenary is after something other than money.
to get us started, i've proposed a crossover between the merchant guild and spices supreme -- buy a meal box and get a visiograph of bailu!
plus, you don't have to keep an eye out for monsters popping out of the ground or vultures swooping down from the sky.
it really does have a tracking function let's see how useful it is.
now that i think about it, that whole speech about magicians making things disappear was nothing more than a provocation, a bald-faced challenge!
i'm the least accomplished in swordplay, but i came out unscathed. i really ought to thank my masters for taking all the blows on my behalf.
belobog's future is not for sale, and we'll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need -- not once, but twice.
he regards you with suspicion for quite some time, before shaking his head. perhaps he's finally accepted that you're here to help.
easier said than done do you know how?
i wonder who the next person to find a disruptor will be
smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. that is how yae miko wages war!
you can forget about escaping.
the cocolia i knew would sit on the roof and listen to my songs, but not the supreme guardian.
you've been on the xianzhou for this long and you've never heard of the ten-lords commission?
wow, this market is even busier than the one in port ormos.
huh? you're leaving so soon?
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
i, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. approved.
but if you're going to work in the space station long-term, the stellaron may have some serious effects on the station's fragmentum. as the lead researcher, that's a risk i cannot take.
thanks for your help. the elemental flow is finally stable.
yes. he told us that we have to shut down the theater within thirty days, and that it's going to be demolished
do you remember the invite that the express received?
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
interesting. before i decide, i'd like to know what gave you this idea?
the qualities you've mentioned are very likely the reasons mydeimos refused this coreflame.
all these years, and the view at the alchemy commission hasn't changed a bit.
wait, aren't we supposed to be operating in secret?
when i was still one of the architects working in the scientific research division, i was researching the stellaron.
her son, sohrin, has already passed his theater exam, and he'll soon be our newest member.
hey, enough pessimism! back in my "official capacity" days, i spent a lot of time in the north -- i got to know the soldiers and officers on the front line very well.
i'll roll the dice, and the score decides who confesses.
a duel? i had the same intention in mind. let us begin at once.
oh? you recognized me right away. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
let me tell you something. there were two mutes, but one is dead now, and the other though he's still in penacony, i'm afraid you'll never find him again.
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
descendant of the kujou clan. regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the kujou name.
so, even if it seems small to you -- you did a very great thing here.
i know, i understand. but please, let the ten-lords commission deal with this. we'll find a way to extract this heliobus from huohuo.
we're all here but where's the president?
indeed it seems that you understood what i meant to say from the very beginning.
it was one of the oldest and most precious items in the general hall collection -- the meteor fragment.
don't try and get me to cook. i can take care of anything else, but not that.
i happen to have some time at the moment and came to take a look. i sometimes have my clothes custom-made at this boutique, in any case, so we always have a lot to talk about.
he will be fine. cloud knights, search for the target!
master diviner, do i have to come
gradually, it developed into a lucrative business.
everyone, this is captain dunn, an old friend of mine. he used to be an ace on the keys in the band.
first we need to find out who's supporting him don't worry, i've got a plan.
hehe, there's no one else here, pela -- no need for such formality.
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool and it seems like a stunt they'd pull
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
huh? wait, so that round bird is named tubby?
none of the things he's doing right now make any sense if he's just trying to keep me from getting tangled up in his world
so you've made it your daily mission to tease me, huh?
restricted area? since when were you in charge of fyxestroll garden?
best not to ponder, you'll be scratching your chin all day.
huh it's just, there are less painkillers than i'd expected. did someone break into the storage room?
and because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
yep, i guess you can put it that way. it takes strong convictions to be as dedicated as she is and shoulder that kind of responsibility.
but mister svarog doesn't like talking to others, especially wildfire
this guitar was one of those inventions. cocolia came up with a name
did they scare you? these two are wenyuan and shanghua. they work for me.
no, it's not a code. the words are meaningless.
such is the story of the marechaussee hunters. they pursue the phantoms in the darkness and exterminate all who pose a threat
haha, you make it sound so abominable. i'm just trying to get them to see the humor in it all.
unfortunately, my cousin could not give me a definitive answer on this, despite scouring the family library.
greetings, miss robin. i didn't expect to meet you here.
in fact, i chose this job from the very start because i knew it'd be right up my alley.
this trolley can raise and lower, and even rotate, ensuring that the box will face in the right direction.
(he's sure saying some weird stuff.)
mm i haven't kept track in a while. since i started training at flamewheel forge, the number should be three hundred and twelve.
ha, i was protecting you more like -- it's a cloud knight's job to protect others. this area is under martial law, i'm escorting all civilians to safety. follow me.
klee, where did you hide the treasure to begin with?
every wig brings out a different style. it feels like a new challenge every time i try a different do!
your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. something that shines in unison with fate itself.
if he was just looking to celebrate by himself, he wouldn't spend his meager savings on an expensive bottle of alcohol, let alone buy a pair of special wine glasses.
i didn't lie to you, right? i told you i'd bring you somewhere safe, and i did! though we did take a bit of a detour
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past
it seems as if i've become a pawn in someone else's game.
although faith is more important to the vast majority, there are still quite a number of citizens who care more about their worldly possessions.
it will be a lot of work, and i'm most grateful to you.
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
having a dojo in one's home is akin to placing one's sword on the table. it is a reminder to never be negligent.
people of the underworld, i dare not ask for your forgiveness -- i now know the reality of your decade of suffering
so, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
hello, students. i'm very happy to be hosting the dreamlight anniversary this year.
but don't worry, now that his spirit's returned, there just one step left. let's meet up again in two days.
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
the general said there are traitors aboard the ship.
the university plans to hold an academic conference on the topic of "trailblazing" in the moment of sol. the astral express has been invited as guests to the conference.
but, when we were preparing for the debate, i heard something quite wise. maybe it'll help you.
every child in belobog should visit this exhibit at least once no, once isn't nearly enough.
hehe, why don't you tell me a little more about how you got here first? then i'll
hold on. my lady, does this friend happen to be nilou? the one who sends flowers to the estate?
no matter how pressing the situation may become, i must remain composed. if i let the stress get to me, then what can i expect from others around me?
i thought lisa's pouch was to be used for an emergency. i didn't expect it to contain a set of summer clothing.
i suggest we move to the shrine to discuss our counter-plan. what say you?
i've been to their estate many times, and i've never noticed anything suspicious.
you said that when the hydro archon first created fontainians out of oceanids, she filled their blood vessels with primordial seawater
it seems someone from beyond the wall must have been supporting this.
that oleg he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
according to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain path or aeon's power.
oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
to the xianzhou, i am but an abandoned pawn -- a wandering swordmaster. if you wish to avoid trouble, pretend we never met.
my time with you has been a great help to the luofu, and a great help to me. i want to say thank you, both publicly and privately.
but you also look like you're up to no good haha, seems pretty interesting.
but given the urgency of the situation, let's just ignore the usual regulations.
er have you ever heard of the marechaussee hunters?
your present will is not the product of erosion. i shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
i want to give you something more practical and realistic, something that can really help you. so, it may be different from how you imagined
looks like you're facing a difficult choice once again.
according to the plan, we should first go to pardis dhyai, and ask for forest watcher tighnari.
i had no idea you'd been holding onto it all this time haha, i guess it was meant to be. you're more than welcome to keep it if you like.
master masakatsu aeur" how do you feel? can you hold on?
yeah, it's a favorite in her tribe. i bet she still hasn't realized the feast is already over
i'm not gonna let you off the hook that easy -- there's more to this story. you need to explain what the heck got into you today.
hmm i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
why did you not tell your companions about my true identity?
its change in size and power really is suspicious.
correct. although it possessed shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. as a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train shingo to become bolder.
but there is some information i can give you. that place is also used to welcome non-humanoid visitors and has a shuttle that connects to outer space.
most of those so-called "great heroes" were heartless killers. they are only called heroes because they won.
to reach scrivener hall, we must take this elevator and go through the frozen prison.
haha, you've no need to worry.
let's go. the venue for this meeting is in the kanjou commission headquarters up there. the view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
yeah but since she brushed it aside when the tianquan asked her about it, i don't see how i can broach the topic. i've only known her for a few days
why is that surprising? playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and i was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
oh thanks, but no thanks. i can't stand moving at someone else's pace.
it's alright, huixin. you can stay in liyue harbor and finish your work. leave the rest to us.
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
constantly communicating with people, trying to retain their morale, having to read between the lines, making sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve it's such hard work.
you're afraid afraid to accept that the fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
because as far as most people are concerned, mora is the key to any and all opportunities.
not necessarily. if you ask me
seriously, do you actually know anything about swordplay or what?
the prophecy sent an ambassador. they acknowledged lord phainon's strength and character, but had doubts about his strength of will.
oh? more approachable and appeasable than you'd imagined?
i did. it was a gift from sigewinne. want to give it a try? i think the color would suit you, too.
i once saw one of our prop people make something similar. it looked really cool, so i took some time during my break to learn the basics. it's not a bad way to stave off sleepiness, either!
ah, such an intense emotion heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
hah? hold up, he's back? that can't be, he was still in the city a little while ago
my apologies.
hmm? have you finished exploring the festival?
or we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
come on. enough procrastinating. let's go.
actually, we're not really unauthorized, are we, judge?
i was completely moved by what she had said, so i started taking dance lessons from her. and later on, i began to dance here in her stead.
fine by me. then i'll take my time. but you'll be begging to tell me everything by the time i'm through.
rest assured, we will come to skott's aid if needed. let's hope he's alright.
why would someone from such a wealthy family do something like this for money it's unbelievable! we have to find a way to stop this before they sell the film!
oh, really? so that's how you see me?
ultimately, he knocked cowell out, and the tool meant to cover the crime up also became a murder weapon.
if kafka was holding an umbrella, that means she was in an area with artificial rainfall during the transmission.
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
to be honest, i've been studying methods of discourse lately in hopes of altering my stern appearance.
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
watatsumi island observes different customs than the rest of inazuma. i imagine it must all seem a little alien to you?
if you're bored, you could go and find the messenger from the divination commission.
you let that status of yours go to your head, huh? afraid to show weakness? that's why you're keeping so much bottled up inside, right?
seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
outlanders, if the current situation changed dramatically, could you eventually point your blades at okhema and its citizens?
it doesn't bother me. i just hope she didn't make you feel too awkward
not many from outside liyue earn the right to ascend to the jade chamber. but i have been in correspondence with the acting grand master of the knights of favonius, who spoke highly of you.
this inazuman machine could well be something that dodo-king left here for us to find and activate.
i just couldn't believe that he never lifted a finger to oppose cocolia's order to seal the passageway
that's a shipwright's soldering gun, i think one of the workers here must have left it behind.
i wanted to express my gratitude for the helpful advice you provided before the match.
so we had to map out the gates all over again to make sure we're deploying the array properly.
the child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some fried tofu.
especially that little bird named tubby. looks like she has her own teapot, what's up with that?
common sense says my wallet should've emptied itself a long time ago. there's no way i wouldn't have noticed that.
either way, if this part of the story is true, then the rescuer has to have been an adeptus.
yes, i think i might ask souka to ditch her original characters and just make you the protagonists in her next novel.
jiaoqiu always said i'm the most impatient person among the cloud knights, and i can't argue with that. so there's no reason for you to be more anxious than me.
shortly after it was found, the stone was lost in transit, and it hasn't been seen since. this stone here has all the same features, so i suspect it could be the one that went missing all those years ago.
look at these ashes. someone was burning documents not long before we arrived.
delicious. i've already memorized the recipe.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape.
both of you are new here, so it's only natural to be confused about the prophecy, titans, and chrysos heirs that have been mentioned in passing. but i'd like you to learn about amphoreus's history before i tell you more.
so i guess now, the kids' impression of the great mujina youkai is mostly influenced by me.
i have a bad feeling about this luka always does things on the spur of the moment.
i guess that's what it means literally.
hiding the exuvia was a necessary maneuver to take the initiative back, to play the spider while our foes scurry about.
in other words, you still have some reservations towards me.
i remember i used to always stay home all by myself when i was little. i didn't really have any friends in fact, i seldom spoke to anyone.
looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence
hello, we're from the society for fish price research. we'd just like to ask a few questions.
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
even today, in my hometown people still say things like, "you'll never cross mt. tao du when you die." it's very insulting though, so don't go around repeating it
so, have you thought things through?
the almighty shogun? it would be improper of me to comment, given that i am one of her subjects. all i will say is that i think that her excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.
you guessed it! everyone agrees that there is no better candidate than you.
my grandfather told me that, back when he was a boy, children learned the art of kite-making step by step from their elders.
what i'd like to know is pom-pom a rabbit that learned to speak? or a person that was turned into a rabbit?
no need to stay here if you have a pressing matter. we all know you can't leave palais mermonia for long.
use of force here is strictly forbidden. before you proceed, which of you would like to face criminal charges for dishonoring the shogun, hmm?
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
let's go, we must try to squeeze some answers out of cirrus.
some of these souls never made it to the ley lines, others escaped from the night kingdom, and even more don't even come from natlan complicated doesn't even begin to describe it.
leaving it up to fate? it's just how that gambler thinks.
to validate his theories. no wonder his manifesto contains so many insights aeur" it's all the result of his firsthand experimentation.
that's right, you've been all the talk at the tavern. "that little girl from sumeru is really good at the game if i can find the chance, i would love to test my skills against her."
yikes good thing i didn't wear it for long when i was working in sumeru city. at first, i thought it was a good thing, too.
hmm, interesting so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control f--from the bridge, i mean.
mingxi, please share with us what the guild has in mind.
although he's trying his best to conceal his current state, his uneven gait and the sweat dripping down his forehead make it obvious that he's been wounded and is in serious pain.
the weather is dreadful, the fog is thick, and visibility is low. just like lisa said.
oh, has night fallen already? then you'd best go have a rest.
that's all you needed to say! let's go.
little gui's methods can be a little unorthodox, but that's just because she has a vivid imagination when it comes to getting things done, she's actually pretty reliable.
hook, julian, and the moles all have different dreams. i don't think anyone should take them away
since neither of us is eager to engage in combat, let us respectfully part ways.
yes, i feel a lot better. the more i think back on everything, the more surreal it all feels.
"the nature of this memory is special. don't ruin the dreamscape experience for anyone else by spoiling the ending."
the lighting on the express is perfect for observations. great views at the windows too.
you will miss much by refusing progress you seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
i simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. she's more fragile than i'd imagined.
thank you all very much. i promise you that i will create a bright future for inazuma.
looks like the key to winning lies not in the puzzle itself, but in the motives behind miss sparkle's strange behavior i'm afraid this chase may just go on forever.
guuji yae, your allegation is not only dangerous but ridiculous. the tri-commission has served the shogun since ancient times and remains absolutely loyal to this day.
he chose that specific liquor from xinyue kiosk because the fiery flavor would mask the bitterness of the poison, and he chose to wait until the fatui official was drunk and had his guard down before delivering it to him.
hehe, i was kidding. was that surprising? i can crack jokes every now and then, too. i just rarely see the need.
(a pawnshop that grants wishes is there really a place like that on this ship?)
so mister boothill, i'm familiar with the galaxy rangers and their exploits, as well as with the entities they pursue.
well, why make "omni" money when you can make ordinary money first~?
it also wasn't spinning at the right speed. before the incident, it spun much faster than that.
i forgot to introduce myself. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
oh, it just occurred to me that we should also get you a makeup box.
the budget is exactly what it's meant to be. it's the necessary amount of funds to properly carry out a task.
ah, there you are. let me introduce the team:
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
it's alright, relax. i'm just here to look around. i'm having a change of pace today.
that's okay. my intention here was to show you some of the repercussions of that great battle.
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i am invited to host the public bidding of the aurum alley commercial district. with members of all parties present, the proceedings may begin.
so, it seems that some borisin have returned to stargazer navalia in disguise. the answer seems quite obvious
i prefer how things are now. i can come and go as i please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
well, once a seed is planted, no matter how long it takes, it'll eventually sprout and bear fruit.
are you all right? watch out for sandstorms.
my period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. i will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
remember when we entered the hotel in the dreamscape for the first time, and i procured a few trinkets from your companions? their functions are similar.
even so, let me buy them at market value.
human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
mm. i understand now.
an eyewitness claimed to have seen ororon speaking to some fatui soldiers here.
i can't remember the last time i went for a walk like this. i never thought i'd take one through such a strange place, with someone i'd only just gotten to know.
the general mahamatra always comes and goes without a trace. normally, no one knows his whereabouts.
in adventuring, as in business, you always have to seize the opportunity while it's there.
we can stop here. i think i know where the doctor went.
so where are we headed to now, bronya?
have you made up your mind, firefly?
the tenryou commission if only they weren't so overzealous, there might be a way
can you? you're toooo kind~
being on the same level as screwllum -- who's probably the best in the universe -- is nothing short of spectacular. it's beyond my abilities, computers are not my forte.
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
same as you guys -- on terminals.
the best option was for her to directly interact with humans. there's no need to feel sad, i believe she was content when she left us.
the arbor's rebirth has frightened the elders who lurk behind the scenes they fear the resurgence of abominations, much like what happened thirty years ago.
correct. and it's different from the underground towns you described. the fragmentum there has quite literally torn everything to pieces -- there's no sign of life, despite the monsters.
"monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. what started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
i understand now. you do not really distrust me, you just wish to show your rebellious side.
if anyone happens to find a potential exit, please be sure to take every precaution before exploring further.
the answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
yes. more precisely, it's right below.
amazing, right? and i bet you always say something silly like "rules are made to be broken."
since you are here, do you two want to try feeding the dromases?
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
hmmm honest kid. i know where you are, miss sparkle.
yes, in fact, we were just getting ready to leave.
this place though, is where we can drop our cloaks of pretense, for the waters shall bring us closer together.
you came out here to look for him and remember that friendship, no matter how difficult things got. isn't that right?
and i hope that you can all witness it with me.
if you feel strongly about something, you should speak up and take action. that's the philosophy i live by.
poor little march, being bullied by a mechanical scoring system don't pay them any mind, let's go!
there is no need to be so hostile.
unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. the clamor is not fitting for desserts. by the way
the rules are simple. whoever flies their kite the highest and furthest within the time limit will receive a special honor along with a secret prize.
ugh, i definitely didn't expect him to go that far. thankfully, the wound wasn't too deep, and he just passed out from the pain.
even if we got rid of one bunch of radicals, there are others out there. wiping them out would do more harm than good.
the debt that vache owes to the underworld rests with me. all i can do is help everyone to the best of my ability to the very end.
it will be easier for us to start with someone from inazuma.
sometimes i just put on a wig, change my makeup, and slip on a pair of glasses - just like that, i can go anywhere without a worry~
"the family's protection for penacony has expired. any mishaps in the dreamscape could result in permanent brain death."
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
confidence goes a long way.
although he claims to be a special guest for the irodori festival, he's failed to present his invitation letter. therefore, we can only suspect that he might've entered the country illegally.
if you say so, but you can sneak out for the next sabzeruz festival, right? we'll make sure the next one is a smashing success!
i heard from other alchemists you have a prescription you wish me to assess can you read it to me?
it doesn't matter why grandpa chose that sword, i won't let it fall into anyone else's hands.
mm, i don't blame you for that. a disregard for human life doesn't exactly endear you to other humans
so it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
shangshang is my best friend. aside from my street-performing brothers, she's the person i've known the longest on the luofu. i wanted to become sworn sisters with her, but she didn't seem interested.
most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
you could give him mint plants that you plucked from the side of the road, and he wouldn't even mind.
a newcomer with the cloud knights? *sigh* just go back to where she's from. everything is so competitive here in the luofu. you can't get promoted.
qlipoth the preservation is known for their indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
come quick! i've brought you a shiny little thing. open up the box and take a look!
who cares? we'll round up all of 'em.
so, please allow me to travel with you.
heh, i'm only telling you this so you can properly understand my plan. could you possibly spare the sentimentality for the time being?
remember my adoptive parents i mentioned to you a while ago?
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
since you've got everything ready i say, let grill master dehya take it from here.
so even though my secretaries are very capable and experienced, i still can't help worrying for them a little.
are you alright? are you hurt anywhere? do you feel dizzy? tired? or
i see. but when it's so obvious, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
no, no, she's got skill alright, i can tell she's got training.
many vagrants are staying here temporarily. their homes were overrun by monsters.
no one will disturb us now. here, how about i show you a little magic trick?
if we can make the businesses more profitable, then maybe we have a chance of paying back the ipc?
here we are. this is the place.
hey did you just scare off a fragmentum monster?
to him, being a commentator is just extra work he was roped into. do you guys know of any places he'd go after work?
it is something of a luxury, but i love listening to the rain from the courtyard.
tell me. aren't you and lynette actually from the house of the hearth?
come this way, i'll explain it to you.
very well. i should also return to the knights of favonius headquarters
the memories i have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
good, then i'll also count on you with the preparation of the receptacle.
as hunters, you have proficiency in swordsmanship and fighting by default, so there's no need to allocate any additional skill points to those areas.
having someone by my side calms me -- it's always been the case thank you.
sure, no hurry.
you'd be more likely to see me pulling up outside wanmin restaurant and selling grilled tiger fish from a food cart.
one day, i believe it will overshadow all seven nations.
hmm why won't it
they are confined to the water, and yet they live free, swimming around wherever the mood takes them.
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
naturally, for anyone looking to make a profit in a complex market, the bottom line is having the requisite experience and expertise. all i can do for them is share whatever insight i may have.
perhaps the fact that the aroma of freshly cooked hot food is a welcome change from cold, pre-prepared rations.
hey, where've you been? i've missed you two!
this is amphoreus' flame-chase journey aeur" "a band of heroes dedicated to slaying the gods and reclaiming the twelve coreflames for the world to start over anew."
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
both victory and defeat are part of the journey.
i've heard there are serious incidents unfolding on the luofu. communication with the divination commission's delve has been severed. for your own safety, i'd suggest you remain here.
grandpa always treats me like a child. but come to think of it, at his age, who isn't a child to him?
tsk, trying to worm your way in again, huh? but you won't be able to establish a connection if you know nothing about slumbernana monkey~
may the wind carry our blessings and praise.
uh-huh, that's my pops! he's a good person, alright. everyone around here respects him.
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
the illusion was so impossibly blissful that i realized it was just a dream.
that's strange how did paimon transform into a lavender melon?
we should probably get going. mister dvorak, could you come with me to confirm the site?
as i've said all along, there's much more to idyia than she gives herself credit for. she has a very special power though i think some of us have sensed that already.
if you encounter any difficulties on your travels, feel free to tell me all about them.
not quite yet. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
in the past, we sat in our high chairs in the court, giving our opinions on isolated cases, all while knowing very little about the human stories behind each and every one.
traveler, paimon, do you know this self-proclaimed bard from mondstadt?
but once in a while, it's nice to treat yourself in the company of family.
sure, we have to attend classes sooner or later anyway. dreamweaving class is at the stage plaza. let's go take a look.
still, he's cooperating. he didn't turn down my offer to strike a deal. i'll make sure there are plenty of guards around to keep him safe from anything the fatui might be planning.
people's lives are at stake. why wouldn't you want another person to help? besides, i have some experience with the fragmentums. i'm sure i will be of use.
i could have bought them back, but it's not in my nature to pay twice for the same thing. least of all when they'd be looking to make a handsome profit from my misfortune.
by no means. you wish to know about the stone, i presume? then let me invite the great seafarer, captain beidou, to tell the story aeur" if she would be so kind.
next up is the skill sheet. you have a limited amount of skill points that you can use to learn a number of skills. the more points you invest in a particular skill, the easier it will be to pass associated checks.
since you're here can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
if it were really that profitable, those in the know would have kept it as quiet as possible. you have to wonder, if the news is spreading like wildfire, who's fanning the flames?
you've looked out for me during our travels together these past few days. i'm truly grateful and can't thank you enough.
i know, right? i'll teach them a lesson myself if i catch them in the act, that's for sure.
go ahead and give it a try, little layla. don't worry, the little ones and i will be here to keep you safe.
i've asked the millelith on guard at qingce village to report this to the ministry of civil affairs. they will organize a search around that warehouse.
in fact, by way of thanks, i'd like to invite you to the palace of astrum for tea. it is about time we knew each other better.
...my answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.
when all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved inazuma, forever and ever. isn't that right?
dear, dear. other players lose their games and throw a tantrum you win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
eventually, she became the head of the entire commission, which required her to learn patience and adopt a meticulous approach to her work.
a souvenir for myself? that's definitely an idea i can get behind.
you must have been blessed by many miracles to say that with such unwavering confidence.
be sure to arrive on time. you won't wanna miss the show.
he probably is hopefully, we don't bump into him, but if we do, we'll just have to try and talk to him
consider it his atonement. it's only fair that he had to do something constructive before being able to sleep soundly. seriously, don't waste your concern on him.
i grew them myself, and i've already picked out some good ones.
beelzebul is ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. baal's name was "makoto."
my "origin," huh i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
might i remind you that this is the fatui? have you completely forgotten what they did to us?
traveler, if i'm guessing correctly you were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
i can sympathize with your unhappiness at home, but after you ran away, you ended up at the theater and became one of us.
well done. i admit i underestimated you, but what difference would it make?
come with me. let's find a quiet place. there's something i want to talk about with you.
(oh! do i smell a redemption arc?)
why are you looking at me? want a medal or something? it does kinda sound like a good idea
if what oleg says is true, then svarog is an architect creation leftover from the old era.
where is mavuika right now? did she tell you what she's planning?
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
the soldiers stationed here must have moved these into a roadblock.
i feel very fortunate to be right here, enjoying the fireworks, and enjoying the view of liyue harbor.
you said this was the first step, right? so just how many steps does your training have, exactly?
so, he's recommended three candidates. their names are: qianwei, mingbo, and zhiyi.
remain vigilant at all times. any suspicious movements must be suppressed as quickly as possible before the situation gets out of hand.
i'm sure he didn't get lost. even i was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
march is right, grandpa. i heard the escaped prisoner from the shackling prison is beyond formidable. in case anything goes wrong
if we were to use clockwork toys as an analogy, could it be that the tracks have eroded, or the gears have slid out of place?
stay right there. you have a lot of explaining to do.
i must commend you for your insight in having discerned this principle.
don't worry, i've got enough money with me.
today's work is finished! please make sure to get some rest!
whenever they heard that melody, they would feel like their lives were in danger once again, and flee immediately.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
don't worry, paimon. the shogun's chosen envoy may be strong, but tomorrow's match doesn't prohibit the use of visions. we'll make a formidable team.
mister zubayr has already provided signed copies of all documentation related to our operations. everything is perfectly filled out and valid.
see you when i see you. and happy lantern rite.
although we've been through so much together, i actually know very little about the astral express. i'd like to start visiting more frequently if the opportunity arises.
you seemed to be getting quite into it. what a shame that you didn't manage to go home with anything.
the pastries that the zhuming is known for are mostly salty-sweet or smokey in flavor. so there's no way i can resist this kind of pure sweetness.
when i first set foot in the jade chamber, i stood at the edge of the platform and looked down upon liyue harbor far below.
it's not your first time. i don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
people tell me you're an extremely enthusiastic worker and are very generous with your help.
i caught a glimpse of the mechs in those crates, and they bear a striking resemblance to borisin. i wonder what they're planning this time?
while everyone is talking, you begin to carefully observe the captain's mannerisms.
now the true challenge begins this is where it gets difficult.
huh? wait, you're seriously inviting me?
i asked her to guide me to a place beyond the family's reach and to contact a few trustworthy individuals, namely all of you.
that narrow device it seems to be a buoy.
grandpa said to never be stingy when it comes to making friends. so, how big is your appetite?
ooh, i know! you garden folk have a fondness for mirrors, huh how about letting you enjoy some quality time with your favorite object aeur" a mirror?
lisa heard that i wanted to accompany everyone to the islands, so she prepared this pouch. supposedly, opening it will reveal a new way.
wait you're not asking what the theater does, but what it is.
haha, i'm worried you don't trust her plan. just relax -- little gui is unbeatable in her area of expertise.
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
true. mister svarog is always there for me.
i shall ask you four questions. dishonest answers will cause the golden thread to vibrate, while truthful responses will not affect the thread.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
"the incantation, 'abracadabra,' means 'to create what i say.' this is a world made of words, where fantastical powers can be wielded by all."
i can probably get through everything in two days. as long as i don't sleep.
seems like someone wants to make things difficult for us. let me see if i can pry it open
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
don't worry, little layla. they're just apologizing to me for defeating souka. go buy yourself a nice drink, take a break, and catch your breath.
with you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. if you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move.
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
there's no getting around these things if you wanna survive out there.
times change. suddenly, the lantern rite of today is a wholly different affair from the past.
if you don't believe me, try it for yourself: soon we will face another battle. can you change that possibility?
yeah now that you mention it, this miner's lamp looks really similar to the star on the previous page
this power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
this is one problem that even the musou no hitotachi will not be able to solve.
ooh, she marched off quickly. so cold.
yep! of course, chef yancui will have the final say on what to include in these deals.
she folded the pages of books into small origami animals, gave them life with her magic, and with time, that's how the forest of blessings took shape.
may the wind guide us in saving dvalin.
not much. we just chatted a bit.
oh, as for you the chief will decide your fate when we see him.
okay why?
precisely. according to the rules i designed for her, matters of this nature are to be delegated to the tri-commission.
this is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: weighing your options and making a decision. there are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
after some time, a rich aroma begins to fill the air. even a passing cat can't help but stop in its tracks and look up in anticipation.
how was it? did you enjoy your time on campus?
collei? that's a harsh analogy, where'd all that come from?
svarog claims to be a guardian of humanity -- all the ownerless robots obey his commands. they've occupied the furnace core hub, and they're not letting anyone get close.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
my earliest memories are of living with master. according to her, she saved me from certain people of ill repute. my birth parents had left me behind some time before that.
things in the city and on cyno's side are both going well. the guards that stormed out of the akademiya are all taken care of.
even though the training she subjected me to was strict, she always made sure to take me traveling when she had the time. we met many of her friends during those days that was also how i met mister callas and his family.
but someone didn't agree with that assessment, and it just so happens i was able to fulfill his request.
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
then i'll leave that to you. macaroni's on sale today, so i've got to go. you can just tell me how things went when we discuss tomorrow's plan later.
every year, when the fireworks go off, i say to myself, "another year has already passed."
let alone maintain it. to do that, you must buy a special kind of shrine and worship it properly.
this stool is a piece of evidence, right?
pascal possesses a quality that other small robots lack. it's kind of similar to the emotions we humans have.
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
on the contrary, i apologize for allowing my own personal matters to encroach on your time.
that mister reca said i'm better suited for dreamweaver academy instead of charmony academy.
alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you for now.
great! i look forward to learning from your culinary expertise.
this time we're playing the role of a real detective but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
it's a new game script by the tabletop troupe, a local roleplay adventure club.
a gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. hehe don't you agree?
we shouldn't discuss important matters out in the open.
of course, i still push myself to complete my work when performing my official duties.
true. but in the eyes of the denizens of abundance
i suppose a few games with you won't affect my work.
anyway, i should get back to work here's hoping you keep on winning.
kujou kamaji a descendant of the kujou clan, i presume.
(aw, good thing i made all those preparations. seems the all-nighter i pulled last night is really paying off!)
come onnnn~ together is better!
this is what age does to you. the older you get, the less adventurous you become.
but like i mentioned earlier, we're in a bit of a bind -- we could really use a helping hand.
what an honor! where are my manners -- we can talk about heaters all day if you like. let's have a chat~
looks like everyone can't wait. let's go ahead with that plan, then. i will submit the admission documents to paperfold university. we'll leave once everyone is ready. let's all have some fun.
at the end of each puzzle, you're rewarded with
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be it doesn't seem to have any info on it
speaking of which, mister zhongli, the fireworks show will be particularly exciting this year. please, don't miss it.
i assume you need me to teach you the conduct of the lawrence clan. only then will you finally be able to communicate with my uncle, correct?
alright. i'll leave my cousin to you, then.
i know this is hard, you don't have to be hard-pressed to make a decision. as i have said... the answer is inconsequential.
why would i make this more difficult for you? we're on the same side here.
well, in roleplaying games, the story sometimes changes based on the decisions of the players and the results of the fateometer.
this doesn't feel very "me." is this okay?
i promised to help you and i'll keep my word. nothing to worry about.
hang on, i'm still struggling to understand this. i need you to explain it again
i will hold them back. don't let hoolay escape!
make no haste. since i am now a ninja hero fit to contend with the evil ninja would you let me join you in your crusade?
qingxu pool has always been home to many secrets. plus, azhdaha once wrought havoc there, so there are even more secrets buried deep underground.
for the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices it is the right choice.
yes. idyia had the water droplet send us a message just as the show was coming to an end, so we came back here to wait for you.
belobog has a heating system of its own. however, maintaining a steady indoor temperature has always been a challenge, no matter if it's qlipoth fort or the boulder town clinic.
however, starting tonight, i would advise you to stay at the international trade association.
today, at long last, you and inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
oh, really? well, that's okay. you're still invited to the sabzeruz festival!
my alchemists detected some complex ingredients in his remains, which might explain how these borisin were able to disguise themselves as foxians.
i've always found it hard to handle complex relationships be it cocolia or my family.
we really could use the extra help, especially from capable individuals like yourselves
strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here
let's cut to the chase. before the crisis struck, the astral express was guided here by a stellaron hunter, a wanted felon, in an attempt to resolve the stellaron crisis.
there are wandering monsters nearby -- they'll spell trouble if we let them hang around. go take care of them -- your victory is certain.
according to grandpa's plan, i should seek out the cloud knight soldiers aboard the skysplitter and see if there've been any new developments
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
we don't have much time. if i were you, i'd make a move before it's too late.
the man appears somewhat disgruntled at having been exposed, but soon relents and raises his leg for you to take a better look.
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
keep moving. just walk forward at normal pace and don't do anything to give away that we suspect anything.
yes. i never observed it directly, but i used lab simulations and outbound surveys to establish a rough location.
there is still some preparation to do, but don't worry. everything's on track.
i believe in your potential. it is rare for someone to have such a carefree, optimistic disposition.
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
i returned to the luofu so i could surrender myself to the alliance and atone for my sins.
calm down. the war you speak of is over.
just trust in me, your archon, and do as i say aeur" never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. it'll all turn out fine.
that marked-up map is a map of prisoners' escape routes. vidyadhara craftsmen once made blueprints for the prison's construction, so i imagine, mister taoran, you have a similar map in your possession. this pill --
miss tingyun it's great to see you so happy but i can't help feeling a little sad.
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
i was just out on a shopping trip. i ran out of macaroni, so i went to grab a few more bags.
but there are so many things i still need to do
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
the kujou clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. kamaji is hardly a great heir to the kujou name, but
am i? maybe it's because i had the other shrine maidens leave. anyway, i've always been like this.
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
in the past whenever i heard the sound of those tunes, i always felt that they were worlds apart from me.
deal. well, you guys take your time. everything's all set for the assessments to go ahead.
but if the prophecy will come true, i'll also die anyway, right? so if i've already met you as my magical meeting in this world
she told me that whenever she's feeling troubled, she finds a quiet corner in the artisanship commission and just sits there, letting the sounds wash over her.
the moon is simply magnificent tonight. we mustn't squander it. come, join me for a moonlight stroll aeur" i won't take no for an answer.
the story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. and the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. approved!
if it is to happen sooner or later, i would rather it happen later now, let us both take a step back -- we needn't make this difficult.
he seemed to think those stories were the best things ever, though. he was so into 'em that he'd call the whole brigade over and make them perform the whole thing as a play.
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
thanks for the suggestion, i'll consider it.
i don't know your background, so i can't give you free passage here. besides, yanfei doesn't seem to need your help, does she?
then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began five hundred years ago.
just my conjecture, but i doubt it's far from the truth. my brother mentioned that they've had to use extreme measures to repel the fragmentum monsters.
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
the key is that the plane of euthymia represents ei's inner world. defeat her there and you may well have the chance to shake the raiden shogun's will.
take a deep breath, as if you're about to blow up a huge balloon. exhale all your sleepiness into it, and then, poof aeur" it's now flying away!
little one, the pairings for the remaining thirty-two are out.
oh, hehe hopefully you'll be the last one i meet for a while then
she must think the outcome of her death is worth it.
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
oh? i didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. you wouldn't mind it if i took a soak for a while, would you?
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
just some suggestions at the memory level. if something happens in everybody's memory then that something becomes a fact.
already thinking about taking time off? any excuse for a party, huh
ohhh, i've met them, alright. one time, i wore a weeping mask and snuck into their troupe.
if i'm not mistaken, the two of you just rushed over here from the history and culture museum? i appreciate your coming here on such short notice.
it was unfortunate that you didn't register for the tournament as well.
it's probably more accurate to say this was never a real scripted story to begin with.
what about all the unresolved emotions of the parties involved? what happens to them?
we're gonna need to get you a front page news story for this one. heck, let's get some billboards!
unsurprisingly, the communications zone is where a bridge for communication will be formed between droidhead and the space station.
i understand. i'm sorry for dragging you into this mess
when i found myself bored with little to do, i would skim through the various books we had lying around the house.
for beings transformed by the abundance, there's a difference. do you know how abominations of abundance and xianzhou people differ?
any organization doing something like that is interested in more than just "mutual aid"
so, be a good girl, padisarah, and help out grandpa almond whenever you can, alright?
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
alright, how about this we'll work with what we have. i'll give you some scenarios, and see if your work is up to my standards.
continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. everything we do is for the citizens of the underworld. that passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
it's okay! phew, this one's strong alright!
i promised her that i would help her rebuild the connection between the overworld and the underworld, that's all.
it turns out that there is still another piece to the story of kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
we both came from the overworld. maybe that's why we're so eager to turn back the clock -- to return to when life below ground was no harder than life on the surface.
yes. congratulations on your victory, sangonomiya kokomi.
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
don't move. i've seen eremites get struck by lightning before. you need to rest.
allow me to introduce myself. i'm lingsha, cauldron master and head of the alchemy commission on the luofu.
were were you upset, clorinde?
the charmony festival? heh, you think you can scare me? you think i've no idea what you're planning?
interesting, don't you think? i fulfill people's desires and grant them favors, and soon, they come back to me with even greater desires.
on behalf of the people of mondstadt, please offer your windblume to the statue.
phainon's words have convinced me to make an exception for you. whether you stay or go after this is for you to decide.
still there is one other thing on this topic that i suspect you may be curious to know.
he's the reincarnation of imbibitor lunae, and the person behind him is the newest member of the crew. i've heard a lot about you.
officially, the assessment is already over, and i'll be expected to announce the results before long. so we have to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can.
we're almost there everyone, stay close.
as i explained, wangsheng funeral parlor was, once upon a time, more akin to a doctor's office than an actual funeral parlor.
can you stop conflating the show on stage with your real-life relationships in the troupe?
this isn't right. please let him go.
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory
if i roll a one, three, or five, you have to confess. you have to tell me a secret that no one else can ever be allowed to know.
does it look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
even though sweet dreams are nice, they're just illusions. but for him, they're the only way to survive, even if it means giving up on reality that's not really living at all.
what's her deal? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
actually, she's been quite diligent in her swordplay practice and hasn't taken many breaks lately. i think she deserves a day off.
remember what i said? you sigonians are better off hiding in the sewers
well, it means you'll soon end up like her, unable to speak ever again.
besides, these lakes only exist for a short time before they're buried by sand, so you can't use them as landmarks.
since you are already familiar would you mind also showing me the rules sometime?
in bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. also, sales for the book would only increase further.
wait, three? there is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? wait it's
i will employ every means at my disposal to save amphoreus, elder caenis. whether it means wresting it from the grasp of the gods
see! that was easy.
i have loved that song since i was small.
(he's started talking about procedural stuff, so i need to focus on)
i'm looking at the reply -- see, here. miss hanya said she's on her way.
but without my uncle as their puppet, there'd be no use in them attacking the city.
what are you all huddled together over here for? the adeptus left already.
hmm generally speaking, this should be the point where the script writer gives the players some kind of hint, or gives the gm some kind of code for how to move forward.
you should still check the expiration date for things like rubbing alcohol. if it's expired, it won't be effective.
besides, if i can get the hang of this teapot trick, i'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever i go
in fact, i've already had several troupes approach me for the fontinalia film festival. unfortunately, the scripts were all pretty boring, and didn't pique my interest.
no, there can't be mister svarog is healthy, his system is always being maintained.
oh, you're right! that wasn't there when we arrived!
so whenever i feel overwhelmed, i come here to just lose myself in a book and relax for a while
i think i understand what kouzen means when he says it's too late.
see those marks on the dummy? those are the result of several days' worth of practice.
i'll make this quick. just one question: what did he buy while he was here?
the goal is to see how much mora we can make under these conditions.
the embodiment of strife telling me about the majesty of the world? what an irony
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
it's alright, don't worry. there just seems to be some kind of misunderstanding here. why don't you take this opportunity to clear it up? don't you think that'd be best?
it's like weaving brocade -- you and i can only add one gold thread each time, but eventually, we will make a gorgeous pattern.
my "own" way ha, i don't even remember what kind of life i want.
if we catch lady bailu, will luxie really follow her into our trap? do heliobi really have a sense of loyalty to their victims?
however there's a problem that needs to be resolved before it can open to the public.
i will be eagerly awaiting your visit. it would be wonderful if you could visit my home and enjoy a taste of our tea and desserts.
i agree with your hypothesis, and just now i confirmed it myself.
about your childhood? no, nothing at all.
(no, that's ridiculous, don't be silly i bet ororon sold me out, the little scamp)
bronya's a good kid -- you can tell she learned a lot from cocolia. *sigh* it's been a while since we saw each other. i miss her.
zubayr theater exists for them for every single one of us!
i don't enjoy fish. there's too many bones, and i can't stand the smell maybe it's because i had my fill of fish as a child.
i do, but if i ask, then you must reply.
a wool scarf, which from the looks of it probably belonged to a woman, and a hair clip why are these things here?
should be. i don't think they have enough manpower left to post guards and defend their perimeters.
oh, yeah. he's a student at the akademiya. we met during the last interdarshan championship. he was representing the vahumana darshan.
but i've always regarded it as nothing more than the source of my loneliness.
ugh, it's ghostly grove, not ghastly gravy!
i've got more than a dozen siblings! one of them is my older brother -- he's also living on the xianzhou. his name is langshile, but he seems to prefer being called "lancelot."
our objective is to deal with three of the four temples.
for sure. you have a unique constitution and a lot of potential. with your strength, wielding a baseball bat is no problem at all.
so, you're saying even though grandpa knew it was a cursed sword, he still chose it to be a prize because he thought it wouldn't cause any trouble?
so far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream.
it is said that the space station also contains madam herta's private chamber where her most precious, rare, and dangerous collections are sealed... and for someone like her, it's not out of the realm of possibility.
distinguished guests, since you have spared no effort in aiding the holy city, i will naturally take care of you as well.
we've had to fight every step of the way for this opportunity, but we now have all of the ingredients necessary to stage a truly spectacular performance:
in this story, everyone is a marechaussee hunter. to reflect this, the club has prepared a small badge for everyone.
since you're here i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
i'm just here to try something new. there's no fun in reading the same kind of thing over and over again. relax, it's just words on a page, isn't it? what could i misunderstand, really?
i don't think we have to be too self-conscious, but it's still something to keep in mind.
sorry, i'm afraid there's not much i can do for you -- our task this time is just to "place" the target properly.
i must give him a chance, seele, because other people can't.
i'd give it a ninety percent chance.
then let's go. we can find somewhere to sit down and talk. food and drinks are on me.
wait, what do you mean, "as long as i don't sleep"?
the scissor-tailed swallow is the most classic design. it symbolizes good fortune and joyful tidings. different colors also have small variations in meaning.
general feixiao just slipped out of the recovery room. she thinks she's so sneaky, but i know everything that happens in the alchemy commission.
economic cooperation between our islands has suffered greatly as a consequence. few merchants are now willing to engage in inter-island commerce.
when are you planning to head back? do you need us to escort you?
gotta say though, i didn't expect you to go on a whole undercover mission during the few days i was gone. sounds like you were really putting your necks on the line, no?
i have an agreement with the titan the chrysos heirs will take away their coreflame and use it to start a bright blaze that'll illuminate our path onward.
oh, that shouldn't be a problem. when we get back to the tournament venue, i'll ask a member of the genius invokation tcg society to provide one for you.
the vision hunt decree was obviously devised as a means of manipulating the shogun, the ones behind it knowing full well her susceptibility as a puppet with a single-minded focus on eternity.
huh! what you're saying is quite different from what her dual swords have been saying to me.
wait, don't steal all the fried vegetables. leave some for me! hey!
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but
i command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. rest well tonight.
of course, i know everyone here. on penacony, anyone could be lying but the remembrance does not lie.
as i expected, it's come to your attention too. the memoria nearby has been mutating ever since slumbernana monkey gained popularity.
hmm out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine!
you're way too modest! just now, i actually felt really self-conscious when paimon talked about us in the same breath.
i'll come with you. it can't hurt to have a magical fairy tag along, right?
talent? you'd be dead if it weren't for those two travelers. do you think stealing a starskiff and taking to the skies is a show of talent? what about being trapped by abominations?
and so when he learned this piece of information, he realized that the victim had created their own locked-room mystery.
look down there. see the mess that remains of those old stalls? that's rivet town's market. the supplies natasha wants are probably there.
and with that, marcel's motive has now been established
then who should we blame? the ipc?
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way)
your performance at the theme park was wonderful and grandiose... a simple yet practical technique that fooled almost everyone.
hiding something extraordinary with something extraordinary this is pretty herta. i assume you know what to do? i mean, you've read that catalog for quite a while.
no, not at all. the purpose of the trip is to relax, after all. simply do as you please.
you know what? he's got me excited too let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
yawning without covering your mouth? uncouth. i will pardon your rudeness this time. good morning to you, too.
yeah, it hurt. what, something you want to experience for yourself?
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
seems like the smoke is getting thinner
oh, i beg to differ! the first meal i ate in liyue harbor was at wanmin restaurant. xiangling's cooking gave my tastebuds plenty to be excited about!
well whatever they are, they're not good enough.
they bicker and fight, but they'll always be your biggest supporters.
leyla must have used this as his medium. it would definitely explain how a spirit-duffer like him was able to trigger a clairvoyant experience.
is that so? well, before you leave, i recommend listening to mister xiyan's legend of the high-cloud quintet.
ask, and i shall answer to the best of my ability.
i read that a stellaron's internal fluctuations will cause a fragmentum to appear.
that was just to help with the spell shoot, i still hear you
i'm afraid that sooner or later, they are going to find you here. time is starting to run out.
but these problems disappeared all but completely after the battle against osial.
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
no, i'm still going to melt down this sword!
so, miss navia was right the goddess of prophecy didn't tell us anything about the future.
you are phainon and mydei's companion. so long as they're willing to entrust you with their lives, my trust in you doesn't matter.
but, the closer we get to the final battle, the more worried i feel you have an ancient name now, but the ode of resurrection only takes effect if you win.
so, there is a dish that tastes even better than onigiri? then i shall be sure to remember its name.
if you don't take the payment now, i'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the arataki gang.
i knew you'd pick the right flowers. mom and dad will be so happy.
pascal's trail leads in that direction. let's follow it.
i'm sure, and i'm going. you know that i don't like to pass up any opportunity to dance, and this one is especially important.
so, you're not a participant? you look like you know your way around a fight.
these are all charred remains?
are you still continuing down this path? this is a rare opportunity. leaving here will also mean leaving the truth.
just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend -- people of all kinds that carried the will of the aeons.
let's start with pascal. we found him first, after all. also, like mister svarog warned, if he's not supervised, he might cause trouble
i can tell you what the future holds: if you don't go to the luofu, the stellaron will eventually contaminate the entire ship, and over half of the inhabitants will perish.
each of us has our own past and destined ends. and on this journey, we have been invited by diamond to join him.
thinking back, that trip to see the void song whales was one of the turning points which set me on the path to becoming a fighter pilot. life truly is full of wonders
my wish has not changed to this very day. however, it is not only out of consideration for myself that i have built the jade chamber anew at this time.
alright, dismissed. go and report to general gorou. and remember there can be no more insubordination.
i know it's hard to believe, but ever since i forged this sword, i've been able to hear the thoughts of all sorts of weapons.
is something wrong? the sprite is only halfway through the story, but i seem to be detecting some distress and unease.
alright, alright, i get it. you won over the big bad director with your superstar aura. you don't have to show off.
the same beauty is found in all forms of art. whether it's a dance or a gemstone, you use the same pair of eyes to admire it, right?
if it were anyone else, i'd have to refuse but even the almighty shogun has recognized your abilities, traveler. i'm happy to assign this task to you.
the guards lock the cell door and leave without looking back.
look, there are two braziers on that wall. could they be some sort of hint?
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
that must be the first step in their mind control process. you were lucky.
but the future is still clear -- the real test lies ahead the young swordmaster of the cloud knights. he will not be an easy foe.
so be it. well then, you who would defy eternity time for you to enlighten me.
of course we included paimon. this is the story of everyone's big, happy adventure with dodoco.
first, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
lamentable my ninja speed isn't fast enough to outrun cause and effect.
as for the two foreign warriors select one to accompany you, phainon. placing both esteemed guests on the front line would not be proper.
yaoyao, thank you for bringing my herbs. i will make sure to take them.
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again and such a tragedy must never recur.
um i know you're working hard for the people down here, but mister svarog doesn't trust human emotions. he only trusts his calculation results.
if i hear any strange new rumors after this, you will be my number one suspect.
so, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
should we really be charging over there? even without a heliobus, yanqing is a swordsmaster among swordsmasters.
before you lies the city's central square. you see a man with a slightly anxious look on his face pacing back and forth, his head hanging low.
are you suggesting that there are people trying to understand hoolay's secrets and use them for their own purposes, just like with this mech?
a dreamchaser story if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
i don't need any help here, why don't you try asking someone else?
so the ei of the present planted the sacred sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the inazuma of the past
don't worry, i'll do something about it. let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
that is a pity, but we can only continue to move forward.
all that talk about making up for my losses was really just to console myself.
thanks for the help, mister farhad, but let me make one thing clear first: don't try to ask about what's in the new show.
but in my experience, family issues can be the toughest to resolve.
my brigade is called the "blazing beasts." we're not a large group, but every member is loyal and brave.
well, let's not just stand here twiddling our thumbs. actors, to the makeup booth. we'll start on the next scene as soon as we get a working kamera.
the ten-lords commission will support your decision with everything we have, general.
i must apologize for your long wait, honored guests.
how should i put this there's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
you may have won the battle, but i shall win the war.
we investigated so quickly that perhaps we've missed a thing or two along the way. let me activate deduction mode and consider things again from the top to see if we can find anything new.
firstly, your trial of the heart! you went to professor capote and asked him to simulate conversations with you so you could better understand your boss.
well, i guess i can't get you the stars, or the moon. but pretty much anything else.
here, take this letter of complaint, it's written against you. please consider carefully what to do with it, i do not wish to see another one. understood?
so is that a real thing?
i remember yanqing once said, "there are many ways to defeat villains, but if you want to become a true hero, you have to focus on self-improvement."
something is wrong. the guards aren't responding
once you get to know him, you'll realize that he's actually a big softie at heart. he'll even help out with furniture repair and painting the stage!
you're right maybe we should contact miss qingque and warn her not to go to work today.
sure enough the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
taking all that into account, did we get lucky, or was aurum alley always destined to pull through?
treating you to some food is but a small token of our appreciation.
every journey into the unknown is a mystery waiting to be solved. but often, it is encounters with the unexpected that make the journey all the more interesting.
(that look in his eyes it's like he became an entirely different person as soon as i defeated him.)
you must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
i'm just following the doctor's advice. miss bailu said i could take a stroll, so here i am.
with the monsters gone, the small protrusion now awaits your discovery, poking out of the ground like a shy flower bud.
you've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
haha, i wanna see the stellaron too, y'know -- it was my research topic for over a decade. you don't get that many decades in life.
i've been meaning to come see you for some time now, but work kept getting in the way, and i simply couldn't find the time regardless, i just knew i had to come thank you in person.
you don't need to worry about me. oleg guaranteed that i wouldn't be harmed. he seemed like a man of his word. go and rest.
don't worry about that for now. you know what kind of punishment you'll face once we report you to the corps, i assume?
and this only makes me all the more excited to meet with them.
ugh the syrup has turned clumpy i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
based on what i have seen today, i am forced to accept that inazuma is a completely different place from the one i remember.
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
uh-huh anyway, what are you gonna do now, hm? hack an ipc branch nearby and get your accounts back?
unsheathing this sword without merit is to blaspheme the divine will of the reignbow arbiter, and invite calamity.
thank you. i don't have any further questions.
speak quickly, unless you want to earn yourself a one-way ticket to coupon-town.
now that i've benefited from your experience, i'll try to follow your instructions the next time i'm attempting optimizations on the shogun.
uncle tian is too modest. he's been around for a long time. there's no one who can replace a person of such noble character.
though they are unable to return to mondstadt and spend the festival with us, the weinlesefest will nonetheless be a major event that all of mondstadt is looking forward to.
never. and although my mother and father passed away many years ago, both my brother and i are familiar with the vast majority of their acquaintances.
hmm, so in the end, we still have to start by talking to neuvillette
humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. they cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
this projector is a limited-edition version custom-made for the museum -- the only one of its kind in the whole of belobog. it can produce images with a resolution of up to
you saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. after leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
if general huaiyan hadn't arrived in time, i probably wouldn't be here talking to you now.
so if you don't mind, i'll go and take a look at the other patients?
well, i do know about the box and the cursed sword.
just some shallow intuition anyway, let's report back to the sheriff for now.
but how will i do this? a human assuming the role of a god without being exposed
i'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. i, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. i'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
to reciprocate, in the upcoming confrontation, if the odds aren't in the astral express' favor... i will stand with you.
there's no end to this. let me try.
sorry, but could you give me a few more minutes?
so the legends say, but who knows if it's true.
i understand thanks, master gongshu!
no sleep for you either, huh?
keep him with you. do not let him slip away.
so that's it even the villains in opera performances rarely go that far
for the holy city, i am willing to bear all the traits that others despise and use every heartless yet effective trick in the book.
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
huh? so, you're the appointed ones this time?
i'm afraid i haven't had much exposure to technical fields -- perhaps she has a better theoretical understanding than myself.
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
yes, that sums it up very well. most people looking to buy my time are businesspeople who believe that whatever they spend now, they will make back several times over in due course.
but be careful not to get launched into the air or frozen while fighting. that would be most unsightly.
so herta hides her collection with something as simple as this?
hah, the brainwashing is strong with this one.
i think we can leave things there for today. once i get back, i will conduct a thorough investigation into the tenryou commission's internal issues.
is that so very well. then please speak, witness of teyvat, my accuser and fated opponent.
if there were no injured animals, that means there was no war, which means the world is at peace.
so is this a real musket?
i don't know whether you can tell, but the years of suffering and loneliness aren't the only reason i have a hard time facing up to who i used to be.
mercs camping in the wild rely on banners and weapon racks to protect themselves.
i wish i could tell you, but i still haven't figured out what it is.
let me take a look. i can sense a spirit being drawn to the relic
imagine if we didn't suspect anything. by the time zhiyi recommends the blackcliff forge for the excavation project, at most we would maybe do a fresh background check on the place.
apologize for what? you know, you and me have a lot in common. i'm almost a grown-up now, but i still miss my childhood days and running about barefoot.
yeah, i heard one male voice and one female, so it should have been the two of them. they really were just talking about brewing tea.
experiments can always be repeated, but humans cannot be brought back to life.
uh hah, good question! so, actually, we're affiliated with the ten--
not at all. you don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. all you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
hearing urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. in return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
it appears so. i'm not sure what he's trying to say though.
because other than me, there's only one person left.
these mara-struck soldiers don't appear to be escaped prisoners.
huh? i can't see the memory storage for this terminal
the air is fresh and the environment is restful.
no need to beat around the bush, sir.
not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
given the situation on the luofu, those on the yaoqing are concerned about hoolay's imprisonment. i'm afraid that the routine visit every century is no longer sufficient to ease their concerns.
then i've something private to take care of regarding that galaxy ranger. let's leave things there, shall we?
you're still the same -- carefree as always.
i swear by this sword, victory shall be yours.
so, you do have a brain somewhere in all that muscle.
hold on a moment. is this satisfying salad also something that amber ordered?
goodness. are people in liyue really so complex these days?
i mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. you don't need to look after me
lady guuji. here i am, as promised. rest assured i came here alone and told no one about this trip.
asta provided financial assistance to a few exceptional children -- i assume arlan was one of them.
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
but as a warrior, i look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
i'm yae miko, a light novel editor aeur" purely out of personal interest, and right now, what i'm most interested in is you nice to meet you. the pleasure is all mine.
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact
perhaps it's the first time you're hearing that title to put it simply, i'm the person currently in charge on watatsumi island, which is also the home front of the resistance.
that indulgent feeling of being spoilt for choice between countless different varieties that, to me, is the appeal of shopping.
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
illustrious names? uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
yeah i just think if you've got something to say, there's no point mincing your words.
no need to be humble, you took great risks for the xianzhou. i saw what you did.
you flatter me. this is a sky-faring commission affair, yet the two of you had to put yourselves in harm's way. i am ashamed.
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
this body is an assistant to the one within. but it is also the guardian of the rules.
countless cloud knights lost their lives or became mara-struck during the crisis. the hall of karma couldn't take them all in, and so they passed away.
congratulations. you attained your very first victory in this tug of war. it's a good start.
we worshiped idrila, the aeon of beauty. we vowed to guard their beauty with the sword, but one day they suddenly disappeared.
i couldn't have backed down, could i? besides, we got him good.
(just a little more. zubayr theater isn't just a performance venue to us)
she obviously doesn't understand what that word means
anyway, people seem to be behaving in a very orderly fashion. i don't see the liveliness you spoke of anywhere.
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
so many stars who are they shining for?
beacon of the trailblaze
i hate to say it, but if you can teach me that move, i'll maybe admit that you're just a tiny little bit stronger than me
whaaeur"? there might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
it's just i thought that silvermane guards were all cold and unfeeling -- they left the underworld to perish. but she doesn't give me that impression.
wildfire can provide that while svarog is recovering.
the engine of creation sadly, i never got the chance to see the robot myself.
she wanted me to stand next to her, but i'm glad i stuck to my guns. besides, i'm not sure i could handle that many people staring at me.
great. and thanks to you for a smooth and pleasant journey, mister wheel.
it was as if i'd lost the thing that was most important to me.
take it easy and relax. deep breath, in and out. once you've taken a long exhale, calmly tell everyone what you want to say.
and perhaps the grownups among us could refrain from acting like children?
i'm fine, really. i just got into a few skirmishes down in the underworld, but nothing i couldn't handle.
as a matter of fact there is something i've been planning for a while now.
according to the survey results, the stellaron is likely to the north of belobog somewhere in the vast snow plains.
what!? no! there was a freezing chill, not to mention the way they drifted through the air they were legit ghosts! anyway, the key point was
y'know what, you're right -- we should work these things out on our own
but because of my bloodline, i was always going to end up being the divine priestess sooner or later. like it or not, it's just the way it is.
is that mister giovanni?
i told you, gepard, the barrier hasn't been fixed yet! don't try and be a hero!
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
it's alright. miss sigewinne really put in a lot of effort.
i'm also hoping sakujirou won't have to use it. it's just there as a last resort.
our first priority is finding the thief and recovering the stolen item, but we don't even have a suspect yet that's why this case is such a conundrum for the silvermane guards.
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
that's probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
and what did you do? you messed it up and ended up as their prisoner. i told you to make friends with a mute, not become one yourself. you really let me down.
in their words, one gig sets you up for half a year. just one job like this nets them enough mora to take it easy for a while.
what are you staring at me for? go on, go get on with your cooking.
ah, it has been some time since i've attended a festival fortunately, i brought sake with me.
if he had just become a regular doctor, there would have been no issue. after all, the wangsheng funeral parlor wasn't unlike a regular doctor's clinic in the early days.
even a judge knows her! her reputation sure does precede her
oh? so now that "survival" won't convince us, you want to talk about "interests"?
it appears we are all present. the spiritfarers who were supposed to report to huohuo mentioned they didn't see her today.
...first, don't you want to know my name?
they may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. i need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
i have high hopes, though. this seems like miko's style, so i'm sure the stories are very entertaining.
*sigh* it's been such a long journey, but now we're finally gonna meet some cloud knights! i'll be back with my unit!
hey, ms. linlang, sorry to bother you aeur" zhiyi ordered a wineware set from you not long ago, right?
from now on, no matter where you may go, no matter what hardships you may encounter as long as i am alive, the luofu will always be an open harbor to you
the akademiya's grip isn't long enough to reach all the way to port ormos, so the city's a little more laid back, meaning the population's also a mixed bag. you never know who you'll meet there.
so they were the ones that corrupted and tampered with the settings of my puppets?
in the meantime, i'll follow up on the exhibit theft case. i wonder if any new clues were found over in svarog's domain
that is not a "figurine." it's a statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder. do i make myself clear?
my guess is that it's because we had communications with many worlds before the eternal freeze. luka, have you heard of the story of igor haft?
"whenever a dispute arises, protection of your family's prestige and dignity always takes precedence."
he allows you to apply a poultice of specialized medicine to the wound, and it appears to bring him much relief. the tension in his brow eases.
march seventh just showed me some dolls that were made to look like the members of the express crew. they're adorable.
it's a nice feeling just like the one i had before.
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
the remains of the swarm author?
i wouldn't worry. it's all work you'll be quite familiar with aeur" planning trips, gathering pertinent information, that sort of thing.
delivering a high volume of packages isn't a problem for me, youkai's legs are naturally fast after all.
the omamori from the grand narukami shrine are very potent indeed. i thought i'd put one aside for you.
all of you, stay focused. i'm right behind you.
ugh, where's the pin? is there anything those vagrants won't steal?
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
i suppose the things that are common knowledge to us are just a garbled mess to you. if we want to straighten out the threads of this world, perhaps i should explain things to you myself.
but if that's all it is, there's also no reason to go so far as to demolish the theater.
it should be a view i tire of seeing, but it always leaves me in awe the heavens really are boundless.
alright, i gotta cheer up! i can't waste everyone's words of encouragement!
and it's not that i don't understand where he's coming from. i just want him to look out for himself, too!
alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. there is no need to state your name. just be off with you aeur" do not distract me from my performance.
what's happening? is the girl in trouble?
come on, let's get back to yanshang teahouse.
all kinds of sights: a lush forest after a cooling rain, green pastures and little foxes
but the fireworks
*yawn* of course, the silver lining is i don't have to go on as many trips anymore.
as a guuji, there's one thing i know very well: people believe whatever they want to believe. some things you do not see, simply because you do not wish to look.
relax, you've got me. just bring me along the next time you go to the desert, and i'll handle everything for ya.
as i said, master was rather inexperienced in the ways of raising children. she believed trial and error was the best way to teach a child what they're capable of.
i sent him to look into zhiyi's regular contacts. since zhiyi likes fishing, wupei thought he might know some of the fishermen and sailors, so he took a boat out to sea to ask around.
an assassin known for purging the chrysos heirs. i am aware.
alright, i'll stand next to you and monitor your connection to the ley lines. it shouldn't take long, but you need to look out for one thing.
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
in other words, the gates' locations are subject to change over time.
all i know is that deshret's relics must be destroyed.
people use fireworks to remember their most precious memories, and these memories sparkle and shine each time the fireworks fly.
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, i'll correct you. and if you're ever stuck in a rut, i'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
but when the kids asked me about it, i didn't wanna break it to them. i just told them that it looks cute, likes to play pranks, and doesn't hurt people.
it sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. but it won't end there. they are not the type to forgive and forget.
the night market sells grilled insects! wanna give them a try?
oh? who permitted you to come onto this stage? now, i understand your admiration for my august self, but i must ask you to keep to the rules.
oh, remember that big one that went up first? the gold one?
i take it this monster is whom i had the pleasure of meeting last time.
man, march seventh -- that's such a beautiful name! i'll make sure to remember it!
that's not the only one. look at them. #seven thousand, six hundred thirty-one and #ten thousand, one hundred thirty-six are affected too.
perhaps this was another sealed location, but an undocumented one what could be in here?
i don't often feel tired. seeing the mora come in has a way of making me feel quite invigorated.
my clan has practiced magic for generations and has created some catalysts that only we know how to use.
i see that's a pity. have you considered starting one?
great, having another trick up my sleeve gives me more flexibility in rapidly changing circumstances.
please, the honor is all mine. i was profoundly moved to hear about your troupe and your wonderful director. i just wanted to do something to help.
no, mother would never do that to me there's no way she would.
and we've already defeated florian, right? so, he won't try to take it from us anymore.
it just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
i know she's used to going into the snow plains alone for research, and we've always believed she can protect herself
this guy is really into these puppets.
but of course. that's why i'm here waiting for you.
that lively young lady told me some things about you
besides, we're here to procure information, aren't we?
recover those cherished recollections and enshrine them in a land of purity. in doing so, all will be preserved from true oblivion.
yes. be careful, and do not act rashly.
one bowl of ramen shouldn't hurt, right?
but what about the rest?
but when i'm with you, i'm now able to unwind.
hmm? oh, it's the traveler and paimon and xiangling.
so i want to draw up a training schedule for you and march!
of course, i didn't want to make things too difficult, so i spun you a broad web wasn't that nice?
who's this? herta?
we are entrusted by the people to loyally see out their wishes. wangsheng funeral parlor is special, in that it carries a dual responsibility, to those both of this realm, and the next.
ahem, alright! then the matter's settled! now that everything's been taken care of, there's no reason for us to keep looking all gloomy and grumpy.
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
i've seen a lot and it's made me think a lot i really can't praise it highly enough. i hope i will remember it for a long time to come.
as long as we can gain access permissions to the hub, we can operate the gear bridge terminals.
the old folks aren't very mobile, so c'mon, let's help them out. we'll get rid of the weeds first and then deliver the pickled radish.
this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
bronya? are you okay?
eh, might as well then, i suppose. actually, do you have a towel? i would like to dry my hair.
i'm so grateful that miss navia was so understanding. to be perfectly honest, i didn't know if i was ready to meet her.
miss topaz, i know you've done a lot of research into belobog. i was wondering if there was any information on the engine of creation in your records?
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
the construction of the new jade chamber is now officially complete. once the tethers are released, it will soar into the sky.
but now, it seems like this attitude is changing. people are starting to believe that engaging with the arts can help them balance their moods, and through that, improve their research efficiency at work.
and that's how the clash started. now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
traveler, please feel free to explore. i'll be at the ready if there is any sign of danger.
not only have they targeted merchant caravans and ordinary citizens, but other mercenary brigades as well.
not really. if i ever get stressed, i just go hunting.
don't worry, i had already foreseen this.
this handwritten fan reply card!
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid i can't even imagine what it must look like.
huh? strange, i remember no such thing.
albedo, is that you? come in.
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
hmm, don't think there's anything here how about we check out somewhere else?
reminds me of me and my brother -- sort of a love-hate relationship.
what would you do if a sum of mora like that suddenly landed in your lap?
your arrival is timely -- this dreamscape is fraught with danger. since our destination is the same, how about we join forces?
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
don't worry about that. tribbie and i will do our best to protect the people of our holy city.
we didn't speak all that much you know how it is, i can only talk to dad for so long before i start losing it.
many people dread the sound of thunder to me, it sounds fondly familiar.
as a champion duelist, i've fought many battles, and taken a countless number of dishonored lives.
no, we're still not quite there.
he informs you of the locations of the monsters, and a glimmer of hope returns to his eyes.
traveler, you are quite close to keqing, why don't you try talking to her? maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
thank you. it's a lot to handle, but i'm sure you can manage.
for example wenyuan. shanghua.
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
alright, i'll leave you to fine-tune your musical while i go and procure a stage.
does it feel like the skysplitter has slowed down? could it be
are you saying you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and is hiding something from us?
is it true that hilichurls grow stronger from eating sunsettias? surely it should be some sort of meat, at least?
though, snezhnaya's fatui are known to be the most aggressive diplomats in teyvat
in other words, if we hold here, there's nothing worse to come, right?
seems to me that it's been created using some illusory magic hidden behind it lies a passageway.
the official name is the "ten-lords commission special operations team for the heliobi containment breach incident."
c'mon, who knows if you'll get a chance like this again!
his scent is so faint it's almost imperceptible, but it also carries a pungent smell of rust. he must have many stories to tell.
why do i keep bumping into you? are you stalking me or something?
yes. for a chef as accomplished as yourself, getting to the finals should be a breeze.
at the time i was in such a hurry that i didn't hear the whole mystery. i tentatively speculated that the murderer had killed the victim the night before, but hadn't locked the door from the inside.
anyway, that's not the important part! it's about mavuika's death aeur" her fate hasn't changed at all.
wow. good guess yes, i want to know for sure whether sacrificing one of the participants is a necessary part of the method or not. i figured she might know.
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes" i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
i know that, gepard. don't worry, i've thought this one through for a change.
uhh, that was me copying video titles from the hottest streamers on the luofu i heard they help attract more viewers.
it seems like the previous owner was stuck here forever, too.
hehe, you should prepare yourself. i certainly won't go easy on you.
h--hey! i'm not always like this! it's all because of that cursed sword
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time train or no train.
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
not only do they not smile, they are also bitter, grumpy, and weep in sorrow all the time.
why don't we look around here first? i've been wanting to see the "zubayr theater," anyway.
however, i feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so i used the identity of the shogun.
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
then why exactly... do we even walk towards the light?
but what if they and we aren't really that special?
legend has it the wind was unusually strong on that day, too
remember, this is a race against the clock. a rare opportunity presents itself to you do not let somebody else snatch it from your grasp.
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
it wasn't until i held guyun in my hands that i could sense its thoughts and unspoken words.
oh wow, it's already so late. everyone's probably running low on food and water aeur" it'll only get harder from here on out.
if she has nowhere else to go after leaving the theater, she might go back and strike out on her own again.
alright. deoteria, is it? how is your son's illness?
...by the way, would you like something to drink? before we go, how about two cups of wake the heck up...? no, four cups.
allowing the rite of parting to take place was also meant to buy some time for us to take control of liyue's administration
since you've spent the whole night thoroughly investigating this situation, i can think of no one else more suitable to gain his trust than you.
next up let's interview those two over there.
in other words, it's like a bond!
they embody life's delights and pleasures, but are equally fragile and short-lived... such regret is inevitable, so let it be.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
hehe. don't forget we have a lunch later. save some space, or you might miss out on some even better food.
watatsumi island's people yearn for peace because they have long since given all they had to the war effort. they are tired of treading water, and don't need you dragging them back underneath once again.
i'm concerned my stress may even be starting to somehow affect you as well
maybe it's because she left home early she realizes that dreams, while enchanting, are ultimately just that -- dreams.
if it came to it, i could always destroy another jade chamber.
then it seems like we've reached a consensus. i have a feeling that this will turn out to be the most mesmerizing performance of your lives.
i didn't expect someone who can't even hold onto his sword to actually have some skill.
so, have you thought up what you'd like to say, boss?
magic words? but, how am i supposed to know what the goddess said to bring them to life?
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
hehe, that's our seele. nothing if not punctual. so, did you find any usable supplies?
as her erstwhile closest friend ei handed it over to me, and i've kept it in the grand narukami shrine ever since.
as adventurers, you two will doubtlessly travel to many more lands and see many more things.
kouichi just bursts out laughing and says actually, this is one of his carpenter friends. turns out he's a lot younger than he looks aeur" just a few years older than me.
we just taught you a lesson, but clearly, you weren't paying attention.
i'm sleepy little gui, what kind of magical elixir did you take to make you so energetic?
so, the intruders and hoolay are holding the yaoqing messengers hostage.
or i can just give you the mastery mark, up to you.
creatures like you don't understand humans.
in the end, we still came full circle.
consuming it will make your body light, agile, and promote longevity and well-being. as a nameless, it'll make your journey a much less arduous one.
ah looks like the next part of our script is here.
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
why, i wouldn't miss it for the world -- seeing as you put so much work into everything.
my name is bronya rand, heir to belobog's supreme guardian and acting commander of the silvermane apologies, i'm used to introducing myself like that -- you can call me bronya.
the vast majority are showing some loss of vitality, but nothing serious.
simple: you just gotta stand at the byline and give your team tactical instructions.
but sampo after all this time, what made you suddenly want to take back your mask? this doesn't seem like the sampo i know
my goodness! well, it sounds like they made quite a big catch.
there's no need to say that the beauty of music is its ability to resonate with people and stir up their imaginations.
be careful, benefactors. the disciples of sanctus medicus worship yaoshi the plagues author -- the greatest enemy of the xianzhou.
i was supposed to be a mediator, but uh i might've gotten a little too involved just now. anyway, one of those two should probably start talking.
exactly right. please consider your choice carefully. remember, you are representing the whole of mondstadt.
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
are you sure? this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. i'd urge you not to squander it.
though i should warn you, most people aren't exactly enamored with my conversation.
pom-pom looks really cute when they walk
yeah. it may sound harsh, but uncle tian is past his prime. he's not cut out for this anymore.
that was to be expected, of course. the guilty can never produce proof of their innocence.
in short, spices supreme will release a series of crossover meal deals. customers get aurum alley shopping coupons when they place an order.
i came here to listen to your explanation. but i never imagined that, besides being good at preaching, you'd also have quite a few tricks up your sleeve.
no thanks, mister afshin. you can't use that kind of tactic on her. look, you've already sucked her in.
exactly. that's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
it's fine, mister skott. if you really don't want your cargo to be inspected, it doesn't matter.
hah, that guy. one of these days he's gonna get busted by my brother.
hurry, chapter two, let's go. can't you see that satomi is waiting?
i had my secretary do some analysis. the current price of luminescent spines far exceeds the profits that could be made on the end product.
yes looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
she looks so young. she was already famous in the last amber era, no? she has to be at least a hundred years old.
i'm sorry, i invited you to come and watch the fireworks, but now i have to run a few errands.
the moment i used magic, i sensed something strange down there. i have a feeling it's connected to why the tavern had to close down.
i have to applaud the great magician for the level of professionalism he displays in his craft. if i ever have the time, i would very much like to enjoy one of his shows as a regular audience member.
i remember when old mettle and i first met, we weren't very accepting of each other he said i had a bad temper, and i thought he was ugly.
as an observer, i get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
march, it's me, yunli. are you okay?
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
its aroma is just so wonderfully delicious! if you ever see kids crowding all around mister jut's place, you'd know he's baking up a storm.
yeah, i guess so i still feel like my audience will see them as ghosts, to be honest.
(the king does not appear entirely aware of his surroundings. the man by his side, though we should keep a close eye on him.)
that object was pretty important to you, right?
i'd be partial to some shortbread.
it was a deliberate display to showcase the dangerous nature of the "cargo" in broad daylight. this way, the cargo would end up in the shackling prison, serving as a tool for the prison break.
i also have something i wish to discuss with the merchant guild, but i'll wait for you to finish.
let's go then. we need to find something, even if we have to search every corner of this market.
i'm sorry it took so long for me to find it. only by bringing it to you will my nightmares be calmed.
why don't i watch the store? as it happens, i know a thing or two about perfume.
yes indeed. and they are some of my most reliable helpers and friends.
but when there are valid grounds, i will not only judge travelers from abroad
oh? mister dongsheng, i'd like to hear a little more about this "dirty laundry." would you care to elaborate?
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
you probably imagine that mingxing jewelry deals exclusively in expensive luxury goods.
i take back what i said. we have to hurry to that memory zone where miss firefly's presence was imprinted. considering what this person can do
well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that i am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
why do i wield my sword? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
the sole reason i held this auction is to reclaim my treasured possessions.
the original mikawa flower festival was much more lively. but even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
hahaha, curious we've only just met, and you've already given me three causes for vengeance. it's been a while since i've encountered anyone as interesting as you.
well then, i will take care of the cirrus situation. as for what gets written in the luofu's ghostly grove, i'll leave that up to you.
hehe, don't worry. i'm always happy to help a junior colleague from yuehai pavilion.
come on. we'll need to get the go-ahead from neuvillette aeur" i know just where to find him.
i see so mavuika has asked you to forge an ancient name for an outlander. that certainly would be an unprecedented feat.
perhaps your skills have regressed due to lack of use, but, soon, the unpleasant smell of something burnt fills the air.
well, the paths here serve as both passageways for the ten-lords commission and barriers for the prisoners.
ah! yes, yes, -- snowman's palm! ugh, my memory is the worst.
hehe, giving a dramatic speech to my boss was cool and everything, but it's not gonna help her break free from the heliobus clouding her mind.
getting close means losing friend after friend for hundreds of years until the weight of their memories crushes my soul.
well, it looks like everything's finally in order. i suppose it's time to head back?
ahem on behalf of the sky-faring commission, i would like to thank the crew of the express for saving the luofu from the stellaron crisis.
n--no need, bronya! you're a supreme guardian now. don't let a little thing like this
i believe everyone here is familiar with the general contents of the proposal. after this round of financing, the ipc is expected to hold thirty% of penacony's shares.
come join us over here! let's share some great food and drinks, and chat about all sorts of fun things.
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
however, everyone in the cosmos knows of the stellaron hunters' reputation. so, why did you place so much trust in them? could it be that some of you have a connection with them?
i used to think just like that samurai that i was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
the eremites have been struggling to make ends meet recently, so a lot of groups have been doing "private" work that involves the rich.
as you venture further into the city, the streets appear largely empty. an elderly woman walks past. you see her shake her head as she puts away her wrinkled wallet.
i'll take this weapon since it used to belong to este. maybe it'll find comfort in being held by someone who appreciates the arts.
i cannot. in my current state, even if i went out, i could do nothing.
when i first arrived in liyue harbor, i passed by a large house, and felt a chill go down my spine. so i made a rattan figure, and gave it to the young master there.
"authorized personnel only. this chamber is sac" how do you pronounce it?
if a vision is a gift from the gods
there's no mistaking it this component was taken from gears and wisdom!
hmm, that's actually not a bad idea. let's go and ask him.
no, it's fine. let them sit for a while.
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
with the technique my cousin explained, i managed to connect several of these rattan figures to the gate array. that way, the fetor blast will be shared evenly by everyone in the array.
ahem! well, to be precise, we had dispatched two additional squads here in order to prevent the suspect from escaping.
and aren't human emotions aeur" love, hate, regret, and hope aeur" just the most mesmerizing things in this world?
unfortunately for them, i'm one of the best trackers in the business. they're not about to get away with their little scheme on my watch.
it's okay. i promised you i'd help find your grandpa, so i'll do whatever it takes.
if i am not mistaken, what we just saw was a samurai's memory that was buried in the land.
by the way, dunyarzad, we've already started decorating the grand bazaar. it looks spectacular, thanks to your generous contribution!
it's truly reassuring to have such outstanding members among our ranks.
sorry, but even a general needs to pay their bills. we don't do credit here. and let's not forget, you'd have been waiting decades for a chance to see the dragon lady if it weren't for me.
she went toe-to-toe with the general's star pupil! i'd be pretty pleased with myself, too.
it's nothing forget i said anything.
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
the sun feels almost as hot as those studio lights i'm in front of all the time good thing there can only be one sun.
i'm heartbroken i thought it might take you a little longer than this to forget all about me?
um we don't really know a whole lot about wineware let's just go with zhiyi's choice. would you be able to show us the one he bought?
i mean, carrying around the sword like that would be pretty conspicuous. wouldn't a thief prefer to take the case as well?
sounds like there really was something on her mind.
i didn't expect him to be willing to go through so much pain just to deny us some intel.
you're welcome! well then fare thee well, master dugu.
so the master was not likely an innocent victim in all of this?
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
most people in a frenzy don't stop to ponder the details.
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
a planet covered in snow and ice will i find my answer here?
you're miss seele from wildfire? i came here to
this crate looks promising. maybe there are spare stove components inside
yes, and once we're done, we will find a merchant to give us an appraisal of their value.
she spends all her time alone. having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
"that ningguang," they thought "she must be up to something. we can't let her get away with it"
oh? are you putting me to the test? challenge accepted.
hehe, thank you both kindly.
got it! it's definitely sturdier now nice job, lynxy!
wait, you're not leaving?
it'll give you a chance to figure out her moves in advance and come up with a counter strategy. that should be a big help, don't you think?
we're not to use our status or reputation in liyue harbor to our advantage, and we have no starting capital.
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate
we should be able to see the stars tonight.
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
do make the most of your trip here, won't you? quite a lot has changed.
have you talked to oleg about going to see svarog?
besides, if i'd waited until my brothers were finished trying to out-polite each other, the food would've gone cold.
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
three thousand, seven hundred years according to our records, the adepti signed a contract with rex lapis to protect liyue three thousand, seven hundred years ago.
still remember what i taught you? feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then get close to it.
please keep everything i'm about to say to yourselves. no one else can know. otherwise
it was me who accepted the bet. you're not involved at all
if it'll make you feel better i can avert my gaze.
that won't do. even a survey requires rigorous methodology, let alone an investigation.
if you have a target in mind, let's go investigate.
in all of belobog, you won't find anyone who speaks more elegantly or acts more like a leader than lady bronya.
shouldn't you gather people's opinions first?
i vow to take down a lord ravager and teach the ruin legion the true meaning of the hunt.
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
you know, it was difficult for me to believe you. some of the words you use are too alien for those that have lived their entire life in belobog.
despite this, they were all willing to pay very dearly for them. i wonder is faith in me really the only factor in their appraisal of the items' value?
when we were at mingxing jewelry, i admitted that my decision to sacrifice the jade chamber was a calculated one. i had already considered what i stood to lose and to gain.
mm, my thoughts exactly. but we need to be discreet. if they realize we're onto them, then we will lose the element of surprise.
i don't know how to offer words of comfort, nor do i know much about curing others' ailments.
oh, right! if you're gonna go find lynxy, you gotta know what she looks like!
well, defeating the dragon and the monsters should be straightforward enough but how do we fix the magic?
someone's not in the best of moods let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
there you are! come on, let's go to the ceremony together!
sorry to interrupt. we're actually members of the, uh liyue anglers association, and we just wanted to ask a few questions about someone.
vilmant? the one who's playing the role of the villain?
throwing all of sumeru into chaos is the only way to change the way of life here in the desert. anyway, that's my guess why they've chosen to become radicals.
breakfast also isn't usually so lavish. hence my surprise when we got here.
looking carefully, that indeed appears to be the case.
yeah ahem, i mean, not too much, actually.
hehe, that sounds great. i'm looking forward to it.
he was the one who proposed doing this aeur" he even wants to assist in our magic shows.
i gotta admit, i had a lot of misunderstandings about the silvermane guards. they're fighting for survival here every day, just like wildfire.
well, life and death, jiaoqiu, it's all predetermined.
that might sound silly to you like, why do you have to be happy just because it is?
yes. the truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, baal and beelzebul.
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
make sure you listen to grandpa almond, padisarah. don't go running off on your own!
no need to apologize -- feel free to read it. if you're interested in the incomplete ones you can take it.
gifts must have an element of surprise -- just treat it as a part of life!
if elder huaiyan accepts the explanation, so do i.
a while indeed. as you can see, lisa and i are on duty.
during the festival, most of the yae publishing house's editors will be staying near the outlander affairs agency. if you run into any problems, you may find them there.
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
i'm not talking about the puppet. i mean her. you've met her, yes?
no, not at all. we use it for surgeries in the alchemy commission, so what kind of side effects could it possibly have? it's just
i knew exactly what he was doing. and, yeah, if i ever did share my memories with someone, i guess that person would be a friend. but, it never got to that point.
that's right. although there were a few hiccups here and there, the sabzeruz festival turned out to be a grand success!
i can't even tell if it's ingenium or biological in nature.
if it's that mysterious could you let me take a look, so i can better understand its mysteriousness?
i see i'm glad they're all safe and sound. i can try to use my magic to fold a boat to bring everyone back.
if the opportunity arises, i would like to take you diving with me.
combine the adepti sigils with the wonder cores and insert them into the jade chamber's control compartment.
hehe, i i'm afraid i can't. i won't be flying anymore.
"father" has her ways many of them are beyond our imagination, and we've never had the chance to see her at work. but we trust her conclusions.
i like fireworks because creating incredible fireworks makes me feel so proud of my work.
then, as a champion duelist, i hereby accept your request for a duel, and extend to you my most sincere regards.
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
i doubt he came here to learn. he's much too old to start getting a basic education now, and from what i know of him, i doubt he has any interest in intellectual pursuits.
rest assured, i am not prone to misjudgment.
the true "death" where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
a box in a box, that's how you know the gift is sincere!
the assessment process comes to an end here, uncle tian. in my opinion, zhiyi is not suitable for the position. but qianwei and mingbo both have potential.
with what power belobog currently holds, we are far from being able to assist the nameless however, i do hope that one day we can provide you with reliable support.
only the best! and i've learned a lot, too!
did the medicine have any side effects for you?
but if we were to change the siblings to two sisters of a similar age then that aspect of the story might come through more clearly.
i'm just a little confused you mentioned that the water droplet showed you how to use the projector?
i had no idea you knew how to bake i thought you'd be the type who'd never get anywhere near the kitchen.
if there's nothing else i can do for the both of you, i'll be on my way.
i've read "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." it has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
i still hadn't really met many children my age at that time, so i didn't know how to interact with others.
reserved? really?
come, let's take a look around the contestant hall.
if you don't come to sumeru city often, classic floral designs aren't a bad choice. those don't really go out of style.
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
you mean you also want to discuss something important with me?
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
even so, himeko indicated that the source of stellarons remains mysterious, and there are no realistic ways to remove a stellaron's contamination.
i look forward to experiencing it with you all.
nope, but you just reminded me, giovanni wanted me to pass on a message to you both:
i'm just a little curious. isn't it really tiring for miss sparkle to play so many different roles?
that said, since i'm free to come and go as i please here, it would be a terrible waste for me to not use it as a backup base.
yeah, i had someone deliver letters to all of our guests, but maybe everyone is still busy with other things.
don't be afraid. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall is of great help to the garden.
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
got it, the encryption key! quick, before we attract attention, let's--
heaven and earth, rain and wind, the endless sky and the boundless land. forest boars and ocean shrimp, lavender melons and matsutake 'shrooms!
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
i don't think so no one should be living here. i never saw anyone when i came here to hunt for supplies.
even though the filming process proved to be extremely challenging, everyone provided valuable and unique contributions to the final product. thank you all for your dedication and support!
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
do you two want to come? it'll be a really fun time!
it's alright, my lady. that's pretty common in mercenary circles. didn't i mention that my father was chasing after women? i was the result of one of those encounters with some random person.
haha i was just joking. i've been waiting for you.
heh, i'm just pulling your leg. she let me try some of her tea already, and we had a lovely chat.
hmm so should we also take those skills, then?
there is something else he cares more about and needs -- or should i say, is verifying.
card games these days are rather ingenious.
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
yes, the story is the reason i agreed to join. i can't bear to even imagine what this film would look like without the very best director.
the training is much to her signature style i hope it won't make it seem like she is too unaware of the abilities of others.
if it can deepen your understanding of our trials and tribulations, it will have fulfilled its purpose.
on top of that, in order to increase player immersion, the club has created some of the story's sets and scenes in real life. we'll only know where we should go once the script manager reveals the starting location.
the emotionless, soulless, and merciless evil ninja osaru.
but if i just marched straight in there by myself, i'd probably get miss kamisato in a whole heap of trouble, hehe
traveler, make sure you take a little time to enjoy yourself, too.
my decision to destroy the jade chamber was nowhere near as thought-through as i made it out to be. i just thought we should do what needed to be done, and this was a decision that only i could make.
i appreciate your concerns. i will consider the options carefully and be sure to proceed appropriately.
this is the other solution -- the alternative choice. i created a new solution.
oh? am i really so terrifying? well then, i'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up
sorry, i don't mean to sound so formal. once you reach my age, it's difficult to make new friends
fine, i'm just spitballing here. don't take it so seriously
bernard claims to have received a letter last night from pierre. in the letter, pierre stated that he had gone into hiding. is there something wrong with the letter?
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
"the marechaussee hunter says nothing in response to that question."
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
fulfill this pact between us, and you can expect your journey on amphoreus to be free of troubles.
the puppet, yes. i've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
as long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
still doubting what your heart tells you, haniyyah?
there are so many silvermane guards on patrol. is it usually like this?
i know. they always think they can push through the pain.
we can't let that happen, though. not only would everyone involved in the theater go hungry, but then we wouldn't be able to hold the sabzeruz festival anymore.
plus, a long-standing member has recently returned to our ranks after a long absence. i thought it would be fitting to celebrate the occasion.
oh please, do your worst~ i never asked souka to win in the first place. besides, maybe suffering a humiliating defeat will give her the epiphany she so desperately needs.
the coffee is strong and rich with just a nice hint of bitterness to it.
miss topaz, you mentioned accountability
some words are not to be passed on.
why does luka always come sneaking back into town like this?
as you can see, we're working on a construction project.
something that mom isn't supposed to know?
you collect the treasure and make your way back to the capital with your bag of loot in hand.
we're just having a walk. neither of us could sleep. you can rescind your baseless accusations.
left, to the end of the corridor. i will wait there for you.
the matter has finally come to an end, but we mustn't lower our guard. increase patrols around qingce village and coordinate our people at other fireworks locations to prevent any further theft.
maybe she was just in awe of the director's aura?
and that's not all deep down, i've always been looking forward to the day i could wear something different from what i normally do.
as much as i'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, i suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
that's not true, guyun. that nameless swordmaster shaped his own destiny, so you can too.
but i've made up my mind. so i will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
i'm not trying to scare you -- i'm simply suggesting you ask the craftsmen to see if they can provide an insider like qingque to guide you.
all joking aside, i'm glad you're here. let's get moving and take care of this as soon as possible.
i already have a long list of vengeance to exact. even if i wanted to begin now, i'd have to start in the right order.
okay, here we go
hehe, what an adorable little girl. well, that settles it. aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
and so, the theater wants to host a celebration event.
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
talanton surrendered their coreflame, though the chrysos heir taking over their legacy is nowhere to be found today.
but don't worry aeur" if you run into any trouble, i'll be there faster than you can say "gold-level courier of the komaniya express"!
by true-to-life, you mean the director's sudden disappearance?
this isn't the overworld. we don't do envy and etiquette down here. whatever's on your mind, you can say it.
so everything here was built according to your designs? i did not know you possessed such abilities.
not a smart way to operate. the luofu is more dangerous than ever -- i can't let you put yourself in harm's way.
the bandits were eventually brought to justice. but the fear and trauma remained in the villagers' hearts.
as a passing traveler here, it's not my place to comment on their disputes
it's my duty to stop intruders from breaking into important places. if telling the truth sounds rude, then i'm afraid you're just a little too fragile.
then allow me! as a streamer, i've done my fair share of research. let me find my script
every day, i try to figure out how to repair some of them and return the robots to normal. except there are a lot more than mister svarog and i can handle on our own.
building a better world for future generations sound great, right? but is it any fun for the engineers and architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
i figured we would come check out the situation either way. why not let her keep some privacy.
you have earned a second chance with your honesty.
good morning. i'm going for coffee shortly, would you like to join me? i brought coffee cups aeur" you can borrow one if you need.
it's been lit for so long now that the incense is running out. i'll leave refilling and lighting the incense to the most distinguished guest among us all.
eventually, you get used to the unpleasant odor of straw, mold, and rust, and find yourselves alternating between fits of drowsiness and despair
count me in. i'm sure miss qingque has something up her sleeve.
i will protect you. once i gather more information from him, i'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
but yes, you can count on us! we wouldn't let you miss out on all the fun.
uh, probably? but don't sweat it. we've already finished renovating the stage! come on, i'll show you.
is this a notebook?
it's been more than two hundred years i never thought i'd hear that name again.
young man, if you wish to apprehend someone, shouldn't you have a reason?
that is a possibility.
that there once existed a childish and foolish jerk with a heart of gold.
hahaha, i was fishing around on your behalf through the channels that aren't accessible to you. unfortunately, i didn't find any leads worth pursuing either.
i still don't wish to pretend to be someone else, but i do have a desire to express myself so maybe the show will go on for me after all.
hmph, i only took you there to demonstrate how tense things are. somehow we only tested the waters but ended up with the catch of the day.
nothing serious, really. we've just received a lot of reports in the past few days over things like line-cutting, reselling goods at inflated prices
yeah, and even if someone gets their hands on such a precious sword, it'll probably end up in someone else's.
it is by the will of the gods that you stood on okhema's side in the end.
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
there's clearly something special about qiqi. if i'd absorbed that much fetor, i don't think i'd still be around to tell the tale
in some ways, i believe he is similar to mister svarog. i can't overlook this unique quality
one thing will never change, though. we'll always have the memories we made together during this time.
you may be a ray of hope that fell onto amphoreus. however, until all has been proven, you cannot be allowed to pose a threat to amphoreus.
sumeru is run by wise and mighty sages. to them, us desert-dwellers are nothing but tools that can be used and discarded at their whim.
i have other business to attend to now, otherwise i would gladly escort you to the site in person. when you do arrive, please seek out my secretary.
you mean morax? it's been a while since i last saw him. a surprising decision by liyue's archon what a fascinating god he is.
hearing you say that, a glimmer of hope flashes in his eyes. but, it disappears almost as quickly as it came.
one more thing, don't forget to seal the heliobi within the evil binding matrix.
wait, so everyone found out that i?
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
it feels like we're just dancing to the heliobus's tune
now i just need to take some time to give this proposal some polish
but, given that the array gets its power from the ley lines, she suspects that the obfuscation requirement may be a rule laid down by the mountains and the land.
neither good nor bad. there you go.
how impressive! that's quite a fancy way of saying "i haven't learned anything so far."
"everywhere they go, they meet someone who's heard of him." hmm c'mon, let's keep asking around.
heh, we couldn't do anything to 'em inside their coop, but outside the akademiya this is our hunting ground.
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there)
is chevreuse still not joining us today?
oh, and the perfume sold around here is a lot better than what you'll find elsewhere. the fragrances are longer-lasting, and they're gentler on your skin
the moment he awoke, he was met with a familiar flavor in the chili-mince cornbread buns he ate
sure. there's no harm in changing my schedule around once in a while.
it looks like this gate has a more complicated structure than the last one
as long as bailu is in the pictures, we should be fine.
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
it's hard not to get a little irked thinking about it.
the answer is... when they are in desperate situations.
anyway vengeance will be mine.
i'm sure you must find it quite odd that all these everyday items could fetch such a huge price at auction.
did you understand a single word i just said? or do i need to bash your skull in some more?
oh? well if you're quite sure, then of course. now, i shall send you on your way.
everything you said earlier sounded like the truth. luckily, your monologue was dramatic enough to convince my friends you were just roleplaying.
enough about sampo! we need him for this trip, and we can still get rid of him after we reach the surface.
in which case, we don't need to change tactics, just change who we're following.
idyia is working on repairing the domain. we were just with her before coming here.
i'm happy to help, too. this is a beautiful city, and just like the forest of blessings, i would love to see it return to normal as soon as possible.
klee ran off excitedly as soon as we arrived. i'm a little worried about her, but albedo insisted he would look after her while we do our own thing.
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
if i may ask, what else has this alleged "card snatcher" suspected of doing?
oh no, we were supposed to chat together, but i've been doing all the talking
anyway. more importantly right now, the fireworks show is right around the corner and the materials still haven't arrived. we need to think of an alternative
"it is believed that takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the souran isshin art, tominaga masanari."
cirrus the only one who may have knowledge of tail's whereabouts is cirrus whose plans were foiled due to tail's actions.
that you will. and make sure not to steal my targets next time!
oh, right! so there's a line going there too?
a persons's footfall reveals a lot about their strength and emotions -- much like how a person's breath may serve as an indication of their overall health.
i'd hesitate to call it that. shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom -- many people lost their lives trying to catch a tiny morsel of meat for dinner.
hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. you can most definitely afford it they're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. you have quite the generous payment due.
not a problem, i was thinking the same thing! but i'm afraid telling you might not be enough.
ah, how wonderful. everyone's keeping their promises today.
some of the gods got drunk. one started playing music and the greater lord started singing, so the goddess of flowers began to dance.
i understand. i'm counting on you!
i told him that it was best not to speak too soon aeur" there's no guarantee that wriothesley will make a personal appearance.
but in her own life, her greatest desire wasn't to be the center of attention i can tell how much she loved you all, and how much she loved the troupe.
mechanics, research, and music are all things i'm pretty good at, wouldn't you say? but i guess making money's not on the list
nobody knows why svarog did any of this he usually doesn't leave the furnace core and interfere unless some kind of disorder breaks out in the underworld.
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
garden of recollection is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
hmm, what sauce should i pick for my macaroni tonight?
as a mark of my gratitude, i will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
hehe i assume you're hoping to take back a few moves.
nowadays mengming manages everything in and out of the tea house. people say "foxians are born to do business," but things are always easier said than done.
very well. come with me, we'll choose some bystanders to converse with.
he's like a furnace, always lit with bottomless fire. this fire will either completely be doused in a storm, or melt down his own existence with it.
and in fact, what meng has said is entirely plausible. spirits, on occasion, do find a way into our world.
so close and yet so far you'll have to pick up the pace.
(i think she's enjoying herself)
could you repeat what you just said, yanqing?
mister hirayama, the tenryou commission will continue by investigating the warehouse staff. if you come across any further clues, please notify us immediately.
huh... there's something strange about that sofa.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
wanmin restaurant's business has been booming recently, so with chef mao being swamped with customers, and xiangling still often out in search of new recipes, i introduced shenhe to staff the restaurant.
as a fellow arbiter-general, i fully understand the difficulties of this position.
if shorter wavelengths could be observed, it'd make for a good thesis... but that's not the focus of today.
ah, you're back. from the sound of your stride, i sense you're in good spirits.
good work, everyone! we're looking to wrap with our two main ladies today. i can already smell our success, hehe!
if you have the chance, don't forget to come and visit the xianzhou zhuming!
momentum alone will only keep you going for about three days. if you really want to stick with it, you need a solid plan.
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
looks like they're not going to show up here. i'll just head straight to the artisanship commission.
what an interesting way to mark the start of your journey. i grow more and more curious about your cause.
a little while ago, i took some time to survey every inch of this place.
that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name
great, well, now satomi can get started on that.
oh? but that might take some time. besides, we're not here to get to know each other as family.
don't worry! madam yukong is kind-hearted too. come on now, i'll lead the way.
seele has been like this since she was little -- impulsive and eager to be the best. for people who don't know her, they might find her difficult
i found out from other sources that the harbinger "regrator" got involved.
i said look at me. take a good hard look. sense anything strange?
so, one of my answers will be true, the other will be false. as for which is which, that's up to the asker to make the call
"miss serval" clara is such a well-mannered kid! meanwhile, the architects' children are still calling me "auntie" and making me feel old
nevertheless, i do have a few matters i should like to entrust to you here today.
as long as i'm not busy, you're welcome any time!
many gods used to walk this earth, and many long wars were fought between them that did not abate until two thousand years ago. much blood was shed, and many lives were lost.
despite all the hardships elder huaiyan has faced, he still finds joy in the world. he is an example every general should follow.
doesn't look like there are any more clues. let's head back to the crime scene.
i was only joking, hook. junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. but you must make one promise to me
a meticulously choreographed "chance meeting" sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
still, if we're going to hunt the monsters, we need to know where to find them. can you give us any leads?
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
my master and general jing yuan have an unpleasant history with each other. but personal grudges are a luxury that adults cannot afford!
next time you try to bluff like that, at least make it convincing.
your flying sword? oh, so that's why i found a dagger in my bag. turns out it's yours.
i feel like i'm lying down on the back of a massive anemo slime. ahh, it's so light and comfy~
as for you, you must be the guests from the astral express, right? saving the luofu from that crisis, it's so impressive.
this is an aranara carving i bought in port ormos. i heard it's very popular with kids, so here, have one.
it is, isn't it? who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
in my role as champion duelist, my opinions do not matter. for when i draw my blade, i am but an instrument of fontaine's law.
in which case i shall call upon outrider amber to track it down
if you feel it's necessary, we'll do what mister svarog suggested but until you're sure, i'll keep trying to find a way to save pascal's emotions and memories
and of course, since you're putting this on your body, you need to consider the type of fabric the clothes are made from. some materials might look stunning, but they can be terribly uncomfortable to wear
may your spring of wondrous magic never run dry, and may all who call you their home lead happy, fulfilling lives
let's meet again. what an interesting bunch you are.
clearly, everyone needs to take a step back for now, and reflect on what really matters. when emotions are running high, things get lost in the fray.
there's no better place for looking out into the stars than the express. i envy you guys.
the model in the sandpit... it's the golden hour, isn't it?
i thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant memokeeper might have left in your mind. now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.
you're right. i "took" it with my skills, so i guess you can say i'm a robber or something. how dare he imply i'm a thief. totally different!
since returning to the luofu, i've been buried in work. there are only three things that bring me joy: eating food, making perfumes, and teasing qingque.
it makes sense that there are many merchants who oppose the merchant guild and support the ipc.
you guys know ifa, right? no? well, he's a pretty famous vet around these parts. he's always bringing me all sorts of things, and he happens to be very good friends with ororon.
but i have experienced it all. that is why i have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
ahh, at long last we can finally be at ease now that we've nipped those problems in the bud.
then i'm glad. i shall save you the trouble of hearing what those people may say.
let's focus on igniting the braziers first.
mm an international rock 'n' roll music festival sounded like a good way to attract tourists. and it's to bring attention to the plight of living things, right? seems like a meaningful cause.
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
right, now let's go hunt down this harbinger
the next time we gather here, we must have a solid plan.
i've considered that possibility, but even still, i want to tell her what we've found. i think i owe her that much true friendship is built on trust.
ugh let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
the moment news spreads about penacony going public, trillions of customers will immediately receive a message like this:
an abrupt ending to an epic that has barely begun might also amaze the people.
look, it's common sense and easy, right?
well, if it isn't franz, long time no see! you're still watching the entrance?
there's no need for that. this was merely a transaction.
while the nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
ridiculous! hoping to stop me with such cheap parlor tricks? not a chance!
lingsha told me there's tasty food in aurum alley, let's go there.
i mean we're somewhere called the forest of blessings, so it kind of makes sense.
norbert's position is indeed an idle one -- it's no wonder he has time to socialize with members of the limestein family.
hah the scenery out here is fine indeed, but the wind is a little strong. our preparations to receive guests within are complete aeur" so please, this way.
well hello there, little one. oh? i see you've brought a special guest.
the president commands the trust of many reputable shops in the alley. their support for him was likely to be a big obstacle to your rejuvenation project.
relaxing after work is actually pretty nice.
you flatter me, lady yuheng! my family are but distant relatives. we would hardly consider ourselves the true heirs to that illustrious lineage.
patience, phainon. do not make us question this decision.
fortunately, apart from the language module, pascal is still functioning properly
i think that this is beneficial to them.
heh, looks like your general hasn't told you to stop hopping around like a sparrow in a fight, huh?
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
don't imitate the memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! well
my father probably thought that people could settle into new lives as long as they moved to a new environment.
however, there are still other things we can do. let's keep going.
that outsider looks weak, but is pretty brave. if he weren't on the xianzhou and hadn't met me, he'd totally get robbed just for lugging such a huge case around.
he heard that the miners and vagrants had begun to engage in a large-scale conflict he wanted to stop everyone from getting hurt fighting over the mines.
there are still many guests arriving here. please be cautious!
all of you here are my distinguished guests. i am determined that each of you thoroughly enjoys yourself.
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
oh, here you are. swordmasters should greet each other with their swords. old mettle, say hi!
there are people within the alliance who also believe that the suspect is now on the yuque.
not that long ago but i've been receiving strict cloud knight military training since i was a child!
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge
me? oh, well, i bought some tea, of course. i just had to try all the varieties recommended in the steambird.
listen, you've never been labeled as a social pariah, have you?
put a watermelon parfait in herta's office and stephen is sure to show up. remember, the pumpkin ones will never attract him -- those are for warding him off.
i would save the jokes for later! as the saying goes, with great work comes great rewards. the ten-lords commission will compensate you accordingly.
this time around, there were no successful bids for him.
which is why i thought it would be more appropriate to ask you to introduce me first.
by that, you mean your life working as the akademiya's scribe?
no. every name on that tablet made the same choice. all hunters know what the path entails.
however, someone had already been on the scene before we arrived.
this is one aspect of the truth that i can share only with you.
should i take your words to mean that these documents were not forgeries? they were really penned by your own hand?
well, that's not up to me dig in. i called you here so you could enjoy the food.
i must say, this is most intriguing
you want to stay here? no, no, the artisanship commission isn't safe enough. how about this -- i'll escort you and mister luocha a little further.
look, we are joined together now.
nor do i think it is any great shame. there is no lack of fine actors or inspirational stories, either on or off the stage.
don't forget to rest! you guys have got a busy day ahead of you!
i never knew the grand strategist of watatsumi island was a skilled negotiator as well as a formidable commander.
for once, i don't need to work overtime at night huh what a strange feeling
the "replica personality module" is off. that can't be. this parameter is set to be enabled by default.
but computers with too high a computing capability tend to attract computing stings like them. no one knows how these creatures evolved from their progenitor aeur" the propagation.
maybe igor even attended the wardance. the xianzhou people have long lives, so it wouldn't be something that happened long ago for them.
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
well, never mind. what about one of you, then? anyone who can defeat me, takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new tenryou commissioner.
mm that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
it seems that's everything we now know one of the culprit's physical traits and that he is extremely violent. but how can we track him down?
yes, i did. but you must know, in the lawrence family, "dear friend" is a set phrase that can only be used towards certain friends with whom one is acquainted, but not particularly close.
of course, being a spectator is the easiest. lil gui's up there in the stands right now, watching us duke it out from her vantage point. she's such a baddie.
everything should be fine as long as that oni manages to avoid causing a scene.
go and talk to these people. they're all customers of my pawnshop. see for yourself if their wishes have come true.
i sincerely apologize, but i cannot approve knight klee's request for time off.
sure. coincidentally, i have something to do here as well. seems chance has brought us all together.
i see but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
we should make some tea, too. sipping tea, chatting, and just enjoying the time off, it's a great way to recharge.
i've already informed the police station. there'll be someone to take you into the warehouse, so you may head there directly.
but don't think we'll just hand over the mastery mark without a fight -- you'd better make sure you're ready before you even think about challenging us!
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
sorry to ask you like this after having just met, but your answer is very important to us.
that's right. dreams themselves may be imaginary, but they're also experiences that can never be relived or replicated.
i should draft a report about this experience.
i figured that as uncle tian's daughter, you'd naturally grasp your father's strategies.
i'm planning to make a new set with the board and pieces based on the battle for liyue.
he must be a fan of this book too i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
didn't hear me, did you? with those petty tricks of yours do you actually think you can slip away right under my nose?
the actions and desires of the nameless are always sincere. when dealing with you, the same sincerity is the most fitting price.
that makes sense to me monsieur neuvillette, i would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
even though you couldn't see it through to the final scene, the audience was very impressed by your performance. it's safe to say that you made your mark on this memorial show.
d--don't worry lynxy! i'm sure you'll get concrete proof one day
i think we've narrowed it down a little further.
*sigh* spare me. beautiful eyes though -- are you from sigonia?
as for the trade issues we raised, i will discuss options with the yashiro commission and make sure both sides have ample participation in the final arrangement
precisely. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
i won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
i--it's nothing. you're right, it does belong to me.
i see. well, thank you for sharing that with us.
ah, chiori! you sure have changed a lot. this is the first time we've seen you since you left inazuma.
this is life and death, okay!? you look like you can handle yourself, how come you're so lazy?
so, you seem to be under the impression that i am able to offer some sort of help? who gave you that idea?
you may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the yaoqing's warriors.
by that, you mean
so, you relied on this rhetoric to manipulate the ignorant members of the vidyadhara into serving you?
everyone, i'd like to introduce you to our newest member: inayah!
no, only a handful. after all, i prefer warm memories baked in sunshine. they're the ones that usually belong to kind people.
this jade abacus is too severely damaged. even with my best efforts, i can only restore a small part of the record.
then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? as for the debt we'll find a way to gradually repay it, but it'll take some time
may the best swordmaster win.
if anything else is unclear, you can ask baishi.
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
never mind. i know i can't talk you out of a mindset that's been built up over a lifetime.
your opponent this time is similar to the ipc mechs. unsheathe your swords and give it everything you've got!
i'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
there were so many paths here, and they're all twisty-turny and up and down it's hard navigating through them all.
let's just have a casual conversation. it's easiest that way.
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy it must mean we're doing something right.
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
anyway, i guess i should be thanking you. i haven't seen miss dunyarzad that happy in a long time. if wasn't for you two, she probably would've been caught and dragged back much earlier.
even though she will one day seize your vision, too?
today i just realized i misheard her. i think she actually said: "the edge may break, but the heart remains" probably.
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
that's okay. this one is not for profit.
how do you ipc cronies have the audacity to fight cloud knights? you practically assaulted law enforcement officers.
take your time. enjoy the meal and calm yourself.
what did you tell her?
why wouldn't i? you've gotta be self-reliant down here. watch, you might learn something.
it's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. you can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful ei
hm, even when you put it that way, it still doesn't feel right
please don't worry, mister dan heng. if someone must be held accountable, it won't fall solely on your shoulders.
i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
alright then. let me get this straight. you're telling me that my body's already gotten used to this greatsword, but my brain just doesn't remember it?
and now, i propose a toast
this area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. i guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
hah, then it's mere flattery you pick your moments to wisecrack, don't you? now i don't know whether to take what you said earlier seriously
hmm well, the origami animals in the forest only drink magic tonic what do the toy people here in constellation metropole eat?
oh, really? but i just heard pom-pom say that she sometimes sleeps in until noon.
zhiyi? well, obviously, as the most promising candidate, we will be investigating him ourselves.
anyway, as long as you're all right. i should return to my room too.
that's not a problem. i'll adjust the pace based on the actual number of players and ensure that everyone has a good time.
a long time ago, with the approval of the qixing, a mining team conducted an exploratory excavation there.
nothing looks out of place, and everything's spaced out just right.
hmm, now that i think about it, her opponent in the finals will be a tough one to beat.
ahem! he is family, after all anyway, i will make sure to find him and escort him safely back to mondstadt.
signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." for most of the residents here, especially those in the underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
the specifics, however, will require further investigation. this will take some time
take a walk with me. i have things to share with you.
it can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
i leave the matters of the ghost-hunting squad in your hands. if you have further questions, just ask huohuo.
to begin with, let's set him to scent detection mode~
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
your performance tonight will almost certainly attract their attention.
you weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you?
you know, ei never said goodbye to me before she stepped into the plane of euthymia.
hmm, this bronya is really different from the bronya i remember.
this whole thing is making me pretty nervous, actually it's like i've been pushed on stage without being taught the choreography!
haha, the little babies from the luofu just don't have the resilience that us kids from the zhuming have!
normally, any reasonable merc will know to keep their distance when they see another group's banner.
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
who knows? the akasha can put knowledge into our heads, so who's to say that it can't also poke around in there? we don't know any specifics.
still, i hope you can avoid danger this time around. an uneventful trip might be a nice change of pace.
so when i say this "curse" is just a figment of the imagination, i say it with more certainty than most. but i also can't really go telling people that the ancient plagues were real, or it would incite panic.
huh who's wilder? and what's "aetherium wars"?
but if it turns out that you have been deceptive in this matter, then not only will you be arrested immediately, but you'll also be charged with one more crime. do i make myself clear?
oh, speaking of cloud retainer, when did you see her last?
mister sunday has done some serious research on his suspects... this traitor must have been causing trouble for the family for a long time.
right. i'll leave the research to you then, lisa.
the paperwork will have to wait. i'm coming with you.
i don't quite understand what happened there, but congratulations, i think?
this conflict is inevitable it's destiny.
where are you where are you
i'm not sure. a complete reconciliation may also not be the best thing for them right now.
huh, i just found this in my pocket how did it get there?
the cryo god's fatui have always coveted the anemo god's power.
borisin infiltrated the prison in disguise and released the prisoners, spreading chaos.
i want to do something a little self-indulgent. is that okay by you?
after all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
hehe judging by the look on your face, i'm guessing you've fallen for the rumors about me being very wealthy and having high demands for my standards of living?
human life is short. enjoy it while it lasts.
well? feeling less worried now?
now then. the schedule. let's see what you have for me today.
hello. none of you seem surprised by my arrival.
cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, but the ninja belief in exorcising evil will never change.
alright, never mind. so how about what they said aeur" do you remember their exact words?
ahem please allow me to explain to our host.
oh? now that's interesting.
during our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by mister sunday
if you wanted to refuse, then why would you be standing here right now?
all three from the yaoqing are critically injured, but fortunately, the xianzhou luofu has a miraculous healer lady. it's a silver lining in this misfortune.
something i've begun to realize since my departure from the opera epiclese is that there's a lot you don't see when you observe everything from on high.
my ninja arts will only send the fiendlings out of this place. but fret not, i can freely use my ninja fist!
one day, this rage will ignite and burn me alive. i will become the very monster that the reignbow lux arrow hunts
unfortunately, we didn't achieve the outcome we wanted. but moments like this... make me feel like they never even left.
siltwater lakes usually appear farther inside the desert. according to some very tall tales, they're believed to be al-ahmar's blessings.
oh? is the chef from liyue? from liuli pavilion or xinyue kiosk, perhaps?
grandpa! give me that cursed sword right now! i'll melt away the remnants of that man's curse once and for all!
hmm, i've been on the express for a while but i still don't have any new songwriting inspiration. how strange
but their leader seems like a reasonable individual. oleg and i have our differences in understanding, but we respect each other's opinion.
and no guardians of liyue chess set would be complete without you, would it?
this is the grand narukami shrine, after all. ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the shogun herself
i am also one of the adepti. you can say that i'm an adeptus in training.
is this lady your friend too?
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
pets like that are pretty rare, but some of the folks who have them have formed a small community to share ideas. some are interested in nurturing robots. others force them into battle.
and given the looks of you two, i presume that you are here to celebrate the lantern rite?
hmm that wasn't quite what i'd call "by the book"
this isn't the first time they've come by. they had asked us several times in the past to improve the quality of our performances by only putting on shows they consider to be sufficiently intellectual.
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch
i have to leave for a moment and do some inspections around the ship. this was also part of grandpa's orders.
exactly! now do you believe that my content isn't clickbait?
with me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
is that really so hard? you've already written most of it. surely you can write an ending where the hunters win and justice prevails? i'll be there to help you, too.
when people want fireworks, it's always because they have something to commemorate. and if they miss the chance, they might never get another one. so, no matter how busy i am, i'm always happy to take their orders.
but we can leave that for later let's take care of the malfunctioning puppets first.
what about chiori and charlotte? i feel like both of them would be more than up to it.
is this something tail would do?
indeed, we need some time to digest such a wealth of information.
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
i see. the spatial ninjutsu that you displayed earlier was truly ingenious. i wouldn't be surprised if you were a memo ninja from the garden of zencollection.
yeah, just leave them to candace. don't worry, she's as tough as they come.
i am not without my doubts about the whole affair but watatsumi island is hardly affluent, and these supplies are a much-needed lifeline for us.
a chat? is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
if what wallace said is right, then norbert must have been missing for several days already. there must be someone who knows where he is.
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
is that a secret code or something?
the general may behave slovenly, but he has plans for all the affairs of the xianzhou.
yeah, miss huohuo has been trying to track down tail -- in addition to helping the squad, that is.
once he's recovered, it won't be long until i bring him right back.
shouldn't you end with some words of encouragement? you know, to fire us up now?
we must seal the entrance before the borisin fugitives get out.
true now that i think about it, cloud retainer would be quite capable of taking care of anything on her own there's no need to worry about her.
you have a very considerate partner. follow me, then.
that way, even if the front line were to collapse the fragmentum monsters wouldn't be able to make it to the other side.
concern? why would i be concerned for the safety of my arch-enemies?
according to the intelligence, the suspect has already started reselling the statues near the festival venue. but he is lying low, and operating very discreetly.
ah yes, rings a bell. so what? i had no reason not to teach them.
most people only pay attention to your tail, but those soft, pointy ears are really just as fascinating.
afterwards, why not sit down for a while in the jade chamber, or have a short stroll? rest is also an integral part of any journey.
it's just i haven't found enough clues yet. the thief is really tricky. they haven't left any traces in the dwelling
i was planning to go after i finish my work, but the work keeps piling up i ended up completely forgetting about it.
sounds good! all you need to do to get to fontaine is cross this stretch of desert and navigate some waterways. knowing you two, i'm sure it won't be anything you can't handle.
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
maybe i should take a moment to meet with march before the tournament starts?
the wheels are completely broken, but the connecting component should be pretty much okay. let's remove it.
but of course. we also heard that master dugu is a kind and virtuous swordsman who never turns away anyone who comes with questions.
yeah, creating dramatic value. isn't that what you're most obsessed with?
as for how many floors there are? well, not even us judges know for sure.
please come this way.
if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
are you familiar with perfumery? making perfumes is just like dealing with people -- only when the top, middle, and base notes are in perfect harmony can one create a good fragrance.
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
i don't know what scheme northland bank has in the works, and i don't know what they're paying you.
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
i've also arranged your accommodation. simply follow the instructions in the letter when you're back in the city.
anyway, i lent out one of her manuscripts as a resource reference not long ago. it should still be in the master control zone. you can take a look if you wish.
the stairs were nothing! a little while ago, we discovered that the tree above the stage had a huge chunk of bark ready to fall off. mister zubayr was worried sick!
ahem! we've been eating the same rations for the entire trip, so i simply thought it was high time we had ourselves a proper meal. do you have a problem with that?
here, take this, little guest. this gift has been specially prepared for you by the family.
in the golden era you described, the old aurum alley had a trading volume similar to today.
(dehya and candace are both pretty tall. that means they have a lot of options when it comes to clothes)
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
i do, blade is in a prickly situation. on the xianzhou you're the only one i can turn to.
aaeur"a butterfly? was it on my head?
don't take any of what i just said seriously! how could i possibly let fontaine fall to the whims of trivial prophecy?
let's go to mingxing jewelry first, i need to pick up something before meeting them.
why are the bad guys always using good swords why can't the bad guys take bad swords?
and by the way, the ministry has requested the millelith to increase security along travel routes. how is that proceeding?
what are you up to? i only just convinced her everything's fine, you know
that doesn't mean i won't be making any changes to my life, though. as an example, i'm now thinking about taking on some small, odd jobs.
mingbo is reliable, but not quite ambitious enough, and because of his personality, he struggles to win people over.
well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
alright, i'll wait for you here. make it quick, though. i can tell you some other stories when you return.
greetings, friends. it's been a while.
huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
it is certainly unusual for us to meet in a place like this, but as lisa said, i'm glad to see you.
how did the conversation get so heavy again!? no good -- let's talk about something interesting.
it was good of mika to bring the letter back all this way. knowing that everyone is safe and sound is the best encouragement i could ask for.
trying to change mister svarog's mind on my own would take forever. even if i kept trying until i was all grown up, i don't think i could do it.
compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and grants knowledge to the people wait
huh, mister assistant detective? you seem to be getting anxious?
it seems our every meeting is accompanied by an incident of some sort. i hope i can meet the astral express crew under better circumstances next time.
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken right?
excuse me, sir, but are you the legendary conqueror of demons?
don't worry about it! that misunderstanding is all in the past now.
well, i've done my part, and now i'm simply waiting for the fireworks to begin.
hello, guest from the astral express. i am yukong from the luofu's sky-faring commission. welcome to the xianzhou.
even if the world outside the cage isn't beautiful people still want to know what it's like.
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow
in this world, there are paths beyond waiting for us to explore.
but arlan doesn't care about getting hurt, he only cares about protecting others. it's the only way he feels... fulfilled.
i would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
well then, please look over this tax record. we'll review second life's credit based on your observations.
i know cocolia's style -- get everyone into a frenzy first.
you're saying the kujou clan betrayed the shogunate?
oh, that? that's a hologram. what? i can't possibly summon the real droidhead here, can i?
right on time -- let's start the patrol.
now that the sparring session is over, yanqing and yunli, shouldn't you politely thank general feixiao for her guidance and bury the hatchet?
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
your story is one that has captivated me. i really do have high hopes for you please do your best to live up to them, child.
why would someone as talented as the master diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
twenty years ago, huh i still remember the gardes leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on neuvillette's desk.
which is why i treasure our friendship.
fine, let's smash these metal cans first, then we can talk!
it looks like i wasn't supposed to be privy to the contents of this particular meeting. this simplifies things.
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
alright, no need to look so sullen i'm just kidding. come on, let's eat. the food is getting cold.
or how about this aeur" i'll invest in you early on, before you make it big.
imagine if all the traveler ever thought about was making you stronger, forcing you to build rock-hard muscles just to watch you send mitachurls flying would you gladly comply?
um what's going on?
it's true -- the divination commission really can't go a single day without lady fu.
that's right. we received a letter of invitation from miss alice, proposing that we take klee for a vacation in fairyland when work dies down.
march, calm down.
then i'm afraid things might get unpleasant.
besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the grand narukami shrine unless you had a request for me, too. this is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
i'll arrange for someone to send you home which reminds me, you seem to have some dependable friends with close ties to you.
i'm afraid this is nothing, benefactor
shouldn't we ring the harmonic chime and see if we can talk to yanqing inside the illusion?
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst?
youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. whatever shall we do?
three, two, one mung beaaaan!
i'll be fine. we also have the support of the warriors stationed at the various outposts. given the quick response, things shouldn't get too serious.
there seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. to put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
the underworld has been struggling, but i never tried to help. i didn't even know that it was my own home that had fallen into such a dire state
no ritual at all. we just need to kill some time.
is this some kind of villain entrance line?
you guys figure it out for yourselves. i'm due to catch up with an old war friend i've not seen for quite a long time.
i'm sure this is what captivated director aurelie as well.
the old me? i used to be a knight of beauty.
now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here i believe it's about penacony's past.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. i've been warned that the ones in the mine won't go down without a fight.
yeah, sure. why should i object? not only this sample, but all the goods on the transport ship are yours to keep. like i said, we won't inspect them.
since two of our players are doing this for the first time, though, let me ask
the ten-lords commission planned to execute him, but he managed to escape from the shackling prison. he was severely injured -- he forgot nearly everything.
how's your training going, shenhe? have you made any plans for lantern rite? we could spend it together in liyue harbor, if you'd like?
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
hello there! judging by your clothing, you two must be healers from the alchemy commission. my name is sushang -- i'm a cloud knight soldier. are you looking for the dragon lady who suddenly disappeared?
i overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
but what inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like makoto.
dislike? we were like sisters once -- inseparable. of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian
wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
exactly. liyue is now a nation ruled by humans after all. it's about time we had the power to make a kite fly, don't you think?
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
is everyone ready? let's not keep them waiting.
while you may have good character, do you have any value? don't take that the wrong way, i'm genuinely asking you. you might have some value, i just don't know about it.
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
the ones from before weren't defeated either?
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved"
miss march seventh! have you taken the time to consider my suggestion?
well, if that day comes
even if i lose, i'll still make choices to lighten the loss -- just like the master diviner is making choices for her own agenda.
for my part, i did my utmost to fulfill the duties of a responsible adult.
simply put, pascal's brain is filled with junk information of unknown origin. this junk, along with hardware that's incompatible with his core, caused him to lose his ability to communicate.
as i said, sister, i will handle this.
what a whirlwind of a story! i felt like i was holding my breath the whole time.
ying'er is every bit as proficient as any of the top tailors in the land. i've availed myself of her services many times before.
everything is turbulent and disordered if you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
are you done ordering? then i'll pay up.
so, the children in the clinic heard the story of you and the express, and immediately insisted on sending a gift to the hero of belobog.
i hope that everyone will guard your stations and perform your duties, both for our far-flung colleagues involved in the expedition, and also for the hardworking people of mondstadt.
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons
are you sure you're okay just giving it to eric like that?
as a doctor, i don't accept that -- i'm responsible for their well-being. my attitude towards this "wonder medicine" won't change.
mm. i suppose i never expected that someone like me who was used to staying home would be promoted to such a position.
there's no way someone like him could've come up with the idea of disassembling a sculpture and hiding the pieces inside robots.
when i was little, i thought it was because he really understood me, and agreed with whatever i had to say. so, i'd tell my pops everything.
well, would you like to participate this time? you don't have to bid, of course. just experience the atmosphere.
goodness, i presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
is that so? i'm afraid you're just overthinking things.
this upcoming scene is the two musketeers' final confrontation with the baron. there'll be quite a bit of action, but no choreography beyond what we've already rehearsed.
i asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. no one asked you to criticize my dear old mettle!
i almost lost my cool when he went for his flask
well? did you find the answer yet?
not yet. there's something else we need to deal with.
thanks to her, the antimatter legion outside is not much of a threat anymore. the space station's repairs and reconstruction can also begin smoothly, but internally...
since you weren't around, she thought you had also been grounded, and that it would be a long time before you could come out.
the secret of penacony... may be closely related to the trailblaze.
still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
shortly after these two had begun their match. everyone seemed so focused on the game that i didn't want to interrupt.
the name of the lawrence clan member in question is schubert. lately, he can often be found strolling near the northern city walls.
i know, i know, you've got an important task ahead sorry to keep you. priorities are priorities.
if i had rushed in and out back then, i wouldn't have been much help. instead, i would've postponed the trip and sought assistance from allies, but in that case
miss jade? greetings. the opening ceremony for the charmony festival has been moved to the radiant feldspar, so i'm here making some preparations.
i thought so too at the time. but later when grandpa took me around the zhuming's bakeries, we didn't find the same scent anywhere.
and you too! what about you, mavuika?
i'm not sure, but the heliobi are strange creatures -- even the sharpest sword can't cut them.
we shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of penacony or the family.
ororon probably did everything he could to get away because he knew i'd get the truth out of him sooner or later. that brat, i swear
speaking of attracting attention how do we get a following on a paranormal activity website? sounds like little gui's department -- she used me in some of her performances just to draw a bigger crowd.
that cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. if she detects any change in the underworld, i don't know what she might resort to
i was talking to mister yang about my career as a mechanic and my time in the silvermane guards. somehow, we got onto that so-called engine of creation
but i am serious! and i'll remember every transgression committed against me! ugh, it's no wonder so many people dislike you!
you mean that someone else got here and took everything before us?
leave this to me. you should go meet up with neuvillette.
anyway, we better start preparing now. first, let's see what everyone thinks about the situation.
hehe, i've noticed that you can't keep your eyes off this crown. would you like to try it on?
and guess who arbitrated that case and handed down the sentence? none other than general jing yuan himself.
great idea! shame we don't have any.
for the sake of immersion, please close your eyes, everyone. without the torches, the space is now completely dark, and you cannot see anything.
afterwards, wildfire began to grow. to be honest, i never thought a day like this would come.
yes, and it's all thanks to you.
i heard that you've encountered some problems, and came to see if i could be of some help.
so, i only hope that justice will be served in this matter. don't overthink it i'll go find someone to arrange the meeting
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
what about me? oh, i'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels
an astounding recitation of the ninja mantra, master kucha! i swear i will train hard until i become the dazzling ninja!
alright then, how about you? you've already resumed work as the general mahamatra, right?
i'd rather not play around. we don't have very much time.
in any case, mister boothill, it seems you've put your travels on hold after that incident too. are you enjoying your time in penacony?
now that the alliance has all of you there to help them, sending any elite fighters more would just be overkill.
that's the information i managed to piece together. bladie refused to tell me the details.
something i never have the opportunity to do
but you cannot put mora above all else. you cannot go exploiting children for profit. do you have any idea just how much damage that will cause?
"the goddess of fate used ink to compose her stories on paper, and the goddess of creation used her power to bring those tales to life."
ah that shadow looks a lot like my hand.
wriothesley gets really invested in that sort of thing. but he couldn't care less about what he wins in the end.
it's hard to imagine how he managed to suppress his hunger for over seven centuries. will the hostage from the yaoqing be able to avoid being his meal?
so be it. if indeed he is fate's chosen child
i like to keep my scythe sharp so i can get a good night's sleep on it.
judging from the comments, there were several witnesses. sure, lady bailu runs away all the time, but disappearing into thin air?
i have faith in you. however, before we depart, there is one more thing i must tell you.
hey, no need to lie, nat wouldn't be upset about what we did.
good. in that case, let's first pay madame ping a visit in the city before heading out to jueyun karst.
well, it's getting late. why don't we call it a day for now.
it's something like a tradition of ours. whenever we wrap an important performance, we'll get together and unwind.
why? because he dethroned azar from power?
recently, i have observed a number of changes in the external world from the plane of euthymia. the most serious of these being the attack on the sacred sakura by numerous rifthounds.
a proper manner of speech is more aesthetic than anything else aeur" it stems from their taste for refinement.
it's a strong opening aeur" an easy way to grab the readers' attention. never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
thank you for your help. the culprit has revealed the location where he stashed the statues. we have sent people to collect them.
who knows, perhaps you will have a completely different impression of me after i change outfits.
since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? i'll need your help with the ritual.
in my estimation, there's no question about it. this is murder.
the harmony needs a new direction. only by bidding farewell to the past can we actually sail into the future.
i have to admit, he's a smart guy, and very cautious.
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
i see. well, when you put it that way looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
i prefer to let actions speak louder than words.
however, if you agree to give up that half-baked plan to go public, the ipc will assure you that we'll never jeopardize the interests of the family heads under your leadership.
well technically we didn't find all the parts, and if we called in the experts to put it back together, they would have realized
i have orders to evacuate civilians. see these two behind me? i need to get them out of here quickly. it's too dangerous.
i believe that this "greedy spirit" is most likely an ocean-dwelling fish. if the crystals do attract it to us, then we're a step closer to obtaining our fish scales.
i'll be sure to keep your suggestion firmly in mind.
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
heh i think i know what this is about now. this is interesting.
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it they don't teach this stuff in school. wait did i even go to school?
you wouldn't stand a chance.
this guitar i found it after going through mother's old things.
geniuses like setaria are one in a million. the other children never get a single chance to try and rewrite their fate even though the akademiya knows very well that we're humans, just as they are.
i've instructed yanming to sort through tingyun's belongings. i hope you can pick some out to place around the starskiff.
in which case my lady, could you ask the master to come out and have a chat with us?
while one team is on duty, another is resting, and a third team is on standby in case of emergencies.
*sigh* you said you hate it when i call you "bro" in public! well i agree. it'd sound better if i started using your full name. right, broseph?
if things play out as i expect, dragon fiendling will let slip her true nature in this class.
as a clerk at the hall of karma, my knowledge on these matters is somewhat limited, but i will try my best to satisfy your curiosity. please proceed.
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream and tell mikhail our decision.
you might be able to remain stony-faced if you really try, but with your tail swishing behind you hehe, it tells everything.
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
also, consider this: you have to have the naganoharas, because so many people are emotionally invested in the existence of fireworks.
but just now it all became clear to me. i still don't have the right to come to terms with fate on behalf of everyone else
i caught some very familiar memories just now -- she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. there was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger
everyone has different personalities, so there are some small squabbles here and there
i'm sorry i made you wait earlier. it was actually because i decided to swing by ororon's place to look for clues.
xiangling, you have an adeptal affinity. guoba follows you around because he has respect for you.
not right now, since this meteor shower was originally something like a family legend.
at this point, i would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you but i think you get the picture now, don't you?
nice to meet you, padisarah. i'm nilou, the fairy of this forest. from this day forward, this place is now your home.
the value of items housed here can't be measured in money alone but this little piece of stone could fetch a mountain of cash.
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
kyle, can i ask you a favor? i would like you to visit the residence of minister noel and ask around regarding the whereabouts of mister norbert.
it is an honor to meet everyone.
please follow me. she should be around here somewhere.
behind my back? do you really think you could've walked into the test and sat in the cockpit if i hadn't given my permission behind the scenes?
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
i have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. i'm sure she was as happy as can be.
candace will be okay on her own. i trust her, so you can too.
stay alert. this is clearly no ordinary space.
don't worry, mister svarog. i'm fine.
aaeur"anyway, what are we standing around here for? let's go and check on the status of the stove god statue!
a fun-seeker investigating fun things in the universe -- i guarantee there's no way that could ever go wrong!
i see so he's just as cunning and crafty as ever
i've already concocted some of the medicine in question, but there can't be any further delays. could you assist me in ensuring it arrives on time?
not at all. as long as you have different kinds of sauces in, you can have macaroni and tomato sauce one week, macaroni and bolognese the next
unfortunately, you're unable to adequately assess the source of his injury, much less come up with a way to relieve his pain.
and, in my dream, someone spoke to me. they said: "you are the fairy of the forest of blessings. now go, save the forest with your magic."
when the adepti entrusted humans with overseeing liyue, i knew it was only a matter of time until i had to leave.
schubert can be quite touchy, so it may not be easy to get along with him at first.
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
follow your instinct. choose whichever windblume you see fit.
normally, using devices like the shifting screen is strictly forbidden, as they could help prisoners escape.
during that time, all children of the appropriate age in both the overworld and the underworld will be tested. in the end, only one child deemed as "worthy" will be chosen.
i said why not?
fine, fine, i suppose haste is warranted. lead the way!
he informs you of the various locations where monsters have appeared. he looks in that general direction with a pained gaze, as if a thin, invisible thread is pulling on his wound.
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
the cloud knights have many martial arts traditions. who was it that instructed you in swordplay, young man?
it's been a while. how have you been? i can't say i've been doing well lately myself, but that's normal for me.
so. what's item one on today's schedule?
i had a feeling there would be trouble during the wardance. but throwing both the pirates and the cargo in jail? that's a new one.
yeah. first time in a long time.
but that dream with the masks, each more vivid than the last when i think about it, isn't that an allegory of my life?
looking at these contestants, i suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason
don't worry, i've got plenty. thanks to you two, i recovered more quickly than usual.
that won't be necessary. i've memorized every detail.
if this is fate, then let's grab it in our hands and turn it around.
by the way, if i hadn't caught it and helped it hit its mark, that borisin prisoner would have gotten away.
hmm maybe i should implement some of our scout strategies
you are not wrong. my battle style has always been "simple and effective" -- one cut and it's over.
easy not so much. we can't restore the ley lines without the lord of the night, and i'm not sure she has enough power to do it on her own.
she takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
it symbolizes a chance to introduce ourselves to the cosmos once again -- a heroic kingdom that survived both the legion and the eternal freeze with tenacity.
i should state, i have no idea who the championship contender for this zone is, but i am pretty familiar with the mechanisms.
you have to try this fish. it's found exclusively in the waters around seirai island. they shipped it to inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until i ordered it.
let's focus on the current situation right now. please help me!
you don't know? but surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
yes, but only for those who cross the line. melting their swords is my way of protecting those weapons.
so traveler and paimon, what do you think? interested in the sabzeruz festival? will you two be coming?
understood, miss march. i promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
that was my final question, thank you. we all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.
well, i heard you have some experience with archery and martial arts. the first thing we're going to do is see just how strong your fundamentals are.
he used to say, "books are just a bridge that bring us a little closer to history. it's up to those of us in later generations to ask these questions, search for the answers, and decide what they mean."
consuming this would be physically detrimental. remove it from my presence.
it is. powerful enough to help you repair the veluriyam mirage, with any luck.
a full, complete flight can only be considered as such when it starts with a successful takeoff and ends with a good landing.
you heard the call and knew that i truly did need your help, so why are you hesitating?
we've got quite a long walk back to the city let's take our time. it'll give me a moment to figure out how to explain all this.
since becoming a judge, huohuo has often thought about resigning. she thinks she might not be cut out for the task.
staring at me won't get you anywhere. or, did you want some more tea?
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes truly are sorrowful.
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
there are many kinds of smiles, but only a truly joyous one can bring blessings to others. let's consider this smile a down payment for our future victory.
nice to meet you, klee. i'm yoimiya, and i run naganohara fireworks.
it's also considerably easier to assemble and disassemble. this will allow for flexible deployment, whatever the location.
in their eyes, we're mere consumables, cannon fodder used to slow down xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
good evening! i have a performance at zubayr theater tonight. want some tickets?
this was taken by a member of the master capote fan club less than twenty-four hours ago. in other words, you went to find professor capote today...
it's you again. who's talking to me?
is everyone okay?
perhaps, there will come a day when you'll willingly share your memories with me -- i eagerly await such a time.
luka do you often find stuff for other people?
where are you going, benefactors?
minlin now that was a smooth operation. thinking back on it puts me in a good mood.
if you're interested, i'd be quite happy to do a reading for you two.
so go forward aeur" to the end of your journey, and to the ends of this world!
i never had the chance to receive a good education as a child. that's why i hope to teach these children myself. hopefully i can pass on some of what i have learned.
do i sound that negative? no. we believe that existence has meaning, but that meaning is bestowed by ourselves, not by choices.
you sure you wanna brave the desert alone? i mean, it's your choice at the end of the day, but still
the thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free oh, i just couldn't wait any longer.
so, we'll find tighnari, and convince him to get us the latest intel on the doctor. then, depending on what we learn, we'll make any necessary adjustments to our plan.
thanks. hope to see you again soon.
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
anyways, what i'm trying to say is that we're seeking ways to remove the influence of the stellaron and the fragmentum.
for example, if you "fail" a check, that means you cannot use the target skill in that scenario. a "critical failure" may even result in further negative consequences.
don't know. my grandpa didn't know the specifics, and you've seen how wary baizhu is around me. he'd never tell me anything
you mean the "serial disappearances of young women" case?
uh, hey, miss dunyarzad, i wasn't trying to make you cry. i'm not gonna lose my commission because i made my employer cry, am i?
we have already investigated the situation at eipekkusu. the sales records are correct, but in the cash box, there are two bags in which most of the cash has been replaced with stones.
does "miss sparkle's body" even count as a real character?
i am sangonomiya kokomi, organizer of the resistance, and also the divine priestess of watatsumi island.
here, take it -- the corridor of fading echoes mastery mark -- you've earned it!
it's true. i always wanted to become like her. someone powerful, independent, and with a strong sense of conviction but
we know the essence of your trial of the heart, and we also know that you asked dan heng to help you complete the trial of the mirror.
i just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
the story behind this guitar huh, it'll take a while to tell.
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten complicated.
mister svarog helped to format pascal and integrate him into the base network, but after that
but i just don't know can i really take on such a huge responsibility?
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
mister zubayr and mister khasani took charge of the design, while inayah and i made all the little pieces with the help of others.
we've found bennett here, so albedo can't be far away. keep searching this area.
a world fettered by three paths, its destiny hanging in the balance
he will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. remember, this is the price you pay.
my question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
even more so for mercs aeur" we're looking for our next job before we even finish our current one.
try to focus on that flower
i will say, the train feels a little different now...
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
i actually have something i need to do as well, so i should get to the wangsheng funeral parlor.
these days i just spend my time fixing things in this workshop and playing music. it's a pretty carefree existence.
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
i dunno, uncle tian, you still seem in pretty good shape to me. you might have another few years of work left in you, don't you think?
but as time went by, i received so many thank-you gifts and letters from people everyone was describing how they now saw me in a new light, how i'd become an inspiration to them.
you are guests from afar -- there is no reason for this matter to concern you am i making myself clear?
i have a gift for you, but i'll need a little time to prepare it i'll contact you once it's ready to collect.
how could someone who spent over thirty years working alongside me at the sky-faring commission turn out to be nothing more than a monster in disguise? what happened to the real tingyun?
i'm sorry, i had a meeting with cloud retainer, i
we couldn't cajole adeptus xiao in the end. he said he'd take a peek from the peaks, but that was all he'd agree to. it's a real shame aeur" i had the perfect poem for his entrance and everything.
haha. no, i'm only the divine priestess of watatsumi island. i just like to read light novels and books about military strategy, divination's not my field.
sure do! y'know, i was racking my brains before i boarded the express, but now i've got more ideas than i know what to do with. inspiration is a fickle mistress.
come on, let's go back and see the children.
those guys can't think outside the box. of course they can't wrap their heads around my design. *sigh* i thought it was something big. leave it here. i'll take a look.
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
if uncle schubert didn't commit any wrongdoing, then any such investigation will prove fruitless.
she's been down in the dumps ever since she lost tail.
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
alright, fine i am a person of reason, after all. you're not to blame for this.
i heard that azar and his cronies fell from power, and alhaitham told me that now was a good time to find a job in the akademiya, but only if i wanted to.
unfortunately, there's no way to know without seeing one for ourselves.
now i must take over the duties of the supreme guardian and discard my naive fantasies.
your choice is noted. please keep your eyes closed until i tell you the torches have been re-lit. this battle will be in the dark.
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
i knew you'd want to tag along. let's go.
but that can wait judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
why hello if it isn't the triumphant traveler. and why might you be visiting the shrine? a sign of piety, perhaps?
your words alone will not suffice. ninja initiate merchant, is this truly your intention?
you've clearly heard a lot of folk tales, but that's not the kind of "cursed sword" i'm talking about.
if there's anyone who thinks they can be as headstrong as madam herta, i'd recommend they consider whether or not they possess her intelligence first.
you can see guyun stone forest from here, i trust? it is no natural rock formation aeur" those are giant spears of rock, hurled by rex lapis during the war.
no sweat. this is your first time in belobog -- i just want you to feel some of the warmth the city has to offer.
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
there's a monster heading this way what should we do, gepard?
now that you've had your fun, it'd be wise to leave before it's too late. the music of the harmony doesn't tolerate discord.
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
but what i really saw was just another child, and asked all the same things everyone else did, about rugs, spices, cooking, and the differences between here and home.
everyone, keep your eyes and ears peeled from here on out. we don't know what lies ahead, so we have to be ready for anything.
thank you again for your help this entire time.
don't be upset klee there are many complicated situations in this world which don't always have a logical explanation.
these stairs they seem to have become more narrow.
that's why we should care for the weak and support them as if their suffering were our own that's what the odes of harmony have always taught us.
why do i feel that dragonspine has become more dangerous than it used to be i hope it's just my imagination
there may have been a few heliobi that slipped through the net, but they are of no major concern.
alright. if we happen to come across that yaoqing messenger who got away
i suppose pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
sumeru city, huh i guess it's even more impressive than here?
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
it's fine, tribbie. as we discussed earlier, you need to prepare for the blade of fury.
there's still one more store. are you alright holding onto that much stuff?
yeah. they've always been against us. it wouldn't surprise me if they're using the akasha to intentionally repeat the sabzeruz festival as a sick joke.
if i remember correctly, second life and wanyou boutique are old business rivals, competing for market share due to their similar wares.
to manifest eternity per the almighty shogun's will aeur" that is what i aspire to.
has pascal been waiting for rivet town's evacuated residents to return?
so what are you all doing here? do you need something?
where should we start? should we go to stargazer navalia first? or the artisanship commission?
this has certainly been a memorable series of events.
aggregating the path energy of the erudition, then firing a "bond" at the aeon. this is as good as tapping someone on the shoulder, who's sure to turn back to look at you.
what do you think? be honest. i just want to know your first impression.
recently, however, supplies stored there have started to go missing for no obvious reason.
if you want to move the audience with your music, you must fully commit and immerse yourself in your role, pouring all your emotion into your performance.
i never knew the fateometer even determines the amount of damage you inflict if you get unlucky, isn't it just game over right then and there?
she shuts herself off in her inner world, leaving all the affairs of the outside world to be dealt with by a puppet who has a singular focus on the pursuit of eternity
your name is a special case. there were quite a few headaches along the way, which slowed the progress.
i don't want that to happen. if you guys really believe that you can convince mister svarog then i need to be brave too.
alright, i admit that for a few seconds there, the thought may have crossed my mind.
writing a manifesto takes time, so i informed them of this requirement in advance. these are the reports they submitted.
huh him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
this isn't something the healers at the alchemy commission can handle. i'll take huohuo back to the ten-lords commission -- perhaps they'll have an answer.
i have to investigate this further. i have a feeling that whatever lies behind all this runs deep maybe so deep that no one can be allowed to know.
youhei, i suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. this is a life-or-death situation.
in exchange, i will be accompanying everyone to this letter's golden apple archipelago. as for the knights' affairs, i have entrusted them to kaeya.
he even offered to deliver my gifts to the fortress of meropide for me once he's done with the day's work.
so be it. the sensation is not a disagreeable one.
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up
this is no laughing matter. it's an interrogation.
but anything related to the abyss makes me feel like there is some unknown danger lurking beneath the surface
interesting... i'll have to have a closer look some time.
fine, you do you. all we need to do to convict you is establish that the poison in his system is the same as in uncle tian's.
if you wanna make sure you don't burn yourself out or stifle your creativity, then don't push yourself too hard at work~
when i heard the kids at the clinic talking about this "game," i thought they were just making things up again
wait, hold up, where are you going? don't leave!
because you were created for that purpose -- your body has been transformed by the power of an aeon. you are immune to stellaron contamination.
just pop a thermic core into a lamp, and all the nearby lamps will light up simultaneously -- cool, right?
just think about it if you could combine the knowledge of every single person in sumeru, then you can basically turn sumeru city into a single, massive brain
return to the world? what are you saying?
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia
make sure you live it up tonight! i'll be happy as long as you're enjoying yourselves.
accepting others' wishes and turning them into his own wishes aeur" not all heroes are such blank canvases as him, and that is why the world places such great hopes on him.
have you not sensed it yet? this apparent land of dreams it's a carefully designed dream maintained by the family through unknown means.
it doesn't have to be like that. i'm willing to answer all your questions, but not right now... if my cover hadn't been blown, we might have had more time, but at the moment, we don't have any other options.
that's how outsiders refer to my peers in the zhuming cloud knights and the artisanship commission.
but before you do, i would make a request of you.
we've been business partners for a long time.
i can sense your enthusiasm for the space station, but i'm afraid i have to turn you away.
groundless accusations? mister dongsheng, you seem very sure of yourself.
gratitude won't pay your bills, though don't do this to me, can't we just play by normal business rules here?
hmm i'm not sure if anyone sells this kind of thing, however
it is against the law for a staff member to abuse their position to forge sales records and misappropriate goods!
that's... dan heng and the security department staff!
hmm we still need to ask pascal why he was stealing parts in the first place.
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
one who seeks the way of the ninja is a ninja initiate. one who upholds the way of the ninja is a ninja. and one who lives by the way of the ninja is a ninja hero!
leave it here, and i shall sample it.
i finally managed to get some time off work and thought i'd hop on the express for a chat with himeko. i had no idea i'd bump into you...
additionally, most of the things here are static. so if we really do manage to escape, then once time starts moving normally again the fantastic compass will likely disappear.
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear
toodle-oo to you too. i'm going home to take a rest now.
afraid? well, you do have a different aura from other cursed swords, but you're just trying to use my curiosity to lure me in.
it's not like that! she just has many responsibilities to bear. i don't completely understand, i trust that she's trying to solve the problem.
that's why grandpa hid it from me, so i wouldn't make a hasty decision
understood. this time i won't fall asleep.
let's go -- can't keep a girl waiting, can we?
it's a secret -- and it's a good thing i got here so fast, otherwise you would have missed the fireworks i prepared.
i bought these shoes for you -- i remember the size and the design. this is undoubtedly your footprint.
i'm well aware. but don't you see? zhiyi is gambling everything on this. if we really want to catch him, we're going to have to accept a little risk ourselves.
attempting to storm qlipoth fort by ourselves? forget it, seele. i don't care how skilled you are. i'm not sending you on a suicide mission.
well, no one has ever asked me this before, so i've never really settled on an answer.
well, at least we know what we're looking for now. we just need to keep going. that said the metropole is huge, where do we even start?
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
between us, there have been a few minor incidents. but nothing i haven't already dealt with.
exactly what it means: down.
she even factored my immaturity into her plan.
you hear that? in case it was too subtle for you aeur" thoma's complaining that you guys never make time to come and visit your old pals.
an outstanding piece of musical work is just like a mirror. only through comparison and reflection can shortcomings be found in time.
i thought that the story between you and the fungi would follow a master-servant paradigm, but you offered something even better: companionship, based on mutual understanding.
so you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "the miraculous adventures of the traveler."
the iridescence tour is relatively unknown in liyue. it's difficult to predict how a brand-new show will be received.
we need a slogan to go with the picture. ugh i wish i'd read more books. any ideas?
the shrine maiden i tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. you'll know her when you see her.
the battle is still far from over.
what's the point of performing a show that its audience can't even follow?
yes! the mighty blessing of the reignbow arbiter annihilated all abominations in a single strike! but we had to pay with the blood of hundreds of thousands of soldiers just to halt their advance!
you have a very distinct scent. losing one sense forces the other senses to become sharper.
in the dark of shadow, our heroes seek to find, where creatures born of evil, weave their grand design.
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
s--so, your memory module is okay?
that fish one with the misleading name. sounds bland, but it's drowning in hot chilis.
there's been no noise, no bright lights, no nothing! i couldn't have asked for anything more!
of course i've read it! i've always had a keen interest in artistic works that strike a chord with the populace.
oh? if there's anything i can help you with, just tell me straight away. no need to hesitate.
yo, what's up! you're finally here! without you, our ghost-hunting squad would be nothing!
candace and i came to caravan ribat on business. we ran into cyno as he was asking about some elderly gentleman's whereabouts.
it's bad -- really bad. their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
the towns' resources have been swallowed up by the fragmentum. to get anything now, people have to risk their lives!
this caravan is just one link in their logistics chain. once in the rainforest, the caravan will exchange the looted goods for mora, and the funds will then be passed to a specific person.
"go forth and establish a city of freedom without rule." we have not forgotten barbatos' wish for mondstadt.
you frightened me for a second aeur" i thought my illusion had been undone by a bunch of monsters how did you find this place?
the materials that mingxi and xiaohan provided were super useful.
the more the merrier, these guys are nothing! hold the line!
ding-a-ling -- i won~
i guess all i can say now is thanks for agreeing to help.
i know what i'm doing, dunn! step aside.
sure thing, mister skott. you seem pretty confident that your career and life will last long enough to witness this victory unfold.
do you now realize how dire the consequences of wild speculation can be?
it's been a while, kujou sara. i believe the last time we met was on the battlefield.
to be brutally honest, "we took out a loan and made a speculative investment" is not a sob story.
after all, we need to watch you practice for a few days before we can figure out how talented you are, right?
the memory zone is constantly shifting its form. looks like we'll have to think of a way to walk on the ceiling.
don't worry, sushang. right now, i'm cool as a cucumber inside a block of ice!
you could capitalize on the rave reviews and license out "the little oceanid" to the bigger theater troupes out there. that would do wonders for your financial situation.
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do
afterward, he said to the dendro archon, "i miss my parents, my wife, and my children. i've been away from home for far too long. they must be worried."
i quickly learned that every card back with that particular design had been scooped up overnight. there's not a single one left in all of liyue.
when you are free sometime, i'll take you to one of my favorite scary places to test your mettle -- what do you say?
it looks like the "endgame" that general jing yuan has been trying to avoid is fast approaching. sushang, please head to the seat of divine foresight and fetch the general.
now that these guys have finally shown up, it's a huge weight off my mind. bring it on, you abominations!
ah i was wondering if we might run into her
that's just the nature of the foxians. it's widely known that mystery is the key to our allure.
this is... a dead end.
come on, you're too modest for your own good.
aww, you just can't bear to see me go, huh? come on then, let's go together.
last time you entered the plane of euthymia, it was in front of the statue of the omnipresent god, correct?
at least, that's the view i held in the past. only more recently did i start to realize that the only barriers are ones that i have erected with my imagination.
himeko and mister yang and who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
that's the one. actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. it's a spell to help calm the ley line memories.
i don't know where hat guy went we just saw layla not too long ago, though.
remember, to get to port ormos, just follow the river south from sumeru city's port.
but i disagree. robots have their own thoughts and feelings
a loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. she is worthy to be called a hero. with an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the kujou clan is assured.
not bad. the courtyard furnishings are very nice, and the scenery in the distance is really one of a kind.
which is why we must stop that monster before it gets any closer to liyue harbor!
well, yeah, i mean, that's why our name is on the event. it's well-known throughout inazuma.
that's just it -- there is no deal
so, let me introduce myself. i'm the intelligence officer for the silvermane guards, and a temporary guide for the "a journey through belobog's history" program. my name is pelageya sergeyevna.
powering the audience system alone required me to reconfigure the energy supply of the entire space station! i had to switch it to hibernate mode before rebooting everything. do you have any idea how much that costs?
so you mean that it symbolizes dreams?
that door over there is the only way out we'd better close it
someone with no spiritual sensitivity whatsoever. spirit-duffers can't sense or control spirits, much less use spells on them.
the novel that i've been reading for a while finally reached its end. but the heroine lost her memory, and the planned wedding fell through that's so sad
tsk, tsk, little pawn, must you force me to intervene directly? i'm loath to flout my philosophy of destruction.
i'm here on behalf of the tenryou commission, of course. is that surprising?
it's just two hundred but i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
in that case, let me try again aeur" this time using both leyla's body and the shard as mediums.
it is not my intention to interfere with the merchant guild's affairs, but as an old friend i would like to remind you that aurum alley only exists in the present, not in the past.
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague
since she's not here i guess the next step is to check all the other adepti abodes, one by one.
but i don't know when or where it'll happen, so i figured i can search while i travel.
welcome to reality. more specifically, the reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
say, caiyi i really didn't think you'd come back do you really like flying starskiffs that much?
well now, don't you all look disappointed? don't tell me that your investigation came up empty-handed?
now, i can embark once more on my journey as a "traveler of no return," exploring the paths that lie beyond.
what do you think, hook? are you willing to buy the geomarrow probe from me?
it's amazing how many songs are stored in its library. someone must have paid big money to get all the copyright issues sorted.
you never know something very exciting might happen!
as a precaution, please bring sufficient combat equipment and supplies with you.
while you may be a ray of hope that fell onto amphoreus, you may also be a threat to amphoreus. you leave me no choice but to shut the doors of your fates.
but let's make a deal. how cooperative you are now decides how much immunity i give you when this gets investigated.
when ayato approached me about holding the test of courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help chizuru face her problem.
oh, is that so? and if i may ask, what did you hear while you were inside your box?
what represents the boundaries of mortal knowledge? many people think it's the genius society, but i think it's myself.
but if you like, i could give you all a small private show any time.
i have to thank you, mister assistant detective. but the puzzle this time is pretty strange.
if you choose to play in "authentic mode," every time you elect to use a skill, you'll need to use the fateometer to see whether you succeed or fail, and face any consequences that may follow.
moving on. don't try, but you wouldn't even begin to imagine how difficult it is to send a message to nous. and i went all out for it
*sigh* if i'm not careful i'll start boring you all with sob stories from the past. let's get back to you guys. if long-lost bronya told you to come here, you must have something important to tell me?
friends? oh, please. you guys only treat others as your bargaining chips.
that i'd like to do? why are you asking?
i can't imagine it how will i feel when i have to face pascal after being forgotten so many times?
it's alright, i've got gepard with me -- we'll be safe. see you in a bit!
it might be possible to use another heliobus to drive out the one that seized huohuo's mind.
as a mortal, i've never dared to imagine a liyue without rex lapis.
you're too modest. to that memokeeper girl salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall was worth much more than that.
i'll take this direction, and leave the other one to you. let's meet up again later.
maybe we can discuss the tales of legendary heroes. have you heard the story of the heroic king of khaenri'ah?
and thus i became the daughter of madam cocolia. my only identity is that of guardian successor, but i'm not good enough
over here, clara! wanna learn some cool poses?
surely you jest. i would never intentionally make things difficult for my players.
huh? wait, you mean the suspense thriller novel that was a number-one bestseller?
of course they did! when people mention the gods, they always think of the archon war, but sumeru's gods also had happy times.
of course that wouldn't work. neither do i have any intentions of pushing ninja initiates to adopt the way of the dazzling ninja.
monologues aside, there's still plenty of work to do to get the alley back on track. the dock still needs your help.
oh, nothing. it's just you don't see things like this every day.
this game will be over soon this time, we're going to catch her.
oh, really? i think that towering tree looks pretty impressive.
then my duty as her eternal familiar is to drag her back out of her own head and into the real world.
interesting, now you want to talk. seems you've had a change of heart.
candace and i bumped into these two while we were strolling through the streets.
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
what? how is that possible? i need a moment to wrap my head around this
no matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
i said, why haven't you left?
therefore, i took advantage of the situation and changed the threat from "banishment" to "execution," to see if the two could remain firm under the most extreme pressure.
so lyney proceeded to knock him out too before stuffing him into that box.
how about it, this journey of beautiful dreams was it to your liking?
do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if i have a sure loss in front of me? no -- the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
get hold of the stellaron before cocolia realizes what's happening!
a "guardian of humanity" that can command robots? i've never heard of anything like
fiendling pest! what tricks did you pull on ninja initiate merchant?
i won't treat you as hostiles, and in exchange, i hope you won't make things difficult when it comes to keeping secrets. i'll do what i can to find a way out.
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete right?
i used to be terrified of the gaze of other people, especially when they had suspicion or resentment in their eyes.
elio said that you would help me. i wonder how many possibilities he saw before he got a glimpse of that reality
okay i get it. i'll make a trip to qlipoth fort and tell bronya what i really think.
you can trust me. i know our paths have only crossed once before, but my intuition tells me you guys are good people. and i've got good intuition by the way, haha.
don't worry about locked doors, benefactors, we can use the conveyor belts.
first, look at those two sky-faring commission staff members. they've been observing us in secret since we arrived here.
greetings everyone, i hope i'm not intruding.
possibly. they always think ahead.
actually, i didn't need any answers -- he made them all up himself.
she's been guarding aaru village for quite some time now. if anyone is qualified to question the offenders, it's her.
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
it's someone you know. wanna take a guess?
you're right. even though i'm not a fan, i'll help you figure something out.
but i know nothing about swordplay or duels. now, if you're talking about playing celestial jade, that's something i might be able to help with.
although i've made quite a few "mutually assured destruction" buttons, it's not like i'm going to blow up everything i see
that's the kind of treasure i've always yearned for, but the general's position won't allow him to accept such a gift.
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
oh, come on you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
not a chance! curiosity can be perilous, you know. don't forget my warning, the less you know, the better.
if you think the current budget will not suffice, then we'll simply have to apply for more funding from the ministry of civil affairs and wait for their approval.
from before the memory loss, before the express
don't you think the poetry and songs of the xianzhou people are enchanting? one time i asked shangshang to teach me to write poetry, and she only wrote four words in three months i don't think i'll be able to learn at this rate.
you can come, present or not. the gift exchange is just to make the celebration more entertaining.
the depth he goes into in each and every area means it can only be a product of painstaking work. plus, he is modest and good at dealing with people.
so keep your cool. follow me, the farewell ceremony site is just up ahead.
no fluctuations detected. a step will not be recorded.
let me be clear, the questions i'll ask might not reflect my actual thoughts. so, please don't take offense if any of my questions seem a bit harsh.
sorry, that's what the rules say
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here
i hope you really give this a good shot, you and haniyyah. the future of this highly entertaining tournament depends on the decisions you make from now on i'm excited to see what you've got in store for us.
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
and what's more, there were plenty of suspects invited. do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that "black hole" you're wielding?
clervie's words probably gave them the excuse they were looking for. whether they actually believe them to be true is secondary.
ah, speaking of which, miss eris was just looking for you -- why don't you go to the museum and talk to her?
clorinde is right, though. you really are reliable!
i know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the dreamscape than others. this is also why i have to accompany you.
still, your idea is very sensible. mora can only lift a weary spirit. it cannot alleviate physical fatigue.
you didn't actually have to come to mt. tianheng. go back to liyue harbor, find a guide at the yuehai pavilion, and
this information was left by a thaumaturge called boyang who, as you know, is the missing ancestor that i came here to investigate.
no ifs, no buts. we've recovered the goods. as agreed, this is sufficient to establish his innocence.
you won't even stand up for your own apprentice? what kind of master are you?
but you've been looking forward to the dance of sabzeruz so much, and i know how important this festival is to you. i don't want you to have any regrets
it's unfortunate -- the six-phased ice that once enveloped her carries its own mysteries, and miss march has amnesia about her own past
practices? come on, you make it sound like the "long-standing practices" in this alchemy commission are something great.
that said, i hear that yae publishing house's novels are all reviewed by miko herself.
i've captured the nature of the medicine in my censer.
how did he do it? getting past all the guards with a limp, and sneaking in here to start a fire
i imagine this must have taken baishi completely by surprise.
oh, it's you. you came with me after all.
if you're trying to accommodate me, there must be some misunderstanding. i'm fine. there's nothing embarrassing about running into colleagues in the wild.
so my plan is to incite rebellion in the tenryou commission.
although we now know why he took them, there are still many unanswered questions. for example
the results of insight checks aren't disclosed to the players, so i'll be the one consulting the fateometer.
my apologies, i have a lot of business to attend to at present -- i won't be joining you. good luck recovering the stolen items.
there. now do you see what i mean, mister yang?
the lord of the night should now be able to appear anywhere in natlan. what we need to know is where the ruler of death can be summoned.
this food street is great. it really captures that urban feel of chihu rock.
if you're ever free to visit the space station, please come check in on us. we all miss you.
yes. zhiyi's not the one i'm interested in. if he was as far as this went, i'd have handed the case off to my subordinates as soon as i realized.
alright. seems like the problem inside has been suppressed.
you see? you can perceive some spiritual abnormalities now. congratulations.
alright, let's get started. remember, you must be graceful and elegant. don't get knocked or launched into the air, that would be most unsightly.
hmm. maybe the fatui want to cover up some secret of the balladeer? is that why they tried to seize haypasia?
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
mm... i need to feel the pressure he's feeling so i can understand what it's all about.
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
an outlander has never received an ancient name before. i wouldn't be surprised if something equally unprecedented happens when you connect to it
this isn't a clue, it's just a brand of tea i liketwo cups a day keeps the tiredness at bay.
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
don't fret. all amicassadors know their way around a starskiff.
there are quite a few curios on the express that i've only seen in the catalogs, though i'll need to see them up close before i believe them...
-- i've decided to forego my role, and never step foot on the charmony festival's stage again.
combat is like smelting -- purging the impurities with burning flames and exposing a person's true nature.
as time went on, new exhibits were continually added to the memorial until it became the museum we see today.
ah, i remember now. the minister of transportation, noel, has a nephew named norbert -- i believe he's currently working in the municipal department as a transportation coordinator.
i am glad to finally meet you in person, guests from the astral express. i'm feixiao, the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
i'm not joking around, and i'm not making up some crazy story
they are as follows: sunset vermillionite, wonder cores, and adepti sigils.
i accept your challenge, hoolay. because the very moment you stepped aboard the skysplitter, you stepped onto your path to ruin.
you think you look alike?
they set out together, but only one of them made it back minus his sanity.
no matter what stance we take when dealing with them, the outcome is always the same our efforts only result in adding more fuel to the flames.
oh, interesting! i wasn't thinking about it like that. i suppose it's not so different from an acting troupe, everyone has their own role to play.
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
*sigh*, i'm not sure you guys will agree, but
now that that's settled, let's go pay a visit to the museum lobby secretary, eris. she's a talented worker and can tell you everything there is to know about museum matters.
there will come a day when he leads everyone aeur" everyone we have left aeur" through the gates of the miracle.
she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
--they are not scum!
dunyarzad's just an ordinary person. there's no way a god would be so involved in the lives of everyday people unless they were truly compassionate.
yeah. there was once a time when i was an actress in a masquerade, seeking only to hide the truth
traveler, take care of paimon. yanfei, you might need to come closer to me when the time comes.
well hang onto it, it's cute.
if mastering conversation is akin to the skill of archery, then i am confident i can improve with more practice.
my friend once said to me that only people with a strong will and a clear purpose decide to go traveling. maybe it's to see a certain view or to fulfill a certain wish
well, we have made quite a bit of trouble for you recently. how about this? you can pick any one object here as you please, and you may take it with you.
quick as lightning, always keeping her word -- that was her way of doing things. back then i thought we'd be friends for life.
i'll divide the reports into two piles. you take one, i'll take the other. when we're finished, we'll put our heads together.
our aim is to organize a memorable lantern rite. the budget is there just to facilitate planning, we mustn't lose sight of our goal.
don't worry, i'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
when my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
the longer one works as a judge, the more they understand one fact -- of all the people in this world, none is without blemish.
hunting is not a game, it is a battle of life and death. are you ready for your death, abomination!?
you're a smart merchant, old oti. isn't the whole purpose of this elaborate game to showcase your business acumen and seek more benefits for the family?
it's a deal then. next time you need something done in the workshop, i'll do it for free!
so pascal used to be a robot guardian of rivet town
until i grew up, and learned the true face of deshret's relics for myself.
in return, i give you a blessing from me: good luck. i'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.
now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. it does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
gepard brother. surely now you can see the need for pragmatism?
before he left, mister sharif looked like he had a lot on his mind.
there's nothing more to say, gepard. the decision is yours.
ahem! now that that's settled time to get going. qingce village is said to be home to a lot of historical texts, so i'd like to start by making some inquiries there.
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
why does life slumber...? we don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream.
if it was any other day, that would be your next logical step. but today, you've got me on your team, so you get an extra tip.
so, they hired a group of experienced guild adventurers to escort them through the desert.
she doesn't think that we can win the debate, and she doesn't want to implicate us, so she thought leaving was the best thing to do
oh, no, i was just thinking about how those nobles must be so cold-hearted. it's like they don't care about their people at all!
okay, so what are we waiting for? let's get moving and see if we can find some witnesses.
though there's always something to do, with everyone lending a hand, i always feel at ease.
hmmm i say that's a good title. what does everyone think? alrighty then, it's decided.
i misjudged the situation and offended you. my apologies.
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
i'll give you a hint. it's to do with the yae publishing house.
for me, the truth or lack thereof is not what matters in this game
even though i lacked the talent to pilot the starskiff and wasn't much of a warrior, i still chose to travel around with the merchant guild.
where did those things come from? corrupted data? reanimated systemic rust? no, not likely it can't be the legion's second ambush, right?
the master diviner must have launched the campaign while we were delayed in the artisanship commission.
is that right? then i guess mister albedo must be an artist working with the yae publishing house.
unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "death."
and all the while, i played my part to perfection to convince them that was true
are you ready? i have high standards, you know.
the plan was never a secret. or, i guess i should say there was no point to keeping it a secret. a simple investigation from ororon would reveal everything.
i think i'll stay here for a bit longer. the show is still not quite over in my heart.
i know you have many questions do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme
should you harbor any thoughts, this is the moment to bring them forth.
someone's full of energy! you don't look like a xianzh--
fyxestroll garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen foxian fighters at the foxsomn tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
i mean, we needed an excuse for your behavior anyway surely insanity counts?
don't look at me. he's the one who came up with this idea. it's up to you to accept it or not, svarog.
let me know if you see her, alright? i'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. she always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
are you bored, welt? i understand but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
he only wants everyone to return safely to rivet town and live their peaceful lives like before.
stand down, moze. i am here, hoolay. what do you wish to say?
it's just a minor error. this kind of thing was bound to happen. a small modification to the shogun should fix it.
thanks to them, inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
very well, since the president has come to a decision, i will be in charge of calling a public meeting.
ah i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises
the stage is going to be even prettier when it's festival time! i can't wait for you to see it!
so i will ask you once more have you made up your mind, phainon of aedes elysiae?
even if cirrus doesn't know where tail is, given the shared history, they wouldn't hesitate to cause trouble
the fount of knowledge and boldness of spirit that your travels have bequeathed upon you are sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
i'm not sure. there don't appear to be any changes however, the many doubts that once plagued me have dissipated.
in addition to her secretarial duties, eris is also a student at the belobog college of art. she's very knowledgeable about the museum's exhibits and their history.
no. she was not created to ever be turned off.
um, if you don't mind i still have important things to do. i'll go back now.
even my sword feels more at home in my hand now. like an extension of my own body.
i have no doubt about general feixiao's capabilities, general huaiyan. i'm more concerned about the wardance.
yes, and also never mind, i'll just show you. it won't eat up too much time.
how often do you get the chance to work with yourself? just imagine how in sync we'll be with one another we're bound to thrive and prosper!
there are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward?
so you heard my announcement, did you? what do you think? interested?
looks like you've been keeping an eye on the skysplitter. have you noticed anything unusual?
thanks to captain gepard, we managed to keep our losses to a minimum. i'm sure people will begin to appreciate the silvermane guards after this battle.
so if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. relax, if i need your assistance, i won't hesitate to ask.
he had long since come to some understanding. i could sense a mix of intricate emotions flowing out.
when the marechaussee phantom searched pierre's house, there was no sign of these barrels, right?
i ran into a wizened lady there. she was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
respect must be given to the will of every creature. each fish in the ocean swims in its own direction.
a great many things are still unaccounted for
this is a human society aeur" at the moment, anyway aeur" and i'm just doing as i please.
it makes things easier for the craftsmen. it's not like outsiders can just walk in here.
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
mister svarog, it's such a massive vein. i've never seen so much geomarrow before
"a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. if we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
remember, you must be elegant don't get knocked or launched into the air.
when the jade chamber fell, countless valuable items from my collection plunged into the sea. i organized a salvage operation, but still there were many items unaccounted for.
oh, no, it's alright. i actually think i understand the magic of this world a bit better now. thank you.
three, two, one what's the word again?
i'm not there. turn back.
the stage is already set, so there's no reason to disappoint the audience. let's see this trial through to the very end!
hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. i'm really glad i decided to come to qiaoying village.
in penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes that includes me. i can't deny this, nor do i seek forgiveness.
however, if a not-so-reasonable person insists on approaching, that's when the weapon racks come in handy.
you have one chance, and i'm warning you: don't make me ask twice
everyone that came said that you saved sumeru, and wanted me to thank you all on their behalf.
i think it means "beard" or something. believe me, it's a really stupid name i've found it insufferable for years.
apart from the incense that helps you sleep, there's also something i trust you will like.
she'll figure out what's best for her soon enough. oh aeur" and if you'd like to see lyney after the show you know where he'll be. the usual haunt.
by "salvage," i mean to slowly get close to those memories, and then exert my memokeeper power to retrieve them.
the memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. but when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products
if she asks you, just let her know my reasoning. she'll understand.
you seem to be enjoying yourselves here.
no! it's a tear! those bad guys did it!
(huh? does that mean hu tao also knows!)
haha. the matra have all the talent they need as long as they have cyno. i prefer to be free to live however i choose.
since you're so curious, i'll give you the whole story.
(heh, just messing with you i'm a legendary shaman of my tribe, now that i know the cause, of course i can figure out how to fix it.)
yes. they attach themselves to sentient beings, feeding off their host's experiences and emotions.
is this the lesson you learned from your journey in liyue?
if you don't say anything, then all the hard work we've put into embroidery practice would have gone to waste.
by the way, this plan still requires a performer, right?
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful
what are you afraid of? surely you don't think that aurelie's story is unworthy of the grandest stage in fontaine?
we'll mostly be filming typical people and scenery from the streets today to improve the sense of environmental ambiance in some parts of the film.
oh, i have some dice in my pocket. why don't we have a little fun?
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
i've been monitoring the dark web -- i barely managed to stop the video from spreading. the incident hasn't grown any bigger -- for now. how are things with you?
if i'd known there were so many high-tech wonders on the express, i probably would've insisted on going with you guys.
what, still something you want to talk about? alright, let's make it quick.
not bad. i suppose this is a step forward for you. but i'm afraid
the boss he appeared suddenly after the guards were redeployed, and became a major player in the underworld.
i'm alright now. you don't have to accompany me any further. the butterflies that i felt from before are all gone now.
thunder and lightning can be quite frightening, but don't worry aeur" liyue's storm and fire defenses are second to none.
uh she's not trying to be diplomatic about it, is she?
of course i do. it was never my intention to place control of inazuma into anybody else's hands.
hmph, you don't look too bright, but it turns out you have a knack for scheming
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
there's a fault with one of the energy supply units at the base. if i don't repair it soon, everyone at the settlement will be affected.
of course. i just didn't appreciate how nice it was at the time.
the last time i came here on a starskiff was let me think about twenty years ago now. i've been on the road for so long that i've started to forget the sights and sounds of the xianzhou
traveler, i know what that look means. what's on your mind?
mengming, the owner of the sleepless earl, went to great efforts to set up her shop, all so that workers like us can catch a break and find some joy in our lives!
a few days ago, the spiritfarers received reports about an ipc transport ship that was attacked by borisin. then, a bunch of those abominations were dumped into this place.
it was a song with a harmonic tune.
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
then close your eyes, and make a wish to the goddess of fate. we will help make your wish come true.
it's not like that. you're making this too complicated
i just can't help but feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
thank you. i'll be in my room.
just our luck none of them are here today.
so. what does dodoco do after getting to inazuma?
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
though the strike from the general was timely, its destruction was also immense. when "emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
according to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
i've tried talking to her, but you know how she is she uses her wit to talk circles around anyone
um not quite my taste. "high speed" doesn't quite do the express justice.
claw was only this big when we first met. he was huitzilin's saurian companion back then. she kept dragging him to my place, so, over time, we got to know each other.
you mean leave the plane of euthymia?
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
i'm hu tao, the current director of the wangsheng funeral parlor, responsible for well, trifling matters having to do with mortality.
don't worry, paimon. i've already thought of a variety of stratagems for the match.
anyway, someone must be looking after this place. but who?
correct. that medicine is a wolf in sheep's clothing -- wildfire has cut off the supply chain.
i can't just ignore what i saw. that's why i need the traveler's power. i need the power of a descender.
defeating signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
now, if you'll excuse me, i'll be leaving now.
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
on any other day, that'd probably be a good idea. unfortunately, it's not gonna work today.
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
of course, if that's all there was to it, i wouldn't look into it any further.
ah, i see. well, i shall continue walking while you go greet your friend.
i think i've figured out what's motivated march to learn swordplay.
i've been on my feet all day. i don't have the energy for more headaches right now. let me catch my breath and i'll come find you tomorrow.
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream we can just head to the place i mentioned later
you don't have to join me if you don't want to. i can go sort out the firework materials and the boat by myself, and then you can come and meet me back at the house later.
oh! no, not at all! i could do with a hand, actually
maybe you'll find something that catches your eye.
so, ningguang organized a private meeting with miss charlotte to ask for her help in fostering cooperation with the right people.
at least, that's the most reasonable explanation i can think of.
just don't let me down now, okay?
time for your second test. i'll be your examiner this time, and i'll be testing your ability to defeat enemies with unconventional moves.
they were completely different when i first met them.
agreed. whoever it is will continue to follow us.
his childhood, his studies, the thing with his neighbor none of these are recent events. so why are these stories only going around now?
next time, i'll have to convince mister svarog to come along.
so i promise you that should you one day require financial assistance, you may seek employment here. i will pay you at the highest rate of remuneration.
personally, i consider this project to be of greater importance than the jade chamber rebuild. that's why i'm here to supervise.
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
however, i have visited those planets.
i have to admit that these little ones born in the process sometimes move me.
i i'm honored to have been able to take part in this plan! i hope you liked the dance i dedicated to you!
these poor little things stumbling about
we're standing on the ceiling right now.
but today, lord phainon okhema needs you.
i've been wondering which came first: the audience or the performance?
also, be sure to tell them that though the lantern rite may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
i can't say that i know her very well, but i think she just has a lot on her mind, and is trying to come to terms with her feelings.
i'm not sure why, but i'm getting nervous again.
now that the fading disorder is cured, i'm sure the forest will be a lively place again in no time.
judging from how active the robot was, its core isn't just scrap metal. it should be repairable.
later on, i realized that it's actually like what mister afshin said aeur" by taking the freebies, i was helping everyone out and saving them money.
seeing as i have nothing better to do, i'll comply.
good. leave nothing of value behind.
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee)
yes, those photos are not just ordinary records of her trips. to miss march, they are dearly precious memories.
i'm afraid it won't be wise for us to continue our investigations together, mister boothill.
we can move out any time. let me know when you're ready.
it's nothing more than an empty threat, much like before aeur" a reflection of their inner fears.
the old me? i used to be a devil hunter.
i think we need a little private time. see you soon.
from the back, it looks like a ledger. but it seems they also use it as a site log.
i learned something new today i never knew that the hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
these uninvited guests keep talking about "asset evaluation," whatever that means. all i know is they're seriously disrupting the lives of the underworlders!
i'm just a doctor -- there's not much i can do to assist you. these are medicinal pellets that the alchemy commission hands out to field doctors -- you might find them useful in an emergency. take them.
i wrote to my mom about the recent monster-slaying and demon-fighting stuff i've been doing for the ten-lords commission.
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is
come on, i need to look around a bit more before i can be sure
the cream of liyue's mercantile crop all see "ascending to the jade chamber" as the greatest honor. each brings rich gifts as they visit, all to curry a little favor with ningguang.
sure sounds complicated, but it seems like if everything goes well, we'll be able to get rid of all the guards in the akademiya without any effort
there's nothing but a jigsaw puzzle here.
going for the big reveal right at the beginning would have been an anti-climax of the most literal kind. i wanted to see how you'd react in a situation like this, and you did not disappoint
reliable as ever, miss president.
it's all right. there's no cure for such a symptom.
with all due respect, you don't honor your sword, so you don't deserve it.
maybe mister svarog believes pascal will harm someone else eventually, which is why he keeps telling me to let go.
another case was where i offered distinctly more competitive terms in an investment, and this ended up arousing their suspicion.
so it's true? the wangsheng funeral parlor really does have a secret art?
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
that's a tough one, alright there's plenty more besides memories held in the ley lines.
it's ironic to think that in my whole time as a "god," i could only ever dream of receiving this kind of power
that's the spirit, sounds like you're all fired up! if you could just keep your legs from shaking so much, it would be more convincing, march.
i've never had such a dream before. in most dreams, i just go from one mask to another
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
well how else was i supposed to save your skin from the balladeer, exactly?
as for "genius," don't mention that word to me again.
bronya! i didn't know you'd stick up for us like that back there -- well said!
currently, there are three ways an aeon can perish known to humanity.
in the past, our people have been subjected to lengthy interrogations on arrival in watatsumi, and the same has been true for your people on arrival to narukami.
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe this is just too surreal.
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
now it is time for the final battle.
you may not be young, but your mindset is still that of a fresh-faced newbie who spends all their time on work, while proudly proclaiming to "love their job."
i'm a doctor, not an informant! very well, what's the question?
compared to you, mercs like me are just third-rate amateurs i've got no actual fighting skills to speak of. but that also makes it a whole lot easier for me to gain the locals' trust.
it was close to the statue of the seven. back then, the people of this island recognized the shogun's existence, despite not venerating her as the shogunate do.
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
wait, this part on the last page sounds strangely familiar
miss tingyun, what's this about?
don't worry, what with me being a knight of favonius, they're usually willing to speak a few words with me.
tell me the truth sampo -- what are you gonna do about the overworld girl?
uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy
it's unlikely we'll be able to climb back up that far. we'll need to find another way.
ugh, how can you call me a weirdo? i mean, wouldn't you say it's more charmingly naive? or disarmingly different?
why would i dare leave through the main entrance after smashing the aurumatons?
the issue isn't the projector, but the microfilm that goes into it. it's the most crucial piece of this exhibit, and it was stolen.
the ipc does have more capital on hand, but the review criteria are not solely focused on financial resources.
still, that doesn't help us much. the ship is huge, with changing conditions across various delves. i'm sure there were showers across many of them at the time.
excuse me, are you talking about the clock studios theme park incident?
they received eternal life as they had desired, but are doomed to a fate more terrifying than death. the abundance played a cruel trick on them.
as the raiden shogun they revere, i should not be the one to hold them back.
this is a new type of firework which has been modified by the ministry of civil affairs. i've heard that you are fond of gadgets, so i've brought one for your amusement.
the facilities here seem to be in pretty good shape, not like those of a place that has been abandoned for years.
stop deluding yourself. these new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
every participant in this auction was hand-picked by me, based on certain intelligence.
whoa! nice! there were no witnesses, so this never happened, alright?
if he paid more attention to his affairs, it'd save me a lot of headaches i guess i do create a few headaches for him too maybe we're even.
i'm going too. we can't let these thugs get away with whatever they like!
not at all, just doing what you asked. how about we call it even as payment for the healer lady's consultation?
that you choose to show up here proves that you have more bravery in you than i had originally thought. and now that you are here, i have a proposal
to penacony's past, present, future and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
my, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
as guuji of the grand narukami shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. only then am i capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
well, you should probably write down the recipe now, no?
i'm sorry to make you run errands with me during our big festival. i promise to make this quick, and i'll be sure to get you back in time to enjoy the fireworks show.
ohhh no wonder he left his post for so long that day.
as for all the belongings left by the kaedehara clan, i will deal with them promptly.
make sure to take good care of it until the opening of the charmony festival. then, when the show reaches its climax -- press the button together with the others around you
but i dared not speak. i could only gaze at him in silence until the moment i awoke.
hmph, jing yuan trained you alright
hey, how about i gather a few mercs to escort you two whaddya say?
in the end, the lantern rite planning was left to keqing and myself. i am the head organizer, while keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
it's settled, then. traveler and paimon, please go get some rest. i'll go find you in qingce village when i'm done.
*sigh* i wanted to keep it with me but that's the problem with old things -- the less you use them, the easier they break. besides, no one's paying me to fix it, right?
they have other things to take care of first. we couldn't afford to wait for them, but they'll join us later.
i've hunted down hundreds of swords like this so far, and every single one of them has been melted down!
i'm sure she was simply trying to share some of her enthusiasm, in the hopes that you may find it infectious.
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
hehe, it's fine, i'm indebted to you. this really is the best solution at the moment.
(there is definitely more to mister zhongli than meets the eye. i could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
oh? you want to learn more about the gates? well, as you heard earlier, the gates are basically eight key nodes in liyue's ley line network.
i'm sorry, my lady, but this is just the kind of man he was. he probably saw this box as some kind of personal trash heap, and dumped any and everything in here
heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. there are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us why don't we just leave it at that for now?
there's supposed to be a passage why can't i see it?
alright, i'm done here, time for me to go. i'm heading off again in a few days, and i still have to prepare.
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning
maybe he's on a victory high? or maybe not. either way, it's classic luka.
i was there many times when i was supervising the festival construction, but i haven't been there since.
a... note? looks like instructions from the butler for the other servants.
as a knight and a member of the lawrence clan, it's my duty to make sure he doesn't bring harm to others.
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
i don't know how to explain it, but all i know is that when my performance makes the audience happy, i also become very happy.
technically speaking, he and i are under an employer-employee relationship. it didn't feel right to have my employer personally take on such trivial cases.
and patience happens to be one of my greatest strengths. so now, do you understand what you must give up, miss samuel? or should i address you as
do all you can to suppress them and fence them in!
legend has it that when his followers got lost in the desert, al-ahmar would command the underground rivers to rise to the surface, forming lakes for the trapped to quench their thirst
good answer! the tournament is about to begin, so i must go carry out the mission that grandpa gave me.
xilonen is working on the last part of your ancient name. it's best not to bother her when she's in the zone.
as a cloud knight, i can't just sit back and do nothing when i see civil unrest. and for your information, my name isn't "little miss feisty" -- it's sushang!
looks like yinshu isn't here after all where could she be?
ningguang commissioned an expert to dismantle and study the guizhong ballista, and design an improved version based on the original.
so reckless according to the rules of the silvermane guards, any expedition into the fragmentum must have a squad of at least four members, as well as a communications officer.
my schedule is usually very tightly packed, and any extra time i can squeeze out is spent on preparing for the future.
don't worry. let me think again.
since you invited me and all sure.
but since you know about the stellaron and have stated that you want to help the luofu, i thought i should at least meet you in person
actions? ohhhh, i get you! another plate of delicious snacks, coming right up!
you remember rivet town? when the fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. we didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
if you're dizzy, sit and rest for a while.
he's in serious condition, be sure he gets immediate medical attention.
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
great, i'll take you up on that offer.
congratulations, kaveh! also, you'll need to prepare for the award ceremony
we made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the lantern rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
this is what trailblazing is.
honestly, i feel that girl is hiding something from me. i knew cocolia well, and she was never one to suddenly change her mind.
looks like things blew up real quick everyone's flocked here to see what's going on.
i certainly would, in the past.
i'll see you next time -- you'll invite me back, right?
if you're really so desperate for the ipc to take over penacony blowing up the chessboard isn't a bad idea. start from scratch! that's where the ipc excels, right?
that brief window of sight that i regained has turned into a perpetual source of anguish -- forever etched into my mind
my other senses make up for that fact to some extent -- they're as strong as anyone else's.
you also can't forget to keep your guard up in case of troublemakers
but tell me, why should this concern me? why should i do this for you, when i already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
but without a doubt she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. it's like aventurine said just then. it's best to keep your distance from her.
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
what you mean to say is that you were targeting someone else, then. well, who was it?
i don't think i could repeat what i did a second time.
really? so my guess was correct.
i just hope everything is smooth-sailing from now on -- please look after me.
don't worry about me. staying focused under pressure for as long as it takes is my specialty.
look, miss himeko: i brought the kid back as promised.
you mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. otherwise you will be cursed with bad luck.
too ordinary! hmph, such an uninspired dish will never have my approval!
so, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? clearly, the musou no hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
might i remind you that i am not here to amuse myself.
just recently, the akademiya lost something and there's a chance the item is connected with the dendro archon. this case might just somehow help you in meeting her.
like i told you. that guy barely leaves his nest -- it's rare to see him away from the furnace core. even when he does appear, he doesn't stick around for long. he leaves everything to his subordinates.
the king remains still, and says nothing. the minister is the one who speaks.
he was like a teacher and a father to you, but you chose to repay that by poisoning him whatever positive goal you may have started out with, you threw it away in that moment.
and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
as memories are carried in the city breeze, the faults of such grievances are passed on from one generation to the next. it is now my turn to bear this burden.
ah, got it. so, you're the participant attending the wardance on behalf of the yaoqing, and you were trying to sneak a peek at our training?
could it be some competitors working on other films?
i'm not accustomed to expressing myself, but i consider myself a good listener. if you have any troubles, come find me. i'll guard your secrets.
if you had informed me sooner, there'd be plenty of room for us to
hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and ei! are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
that's more like it! as expected, my dazzling side comes through in any situation.
hmph. then i will come again once your preparation is complete. i have time.
he called the dragon something earlier. it sounded like he said
well, either way, i will do my best to remain vigilant.
but don't be mistaken, i'm not doing this out of the kindness of my heart like collei. my job is purely to monitor and ensure that lessig doesn't cause any more trouble here.
cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge -- that the truth will spread far and wide: to save the world, we must risk it all.
one folktale even claims that the ancients found the stove god's shrine, but there was no statue aeur" only a huge, smooth slab of stone.
march seventh and i could already tell. it's clear that every cloud knight soldier we've met on the skysplitter is an elite warrior.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
i have no questions about the case, but i'm just curious how did sparkle manipulate you?
still, now's a good time to make our next move. now that rahman's joined us, we'll be an even stronger team.
but i'll redeem myself this time! i'll make sure to protect her-- uh, and also keep an eye on her
she summoned me last night to tell me that you had deceived her. your identities and purpose here are counterfeit. you seek to overthrow the rule of the architects.
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that
alright, i was only joking, i didn't mean to chastise anyone. there's really no need to take all this so seriously aeur" if anything, i'm gonna feel awkward if we keep this going, hehe.
you mean here? uh, i can't think of anything in particular
or at least good enough to boost the morale and the strength of our troops like our grand master does
thank you for your concern, dear. but, believe me, i am quite comfortable wherever i go.
well, i mean, he's sitting in a jail cell. like yanfei says, everyone who breaks the law has to pay the price.
even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
mister sharif believes that interpersonal relationships are a byproduct of working towards a goal. once that goal is achieved or abandoned, those relationships would have no more reason to continue.
huh? is his past really that dark?
(besides, i'm an open book. it's not like you're gonna hear anything embarrassing oh, um, unless i've had a few drinks.)
that's where the sanctification of tao du comes in! the eight adepts rose up to solve the crisis, and laid down a great magic array to purify tao du.
i had some spare time, so i decided to come out for a stroll. oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
it was nothing special, really. geovishaps don't understand the concept of a "pet." so, basically, it just headbutted me whenever i entered its territory.
*sigh* sometimes i practice over a dozen times before reporting to my superiors, but i still can't get it right
but since we're already here, they could use our help.
because no matter where i've gone, i've always been surrounded by incredible kindness.
unfortunately, that is something i can neither confirm nor deny.
really, paimon. it's not like you don't know me. do i look like i know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
huh? why don't you respond? according to the custom, i must wait until you kneel completely before i can say the next words.
so i am afraid i can't help you.
i wonder what's in there. here, let me open it
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
isn't it just like cooking food over an open flame? if the house is a pot, then the heater is the stove it rests on.
but you've been really looking forward to this. i don't want you to have any regrets
also, it's not all bad. i might even beat you at arm wrestling now.
a debate? hmm well, scholars do love to use them to solve their problems, but how would that work in this case?
let's press on. we can't activate either of these terminals, so let's look for the energy supply installation itself.
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
well, the competition for survival went two ways -- shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom, and failure to take proper precautions cost many a hunter their life.
good luck! just remember, don't get knocked or launched into the air. that would be most inelegant.
the conditions here are so rudimentary. i wonder how long those people have been living here
but before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.
ah so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
don't worry about it. like they told me after announcing my name during the curtain call aeur" everyone's work deserves recognition.
i must have been chosen from among the children here and then taken to the surface
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
i don't think killing stormterror is the right course of action.
all i mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: you have to combine it with another print.
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
just stop whining. at least you're in one piece, right?
things are much more serious this time for two days now, huge clashes have been breaking out between the miners and the vagrants. it isn't pretty.
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
i have recently received multiple reports from the knights of someone within the lawrence clan having close dealings with the fatui.
ah, um but i'm completely unprepared
okay, well that's all from me. zhiyi, you'll have some preparation to do. it won't be long before you're informed of your official appointment. i hope you will work hard and make uncle tian proud.
we were just talking about her, as it happens. little layla told me that haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. but after you met layla, she very abruptly left.
i almost feel bad for him. aurum alley's enemy should be the ipc, not the president.
i'll go have a look around. traveler, please go take a rest in qingce village.
the ten-lords commission has specially entrusted judge huohuo with commanding the ghost-hunting squad, so please make sure to follow her lead in all matters related to the heliobi.
yes, but why?
if it were me i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
i'm convinced that what the witnesses saw was actually the fatui coercing him, or perhaps trying to extract information.
all i remember is that this is a good place to while away the days~ still, many delves have changed beyond recognition since the arrival of the stellaron.
let's do this. i may never have come face to face with it, but this stellaron cost me a nice, stable job. it's time to get even.
good! that's smart of you. but you needn't worry, cocolia and i aren't even on speaking terms. it was her that ejected me from the architects -- i refuse to stand with her.
uhh there's still one more round to go. would he really go to a tavern in the middle of the competition?
i've finished extracting that chip from the small robot. now all that's left to do is move all of this circuitry into the new shell
if alhaitham and cyno's sources are solid, then we can be sure that tighnari still has the akademiya's trust.
i can't believe you ended up back here on the skysplitter after running around all over the place. but, you're too late to enter the tournament now.
exactly right. the suspect is extremely cunning. she encrypted her transmission and timed her communication -- we couldn't pinpoint her exact location.
aw, thanks, but i'm just your average artisan. the quiet life suits me better.
forty% sixty-five% eighty-five%
the master diviner has a harsh tone, but she speaks sense. to be completely honest, her lectures are quite memorable
stop wasting our time. every one of us here is perfectly aware of what he had done.
aren't there other crew members we can take inspiration from?
xianzhou natives are more afraid of immortality than they are of the days coming to an end.
if you would excuse me, i should return to my work now. good luck.
if i may be so bold to ask, is this borisin truly that formidable?
your first priority is to prove yourself innocent, after all. i'm sure there is little that needs to be kept secret now unless your "script" already has holes in it.
people with big dreams have big determination.
i'll help you. my knowledge on the lord of the night and the wayob might come in handy.
i really like being with you. i don't know why, but it feels like a butterfly is trying to burst out of my chest anyway, how about i show a new dance to you?
on behalf of the sky-faring commission, allow me to welcome you to starskiff haven.
i suggest that you act just before sunrise, while most people are tired and resting. you may find some important leads.
i'd be perfectly happy with that aeur" i'm just worried that captain beidou's business might be negatively affected.
don't worry about it, my lady. just some friendly banter between mercs. one punch and those rabid dogs will expose themselves for what they really are.
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide this kind of work was made for him.
she is the one that's been causing our forces so much trouble. the fact the resistance has even held out for this long is thanks to her.
the artisanship commission is full of workshops, buildings, state-of-the-art mechanisms, and craftsmen designing brand-new concepts.
there were some very valuable images on that film, and we hadn't gotten around to making a backup i must admit, the thieves chose a good target, and they were fast and efficient.
is everything in order? if so, we need to meet up with lords phainon and mydei.
additionally, the fact that the borisin need medicine to disguise themselves suggests that there are still moles within the alchemy commission assisting them covertly.
hey, seeing as there's nothing on your plate just now, wanna help me fix up this machine? just a bit of manual labor -- you might find it interesting.
in short, if everything goes according to plan, they may yet prove to be helpful.
ah, it looks like the entire delegation from the xianzhou yaoqing has gathered at the alchemy commission. why don't we go see general feixiao and bring her some fruit?
i wouldn't be where i am now. i wouldn't have known that they respond to wishes, and i wouldn't have seen all these beautiful sights in sumeru.
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching
there are ipc advertisements everywhere. it's about time i got in touch with their trade commissioner.
human beings don't have powers like us youkai. it's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
i suppose it can't be helped. i'll send the wounded back to inazuma city and dispatch an elite force here. you've already been a great help, please return to the city with us.
she also appears to be standing right behind you.
i wonder if you've ever heard of a creature called a "heliobus"? it loves to feed on human emotions and memories, and excels at manipulating its hosts.
the spirit water shall show you amphoreus' distant and recent past.
when the swarm disaster began to take hold, tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple aeons.
i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go
but now, with hoolay's whereabouts unknown, everything is filled with uncertainty.
naturally, they would also regard ningguang's locking down the area, questioning the citizenry, and pursuit of the assassin to be pointless work. perhaps they even wonder if there might be a cover-up.
i'm wondering though, are there any restrictions against, uh "aliens" like me from boarding the train?
sometimes, you have to strike hard and fast at just the right moment to expose the lies while avoiding any unwanted interference.
huh? i wouldn't go that far -- i only had dad to deal with. he could be fierce, but nothing like the monsters here.
if all i wanted to do was make some quick mora by exploiting their blind faith in me, i have a million more effective ways of achieving that than hosting an auction.
yeah, don't sweat it. the eremites' reputation is gonna get even worse if these scumbags succeed.
after you left, yaoyao and shuyu tired themselves out playing with their kites.
so are judges all loners? you don't seem to have any backup.
okay, i'm done. i also left her a note so that she knows where to find us. we won't miss her again.
fate has brought us together -- that makes us friends! i often perform at exalting sanctum, so if you've ever got time, come and enjoy the show!
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. come on, off we go.
they're the ones who accept ena's dream and indulge in their happy illusions...
thanks, but no. i want something to help keep me awake.
however, the meat was so good that i ate too much and got a stomach ache, so i couldn't properly enjoy the wine
if you're interested, miss charlotte, i have several books on the topic that i could lend you. they could be a useful reference.
such is the herta company culture
we've helped pascal find compatible hardware. if we can eliminate the muddled information without damaging the sectors linked to his emotional intelligence
the view here is wonderful. it smells of the rainforest here, and we're far enough away that no one will bother us.
up till now, the almighty shogun had my full support. but now that she's been eliminated from the tournament in truth, i don't really care.
is this "jeroney" you mentioned one of your brothers?
huh? i wonder why? when we split up, she said she was heading home.
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
but since the three commissions work together to serve the shogun, they have a close relationship. someone from one of the other commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to
hehe, please just disregard my presence. now, tell us what you discussed.
this may be an everyday occurrence for you. but for me, this trip has been quite an occasion.
your ability never ceases to surprise me
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
geez, and there i was pouring my heart out now i feel like this kid's lived longer than i have
but you're quite right: trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
i honestly never thought that all of us would end up here
the people we met along the way are probably workers from the toytanium mines, or guards who came here to claim the dragon's head durin probably allowed them to live here because there was nowhere else for them to go
wakening which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
it's true that i've witnessed thousands of years of liyue harbor's history. all the changes it's gone through, the stories of its people
this shrine looks somewhat familiar.
everyone rose to their responsibilities. and i finally regained my freedom
you've already put on quite the show -- do you think you'll be able to find and operate the control panel? should be simple, right?
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
there are no permanent allies or everlasting enemies. so, let's both take what we need from this deal.
this is not good. everyone, we must hurry.
i'm just curious -- now things have come to this, is the family still unwilling to fight? i mean, your darling sister's already a goner, right?
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
you sense it too, don't you collei? something's not quite right.
there must be some robot shells lying around the machine graveyard. everyone calls it a graveyard, but there are actually lots of useful parts buried there.
to that point, as you know, the prototype of the jade chamber chess piece has been in the works for a long time, but i haven't once followed up on the progress.
in fact, we were just talking about you
on the other hand, the entire crew of the astral express seems to be extraordinarily skilled.
hmm that's strange
hey, lynxy! come and have a look at this!
well, you can still sign up. the cloud knights' ring is always open to outsiders.
you're thinking that there's not a huge difference between me turning these children into my informants and the actions of those two businessmen. am i right?
you've helped me so much already. how do i even begin to thank you
this vein so this is what everyone is fighting over
--seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. with you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
you're saying that the ipc is in it for the ipc, but we just want what's best for aurum alley
haha, thank you. make sure you look after me now~
so you believe that this universe is free?
hmm i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
don't blame yourself. the criminal is the one responsible here. the important thing now is to devise a plan to bring him to justice as swiftly as possible.
in the art of healing, i certainly could not compare to the luofu's high elder. but in these games of politics, i still take pride in being able to protect her.
this qian ketong person should be sparkle's targeted victim this time around.
actually, today's a little different. i'm not here to buy anything. i wanted to ask if you could take a look at some goods for me.
because of the difficult situation we were in, we formed a temporary alliance to help the residents of the underworld resolve a few issues of survival.
not at all. i was actually just about to go find you.
but is this nation worth existing for eternity?
you want to save the people of inazuma from the vision hunt decree. so do i. the only difference is that i'd rather like to save this nation and save ei while we're at it.
no, the disaster is over, but my dreams never lie
the only thing worth saying is: old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
oh, by the way, everyone's really thankful to you for helping out with the debate.
you already know its story, so i won't go into too much detail. my main reason for being here is merely to witness your decision.
i'll fight it to the end. no matter what.
the preparations were very lengthy this time. i don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but i, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.
but there are some things i find difficult to forget. i feel it's only right that i tell you what's on my mind before we part ways.
given the present circumstances, the cloud knight garrison probably isn't a safe destination, wouldn't you say?
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
i was just strolling nearby when i noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
i'm sorry for what happened... i was too focused on that girl, and got sloppy...
but you, little one. just a quick fight and this will all be over.
sky minks fly so nimbly and are so alert that even the quickest of hands will have a hard time catching them.
by continuing with our investigation, and reserving judgment for now.
even if you wish for it... i can't promise you anything.
miss hu tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
you have a strong sense of belonging here i guess i'm the opposite. mercs are stray dogs wherever they go.
perhaps it has its own set of authorization mechanisms, and only those it recognizes are permitted to sit on it.
i think you should wait outside. you've already been corrupted by the devorator once. it could easily re-enter your mind and take control of your body.
they're not foxians at all. they revealed their true form. they're borisin, just like the bandits i defeated on the ipc ship.
but, how we can get him to do that showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
let's say the sages didn't replace it every day. shouldn't it be hacked to pieces by now?
then we need to get moving. the longer they have to react, the fewer clues they'll leave behind.
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
it's been over a decade since the silvermane guards withdrew from the underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. the only contact we have is the exchange of geomarrow for goods.
here's my little partner in crime. souka named it "blitzara" aeur" i think it's rather good. very distinctive.
or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
the luofu's plaguemark is a tree, while the yaoqing's is a moon. ha, i think we got the better one.
very well. it's been some time since we've last shared a meal together.
well when i arrived here yesterday, grandpa almond told me all about the state of this world. since they think of me as their forest fairy, i just felt like i had to try to help them.
what's the rush, chicken wing boy? did i get to you?
easy now, layla. all that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. the bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
i had surmised as much. i knew you wouldn't have avoided mentioning the bird for no reason.
did he tell you that he suggested that i come work at the akademiya?
all in all, he was only here for half a day. i'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation
i see well, thank you for being sincere. in itself, it's a comfort to me.
but do you still remember? i said "i have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
enough. both of you. the festive spirit is turning you into giddy little children.
madam yukong! after thirty years, we find ourselves fighting side-by-side once more!
technically, amber and i are on a "vacation schedule."
wonderful. then i'll see you in three days. i look forward to it very much.
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
i have something else for you also: an aether expansion chip. integrating its data into an aether spirit will grant them new, innate abilities.
this scenario was relatively simple. in the face of a real battle, one would seldom have a chance to stop and evaluate the situation.
how do i put this you're no match for her at all.
ah, speaking of which actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
and before you say anything, there will be a next time. i know we'll meet again.
can you identify the people who left these footprints?
even inayah wants to stay with us, and she's starting to look forward to a new future.
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
uh thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
you're awake, lazy bug. looks like you had a nice dream.
this new age started after that great battle, you know.
i received some intel just earlier today. someone said they found clues related to a gang of thieves in the underworld's robot settlement. i don't know if they'll lead us to the sculpture, but it's worth a try.
the desert is unforgiving, so the way of life here is also a lot tougher than on the other side of the wall. you survive on making connections out here.
at that time, i dreamed that one day the jade chamber's shadow would be seen in all seven nations of teyvat.
no, we shouldn't do what they expect us to. they've been manipulating us from fyxestroll garden all along. we need to find out what they really want before we go any further.
plus, he was on guard. he knew i would try to go after him, so he made sure to keep his distance. i kept an eye out for a good opportunity, but it never came.
remember, all we need are some wide zoom shots of the streets. if you happen to find some particularly lovely patches of flowers and grass, feel free to grab some close-ups of those as well.
and yet, despite this, i thought it could do no harm to ask the question, on the off chance that you are interested.
gepard, look! the miners have put up a makeshift defensive line!
is this order really correct? lemme see
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
ahaa~ you just wanna spend as much time as possible with me before i go, right?
so, you're planning to
tell me this. why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? why now?
it's not that i "know everything." it's just that i've been in your position before.
that's fine. we can try a different approach. you'll be glad to know that bath sprites have mastered the art of catering to the needs of others.
that won't be necessary, mister bolai. wanyou boutique's credit is not sufficient to accept orders directly from yuehai pavilion.
i understand -- i'm scared too! i'm sure you'll find your courage sooner or later. i'll be here waiting for you when you do!
from now on, let's fight together.
as someone who sought to hurt others for his own gain, florian lost that right long ago.
and you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. hehehe
yes. you were the person who came to mind. we may not have spent a great deal of time together but i do place a great deal of trust in you.
ah, paimon and the traveler. i've been waiting for you.
how fascinating you must be full of secrets. there's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
even though the protagonist refuses to acknowledge his innate talents, he has a rare dedication to justice.
i saw the two inazumans leave with yanfei, heading towards liyue harbor.
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
is there a particular topic that you wish to discuss?
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
we should've already rescued our archon.
but she was hanging out with some other rtawahist students, so we didn't get a chance with speak with her. are you gonna go and see where she's up to?
but thank you for your encouraging words. i'll do my best!
i'm lead researcher of herta space station. but honestly... i'm more like madam herta's "housekeeper" of this place.
yes aeur" i've put a lot of thought into it.
*sigh* another half day gone, and nothing to show for it
well, if we can't see anything, that means we can't fight to the fullest of our abilities. should we retreat for now?
as you investigate the mound, you discover that the exposed portion appears to be made of wood. it was previously obscured by the large form of the monsters.
please check all your belongings, everyone, and make sure you haven't forgotten anything. once you're ready, please follow me to the designated location.
um so, silent but deadly, let me know when you're ready and we can set off.
no thanks. i'd prefer not to open it if only something terrible awaits. if anyone's going to find a way through, it's not going to be me.
a warm reminder, benefactors, that the artisanship commission is as important to the xianzhou as the divination commission.
just be sure to take care of yourselves out there. we'll meet again at the sabzeruz festival.
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
what? now that you have the real robin, i'm useless? oh, how disheartening! i've done so much for the family.
i didn't mean you had to be so formal about it. i need your actions, not your words, hehe.
that's enough fuss for today. you two, take him away. the honorary knight and i have other matters to attend to.
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
what? you want to secretly practice swordplay by yourself? dream on.
according to oleg, he's a robot that took part in the war of defense over seven hundred years ago. he possesses a near-human intelligence, and rules over all the machinery in the underground
xiangling is a highly accomplished chef, and her "assistant" is more like family to her.
clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
stay close, no going off on your own. the desert doesn't take prisoners.
i know that... i just never expected to hear you say it.
wow, the general recognizes me? i didn't realize i was so famous!
don't tell me this one is broken too!?
the name's serval. i'm, uh an ex-engineer from the technology division and gepard's sister. pleasure to meet you, chief!
miss march took me to her room just now. it was quite cozy. i liked it very much.
thank you for your constant kind words and comfort, traveler.
there's no need to take such great pains. if you just want confirmation i've already told you the answer, miss sparkle.
king navia is right. we cannot simply stand by and watch as the people of this world suffer.
the essence of turn-based games lies in the numbers, so you'd better get ready to witness the precision of my calculations!
oh, speaking of which, may i ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
(think about it long and hard)
uh, we're still lacking a pillow in here. although someone who can sleep comfortably on a cardboard box probably doesn't need one
*sigh* we still don't have anywhere near enough.
after all these years, i never thought i'd set eyes on this guitar again. *sigh* guess we're stuck with each other
"on this marvelous lantern rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
the knights perform our duty precisely so that the city's residents may live in peace.
then, the holy city shall also uncover their hiding place and sound the horn of retaliation.
i invited you here to gain a better understanding of the express, not bore you with these trivialities.
we will meet again, friend. no matter where your journey leads, the gates of okhema will forever be open to heroes.
ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? sure, i'll take one.
of course i missed you! the galaxy felt smaller without you in my cockpit
i will. thank you for your invitation.
look -- "exalting sanctum" -- this is a safe place. let's just walk the rest of the way from here.
the place you are going to is called rivet town. follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
that smells so, so good! where is it coming from? is it coming from the kitchen on the express?
anyway, beidou is currently in the guyun stone forest area.
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
who's this old guy with a white beard?
i understand, but i'm afraid it won't be an easy task.
alright, alright, let's save the awards speech for later, and hopefully also get some rehearsals in before the real thing.
i have high hopes for this journey!
you know, i'm serious about this. what if you guys run into something that you can't handle? i'll be your nifty on-call assistant!
so you're the general's cook?
i hear the anglers here sometimes sell their fish to the nearby fishmongers. hmm, let's see what uncle sun has to say.
yeah, anyone could see that. i just wanted to hear you say it again.
we came here to save lives. one arm for that many people is still a pretty good deal if you ask me. rahman, i'm holding up my end of the deal here. you'd better not let me down.
who are you? i don't remember you.
i never thought that the underworld would sink into such ruin without the silvermane guards perhaps mother was wrong
the situation is critical. we cannot delay any longer!
these millelith are just here to guard the scene, not to arrest anyone.
right. but i don't think pascal will give us a straightforward answer on this one
i did, yes. you're paying, after all.
you have many good qualities, collei. i bet if you had to learn dance since childhood like myself, then you'd be an even better dancer than me.
i've never spoken to the general, but i did meet his retainer once. he asked me if i was a "woman of the sword," so you know what i did? i did a sword-swallowing performance right in front of him!
then explain the purpose of the "evil sorcerer" in your story.
but won't you have regrets if things just come to an abrupt end? it'd be like when you were forced to stop adventuring
i just stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
did you by any chance hear a voice speaking to you before you got here, miss kirara?
well, i do have to admit, your success is remarkable.
that won't do! you've exposed your shortcomings.
now that we have awoken from our dream, we must learn to say farewell.
it's nothing urgent, really, just some trivial matters. but i wish to get it done as soon as possible
corruption and madness are lurking behind these anomalies. i must deal with them myself to prevent further troubles.
there are lots of goods around here. let's search the area, maybe we'll be able to find something.
in accordance with my wishes, the shogun did her best to create an eternal nation. a nation that, in theory, should remain entirely unchanged over time.
well would you believe me if i said yes?
fear not, unless i wipe away your memories, forgetting me is not an option~
if you're not too tired, gepard, can i talk to you for a moment?
good morning. xavier said yesterday afternoon went well?
let's work together to give them the surprise of their lives.
i, bronya rand, the nineteenth guardian of belobog, hereby take my oath
since mister luka is really popular, he'll definitely clear the popularity revival vote and return! please cheer him on!
come on, take it. this is the story of you and me. it's a tale that i'll never, ever forget.
things may look fine only on the surface.
hey! you're being too loud if the culprit is nearby, he'll just run away!
besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! anyway, give it some thought.
but i guess you do have a point we haven't uncovered the whole truth yet. we still need to figure out his exact actions and reasoning for these last few years.
*sigh* you never asked what the sky-faring commission does. i suppose not all commissions are created equal
strange, i never would have guessed that such a gifted chef worked here. this inn isn't particularly known for its food.
hehe, don't be nervous. just follow your heart's desire.
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
bye-bye now. come again soon.
i just told him about xbalanque's imminent return, and told him to be prepared. there was no need to mention anything else.
no, this is a borisin in disguise. a guard killed him before he could return to his original form.
still, it'd be nice if those kids would stop littering it's barely lunchtime and i've already picked up three half-eaten packs of snow-white popping candy.
(right, i need to keep calm, but he)
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
yes. any recommendations?
i think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
all those years of arguments and misunderstandings can't be settled overnight. it might be best if they continue to keep some distance for now.
since i was a kid, it's been clear to me that not everyone deserves to have a weapon in their hands. giving them a sword is no different than being cruel to the innocent.
it's not that i don't want to. it's just that i can't... i've come so far, and i can't sum up all of that in just a few words.
my name is tingyun, the amicassador for the luofu sky-faring commission merchant guild. please look after me from now on, benefactor.
(no, there should be something else that's more relevant.)
that's right -- we can't really know what a heliobus is thinking, right? tail was sealed away for ages and then suddenly let free if it were me, i'd want some away time.
i need to go home to fetch my grandfather's notes. let's meet at wanmin restaurant later.
sure, go ahead and summon the whole team, fourth mirror.
waeur"well. your denial is very strident, i'll give you that! but what proof do you have to back your claims?
now, let's proceed upward!
speaking of living in the shadows, there's probably not much difference between us. it's only polite to reveal your true self, at least when speaking to others...
i know, right? thanks to march seventh skipping class, we get to join in on the fun.
and yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
also, i believe that there is no such thing as a wiser or more enlightening performance.
or perhaps the ley lines did not have the power to sustain him for very long. as was the case with the memory we saw earlier.
barbara and lisa have both spoken to me, and there is something that i have realized. regardless if i approve it or not, klee will go where she wants to anyway. this is how it has always been.
well, how could they expect to attract people to come and watch if they didn't make a huge spectacle? march, you haven't forgotten what you came to do, have you?
yes, though it is something very precious to one of my informants. it reminds her of her mother.
thank the dendro archon for dunyarzad! with the mora she gave us, we hired someone to patch up the tree, and we also gave the stage a much-needed makeover.
i have a question for you, miss chevreuse. would you be willing to play the role of a musketeer?
you seek to crush human nature underfoot while masquerading as an as an arbiter and a god! i cannot let you!
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
i'm not the best judge of things but these mirrors
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know
uh not the kind of waves that drown everyone, i mean the good kind of waves
i thought the general's retainers were all burly martial masters. i didn't expect yanqing to be so
alright, but there are doors all over the place which one should we choose? do you have any idea, misha?
the information held in the ley lines is complex and disorderly. the fact that we were able to meet him to begin with was a miracle of fate
well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know i'm actually working to take care of it.
i honestly have no idea
done spacing out, ororon? did you finish your homework?
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
none. no one has seen the devotee of eternity since she shut herself away. in fact, no one even knows what it looks like in there.
my mother always told me that as long as i honed my skills, i'd be able to deal with any situation seems i've still got honing to do.
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
this place will do. we can hide here while we keep an eye on the boat.
let's leave that until we get to yuehai pavilion.
um well, i'd get them to the shore, and then i'd probably hide behind a tree and watch them for a while
anyway, the real issue is that dakan al-ahmar is led by my father, kusayla.
sure, when you're not passed out in fear! hehe
regardless of your choice, the chrysos heirs will continue to follow the path in the prophecy.
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
yanqing, the wolf you are hunting is standing above us in the wardance ring at this very moment, facing the cloud knights
it's nice to see you all again, astral express crew. i heard my disappearance caused quite the commotion out there i'm really sorry about that.
of course not! it's hard to find someone in mondstadt that attracts contempt as much as she does.
still, i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
it was a fair match, so no one's to blame. actually, we should be grateful to you -- they were so impressed by your abilities that they said they want to train harder.
with one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. i hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes they must have come through here.
but a peaceful society will probably mean less demand for mercenaries like me. before long, we'll be a dying breed, so i'd better get to work while i still can.
my audience likes getting to the bottom of mysteries, secrets, and conspiracies we streamers have to cater to that, you know?
this is my first time commentating for such a competition. i'm feeling kinda nervous.
you say these things in the hope that we will understand and accept them. but if you don't even know that your self-sacrifice is going to pay off, all you're doing is hurting morale.
garvipidam, perhaps you should see what your friend sent you in the package.
it's a little bit forced, but it's fine. so who is this mister sampo, then?
look, everyone. isn't this the dango milk we are searching for?
mavuika already told you about her plan, and you've given so much help to ororon and me you deserved to learn the full truth.
then, please help us pass on my request. i've never participated in a debate, and truth be told, i'm still not really confident in myself.
c'mon, i'll lead the way. once we're done watching the meteor shower, i'll accompany you home.
oh, don't worry. i've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
something like that, yeah.
see, i told you it wasn't going to be that simple. where is this?
who would have imagined that i would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? no, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
the grand notion of eternity she once held has long since given way to the eternity of her own definition.
a friend of yours? oh, so she must be the one you were telling me about
oh, yes. i was going to help some of the other residents of the forest. they've been busy making preparations to reopen the tavern, so i thought i could help out.
i heard that the adventurers' guild did once receive a commission related to siltwater lakes.
it appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
mister svarog's warnings about the potential risks do make me nervous.
oh, also aeur" hey guys! it's been a while!
no, it's still worth exploring. i'll go and take a look first.
why does it feel like he's using his praise for me as an excuse to brag about himself?
we could come knocking on their door on the grounds of a search warrant, but if the investigation were to come up empty, i'm afraid tensions and distrust would only increase.
it's really nothing that exciting.
thaeur"this doesn't look weird, does it?
that's right! an empty ink bottle, to be exact. still remember the taste of the "magic tonic" you took a sip of, paimon?
amber, you're being far too formal. the child is never going to remember all that.
umm, that depends on the higher-ups. if there are still civilians to evacuate, then i'll need to come back.
it was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. with regards to the annihilation gang i can also prove that what aventurine said was the truth.
i see but why aren't the other people around here scared?
well, no not yet, at least. i promised my lady that i'd stick around until next week.
don't let your past suffering keep you from the new life that you've worked so hard to find.
there's an accounting book lying on the ground. it must have been specially placed there by sparkle.
okay, fine, but only tonight. tomorrow's a big day, and many no-good scumbags are gonna take advantage of that.
the platform on the right is missing an iron ball
is that so? then thank you. the tenryou commission will take over from here. rest assured we will get to the bottom of the matter.
uh shenhe, and the conqueror of demons
we've still got work to do. let's keep going.
after a quick discussion, you nod to the guards and agree to follow. they lead you all the way to the audience hall of the palace.
not really, no. she was a military history major -- very different from what i was doing.
but if the treasure was all you cared about, why plant all those explosives? wouldn't they just destroy the treasure, and bury you along with it?
i apologize if this ritual upset you, but i hope you understand i had no other choice.
ah. you're saying that he wasn't
hehe. before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
march said something like that at first, too.
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
fine, show me your past.
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
you're injured. get some rest. everything else can wait.
also, i don't consider you a loner. oh, i don't mean him, but rather behind you
alright, so you want to do this the hard way.
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
but the dance of sabzeruz is one of the key parts of the sabzeruz festival. if we can't perform it
same as usual. my schedule normally isn't too packed, so i have plenty of time for myself.
so it's not that you wish upon shooting stars, but that wishes summon them?
next, find a suitable spot and try *walking up* the wall.
it was inevitable that their business would send them all to different corners of the world, and that they'd have far less opportunity to see each other in the future.
ah, don't worry. i just want to talk to them. i don't have any other intentions!
yeah! i heard some buzz about this special partner database on the astral express.
ah, looks like i'm the one who got distracted.
then the sages would have had to reproduce every mark i left during previous training sessions.
huh? ah i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
when you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret
but they're the ones getting besieged.
i believe that you two will come to an understanding once your journey is over.
it's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. it was once quite popular during festivals.
so, as long as the treacherous terrain here makes it harder for them to escape, the ten-lords commission doesn't have any complaints.
that's just the work of my subconscious mind
you want to create a situation where all three parties are present?
some are others are mad i always come out on top. a few decades like that, and people stop knowing how to deal with you.
yes, it's a possibility. that would explain why my memory of it is so blurry.
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
well, you did get nerfed after turning into a good guy so, i guess i'm okay, too!
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
perhaps, we can think of another way?
interesting, she's a member of the genius society alright.
over the years, the destruction's minions have wreaked havoc on countless worlds, and the alliance has been keeping an eye on them. but no one expected them to join hands with the remnants of the abundance.
madam faruzan here's pretty friendly aeur" when she heard that we were buying clothes, she decided to give us some help.
without a doubt, you aced it.
i'm grateful for your assistance. now, i will leave you here in peace to proceed with your work. i still have a few items from today's schedule that need addressing.
in order to quell the situation, chief oleg brought wildfire into the mine and left me in charge of security for the towns. but the situation in the mine is critical -- i have to back him up.
in that case, it's unanimous.
i had a patient who took some before a fight, only to realize that afterwards his lower body was missing
belobog is even smaller i can barely even see it from the express
which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
the scars of that war never truly healed. still, the luofu traced out its arc of recovery, and continued to trade
my bad. well, since you went through the entire ambrosial arbor crisis firsthand, dan heng and lieutenant yanqing, i'd like to discuss something with you.
i don't understand. you appear to be trying to save me, benefactor, but why are you telling me all this?
haha, that was actually a very good impression of cloud retainer, paimon.
to be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed" but we did escape.
i mean, i guess you could be trying to pursue your definition of the avant-garde if that's what you're doing, i suppose you do have to find yourselves a capable director
we were just about to discuss the boards over here. they're related to our little helpers' tasks, so i'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
and take it from me: if you two really do decide to visit port ormos, you'd best watch your backs. let's just say that the eremites there aren't nearly as friendly as those here in sumeru city.
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
i've never really seen this side of him before the more you learn.
then on to the next order of business -- let's discuss your companion, shall we?
i'm surprised anyone has the guts to try and pull off something like this during the extravaganza. just goes to show how tempting a fortune like sachin's is.
i'll hazard a guess that this is how you got that interview at the fortress of meropide.
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying
sometimes i record my daily experiences in a book that way when i see my sister, i can tell her about them.
typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
during the archon war, piles of corpses covered the wilderness. people were plunged into misery and suffering. disease was spreading all over the land. death devastated the world of the living.
fangs bared, then add a little red dye the more ghastly the expression, the better! interesting, very interesting!
lil' geppie so grown up now looking down on his civilian sister
one, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
now go and experience it for yourself. i will guide you in the simulated universe to make sure nothing happens to you! i'll even give you a substantial reward.
i can still hardly believe it. i'll use my own methods to locate tingyun's whereabouts, but at present i
r--really? we don't need to ask miss natasha first?
if we ever have the opportunity, i too would like to play a match with you.
it's got a small base, but it's stable enough to get the job done. i used to love stargazing with it when i was a child.
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
as such, i have been putting eyes and ears out ever since you reached liyue
but i've already told you.
but i'm still not sure which of them is our tail
you know me aeur" role-playing's one of my biggest strengths.
during the hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the grand narukami shrine. having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
samuel, nice name. so, what do you need, miss samuel? and what are you willing to give up in return?
it looks like he still has a place for her in his heart.
now, i want some answers. what were you planning to do with the stockpile of fireworks?
in my opinion, there are many people around with ulterior motives, making this a very risky business to enter into in the short term.
is that so looks like you're a bit hard to please. trusting and perceptive at the same time.
when i returned to inazuma, i was shocked to find that a great sakura tree had appeared on mt. yougou. the tree that you know as the sacred sakura.
why not come around today and help me with my research? you'll be the subject, by the way.
well, the qimen arts teach that the state of the ley lines is intricately linked to human activity. each can affect the other.
this is herta space station. as you might tell from its name, it belongs to the distinguished madam herta herself.
it might also have been because clara was here -- the little girl in red. she's best pals with svarog -- always following behind him.
the sights here are nothing like what i've seen at home. there are new wonders to be found with each step.
oh aeur" and i wish you a pleasant and enjoyable irodori festival.
all students from huitzilin's school of shamanism must pass an extremely difficult trial before graduation aeur" defeating me in battle.
allow me to introduce him to you: this is boothill, a galaxy ranger.
you're welcome, and there's no need to be so polite. you learned fast!
the awkward silence and weird expressions left quite the impression on 'em. they were originally interested in joining us, but after that, they both told me they were too uncomfortable to stick around.
i think i get what you're saying. you think none of this was a coincidence.
heh, so you would stick to mister lyney's defense even after knowing what you do now? you certainly have more professionalism than i thought.
but aren't you--?
you must understand the situation you are facing.
that was really risky behavior! if those grownups had woken up, things could have gotten really dangerous for you two.
um it's a little bitter and a little sour
and yes, things are going well for me too -- thanks for asking!
i hope the jade chamber will always float in the skies above liyue harbor, bearing witness to the prosperity and peace of the human world
you see? brothers and sisters need to have a scrap once in a while to get back on good terms.
i shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, onodera. please take the opportunity to have a good rest. after all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
mister zubayr said that you're one of us, so that means we will protect you.
that's right, i mean you, traveler. you'll support lyney, won't you? after all, he was the one who helped you the first time we met.
master left many things to me when she disappeared. there was the sword, an old key, and a good amount of junk she probably just didn't want to take with her.
my companion blade has been taken away by the cloud knights. i want to bring him back, resolve this stellaron crisis, and clear our names.
some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside bracelets and jewelry. we put the bigger ones into instruments of calculation so we can simulate the future and learn from the past.
centuries ago, an emanator of abundance besieged the luofu with the aim of taking the ambrosial arbor. they destroyed half our delves and killed most of the cloud knights.
a place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic so, that was the "turbulence" i was sensing.
eversummer was that always the name? seems i was too young to get the irony back then.
wow, you answered in a heartbeat!
belobog apologies, i'm not familiar with the name. regardless, welcome to the luofu. mister luka, are you here for a consultation?
never-changing eternity is the promise i made to my people.
everyone played their part, and thanks to everyone's efforts, the performance was a great success.
as one of the judges from the interrogation division, i'll be recording your testimony today.
perhaps some of you will have heard the news already. i am, in fact, planning to rebuild the jade chamber.
one of the ancient sorcerers of remuria used his power to assemble a formidable army of golems. he sought to use that force to establish himself as king.
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
changing our content would not only mean turning our backs on our vision, it would also directly lead to the loss of our livelihoods.
that's right! for us, any problem that can be solved by force isn't a problem at all.
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
the fatui are a problem not only for the knights aeur" they also present a real threat to the whole of mondstadt.
my brother said the restricted zone energy lines were malfunctioning -- told me it was urgent. he doesn't trust those contracted maintenance workers so he got me in for free.
hmph, yes, that's what i would be doing aeur" if i hadn't been interrupted by a certain someone's malicious scheming.
it's telling the truth mister svarog made a promise to me, and he never betrays his promises.
i didn't expect her to be so open-minded and she didn't even try to persuade me to stay. she didn't summon me just to return the guitar, did she?
yes this robot model probably doesn't have any kind of metal weapon.
no one likes regrets, myself included.
unfortunately, only one master is here. i'm doing fine.
how observant! you're right, i'm not a xianzhou native~
i'm sorry we have an understanding. i stand with them.
you see, every guest here is quite extraordinary. it's unbelievable that we got everyone to gather here almost like a fairy tale.
i just feel a bit empty now that we've lost the stellaron -- i spent a long time pursuing it, after all
for mortals, even if they possess the great power of a path, they can't create a flawless world like gods do.
in this iteration, the game master's version of the script is incomplete. the script manager provides the next part of the script only after players have completed the current list of objectives.
ahem all in all, i appreciate the effort.
she mentioned the cloud knights were at the alchemy commission -- i should find a ship and regroup with my unit. what about you?
that's why it's so important to develop close connections with your teammates.
he's been raising phlogiston aphids for a long time, and since they were disturbed, they secreted a special type of phlogiston. we can use that substance to track his movements.
mister reca is so amazing. he convinced the family so easily.
but i'm unwelcome in liyue harbor. as an adeptus, i
scrap metal, huh? the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
it really isn't worth going into.
there's no time. i'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the memory zone.
the sparkle murder case? wasn't the victim shamari from the ipc?
if someone starts getting under your skin, you just yell right back at 'em. if that doesn't put an end to it eh, then you just challenge 'em to a fight.
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
i'll say it again. i don't care what ruan mei said to you, but there's no chance we're shutting down the simulated universe!
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me"
go on, take them. i'll thank the stars for you later.
besides, the yae publishing house will need your help with the illustrations again next time, mister calx. you could also consider it as my investment in you.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
ahem ah, yes, ningguang and i have different scopes of work, you see, and ganyu has to report to both of us respectively. it's indeed not easy for her.
don't waste your time worrying about me aeur" this is my job. look out for yourself. after i've wiped the floor with them, i'll go find you all.
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
the akademiya looks down on performers like us. they probably think it would be best if the theater closed down completely.
yes, it does. i always thought that she must have grasped some elusive, arcane wisdom to arrive at the conclusions she did.
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
the tides come and go, but the ancient sea remains the same. for us vidyadhara, there's nothing more nostalgic than our homeland.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape
according to micah, they died long ago.
hmm, only problem is the view here isn't great. are you sure we'll be able to watch the aurora?
right, and that changes everything it could mean a powerful faction is trying to gain influence over the liyue qixing.
you have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
relax, i'm just joking. baishi probably made arrangements yesterday to add a few extra dishes to the breakfast menu.
if you want a contest, i'll be the referee. the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
his eyes are sincere, and his words ring true. you can tell that every word he spoke just now came from the bottom of his heart.
really!? then where is the real satelleden? will i have the chance to go see it with the express?
looks like it's over already.
i can't believe my own eyes either, but i know that sculpture inside and out.
hmm i don't know how to deal with people like that.
and maybe we are don't get too close, or you might turn into a ghost too.
it's your home, after all, you should be the one to shape it!
mm-hmm. we'll meet them formally soon. before that, let me run you through the assessment process.
don't you know how many sentry posts the family has built, and how hard it is to get you out of here?
can you see the express in boulder town? why does it fly in the sky? who is the conductor?
but why would the vidyadhara collude with the borisin and aid in hoolay's escape?
huh? you don't dream? ever?
sounds like you're speaking from experience
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
yes... yes, we will. but not yet. before the hunt, we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
a long time ago, there used to be a group of bandits in the liyue countryside who would sound a horn every time they were about to raid a village.
qingni! have you thanked your benefactors yet?
aha! well, at least one of you gets it!
really? you better not be making things up!
when that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
"against the scorching sun, a beautiful flower will never endure. within my fair embrace, my love for you is tender and pure."
come on, march! let's go find him!
i understand your concern. i'll be sure to give it further consideration.
(i thought i might stammer, but thankfully, i was able to convey my thoughts just fine. okay, and next)
i understand. thank you for your words of encouragement, mister khasani.
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
hmm "wander the world with them." it sounds like lady bailu would've been an ideal target -- she's always running off to play in aurum alley.
actually, some of the cloud knights use pellets which contain trace amounts of this ingredient. when you block pain on the battlefield, you have a better chance of beating your opponent and surviving.
the cloud knights are here -- i need you to help me get rid of them.
yeah? you could've gotten me to open it for you!
there are many types of people called "heroes," and he is among the most genuine... i have seen many such people come and go.
glad to hear it. these peace talks are quite exceptional. it is a major step forward both for watatsumi island and the shogunate.
we can put that aside for now. besides, if it's the acting grand master's assignment, and amber's the one who recommended me, i should comply.
everyone, i suggest that we stop here for a moment. we should take stock of our surroundings before deciding on our next course of action.
sorry, i got a bit distracted there.
i'm sorry, you two. i didn't mean to bring up any sad memories
if it would help shed any light on the situation, then please, be my guest.
by sending out coupons and gifts, we attracted twice as many customers as we normally would. this shows that food is still a big reason why people visit the alley.
wait. kaeya, if you're here, who is overseeing the knights of favonius?
i kindly request an immediate warp jump out of the asdana star system.
are we missing the forest for the trees here? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
oh, that's right! mister zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
miss black swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?
it sounds like you underestimated me. and the children, as well.
alright, then this is how i'll show up.
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
it was simply a new experience for me. one that is worth reliving.
hee-hee, we've also never made anything this complicated before.
you've made an exceptional contribution toward the building of the new jade chamber.
and that memory will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
our signatures are the grin-malkin cat and the bogglecat box. oh, and we'd need to add pers as well.
mm, looks like one of those memory bubbles. it's not worth that much attention. you'll find many more in the other zones.
she is a top xianzhou leader mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again?
mumbling?! i'm praying!
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter
yeah, have you seen engur, delavar, or jabari recently?
there was a huge shaking just now coming up through the ground. mister svarog said it must have been
so should we tell everyone the deal?
in an impressive display of courage, the four of you successfully defeat the uninvited guest.
totally used to it~ pela and i have already struck fear into the hearts of more than a few newbies.
it was because of both of you that qingni escaped unscathed. words cannot express my gratitude.
yes. glad to make your acquaintance, mister morris. we've heard about the issues you've encountered with your financial situation, and genuinely hope that things have taken a turn for the better.
i do not think that they'll strike again any time soon, so i shall stop following you. good day, all.
trying to break through would be risky. let's see if we can find another way.
with those annoying bugs squashed, we're done fixing the computing zone too.
no, thank you. i'm just wondering if you might know where the conqueror of demons is?
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
therefore, the only thing that i can do right now is to ensure that the both of you remain devoted.
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. time for anti-raiden shogun training phase two.
and should our feathers be damaged, then we share our wings with one another.
all of you have been busy with various preparations for the competition. today marks a perfect ending to this warrior's spirit event. your efforts have been recognized by the almighty shogun.
then the ipc would've been more brutal, and the situation would've been much harder for us thankfully, xiaohan turned out to be upright and reasonable.
but being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. we must make a decision, no matter what.
judging by the look on your face, i'm guessing you saw something a little unpleasant in there?
getting a move on already? i would've thought you'd at least wanna spend some time with that cartridge you were obsessing about.
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
since the battle, the shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
mister zubayr, our manager, always says that celebrations aren't just for fun, but that they should also be occasions for reflection and review
i see fine, i respect your choice. let's return to reality.
i was the one who vouched for him, so i need to report back to the speaker's chamber. i'll accept however they choose to handle the situation.
i didn't see anything wrong with her ways at the time, and, anyway, children don't get to choose how they're raised oh, she did bring me back a pet from liyue once. it was a geovishap hatchling.
however, unlike you stellaron hunters or the astral express, we band together merely to obtain what we want.
the footprints, which are half as big as standard, must belong to a pepeshi person.
err, maybe the corps of thirty just didn't have anyone available? or maybe someone recommended us? i've never given it too much thought
they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
their legacies shall continue to be passed down from generation to generation, as everlasting as the stone onto which their names are carved.
almost certainly from his master aeur" who was also my great-uncle. baizhu's master was my grandpa's younger brother, a former deputy director of wangsheng funeral parlor.
i've been in my fair share of treacherous battles. so i know full well that you never bring up extreme measures like this until the very, very end.
seriously? you're questioning me like this is a court case now. i don't know anything about that.
the moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
hmm, i must send her a gift. it's a good thing that i know what she likes.
thanks, franz. i'll put in a good word for you with my brother and get him to promote you!
partings are inevitable, of course, but distance makes the heart grow fonder, right?
when people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. sampo's first and second laws of motion.
open this door... take a look at the mesmerizing dreamscape, while you can still remember.
please forgive my lack of courtesy for receiving you in this fashion especially following such a long and wearisome journey over the sea.
i'll go play with gorou, instead. it's been a while since i've seen those fuzzy ears of his.
i'll try to think of something. we can't just let everyone suffer in a perpetual state of fear and uncertainty.
although she ran into misfortune, it led her down a new path in life. she sees that as a blessing.
i've never doubted the master's integrity, so i'm having a real hard time rationalizing how he could ever support an infamous brigade like them.
no, i came here to help my cloud knight coworkers get medication for their bruises and swelling.
in my opinion, you enjoy playing the role of a joker, spouting off outrageous opinions just to seem objective and indifferent whenever you feel like it.
i am not in the habit of resting at noon. but if you wish to do so, i will wait for you.
hmm? what's stopping you? not still traumatized from your last encounter, are you?
well done. your performance was most impressive.
but doesn't that mean everyone will die? i'm a fontainian just like them aeur" will i dissolve too?
agh, enough apologizing. my ears can't take any more.
if i had to choose my color, it would be the color of this handkerchief.
patience. since the news made it out a few days ago, i have already had many people contacting me to declare an interest in joining the project.
tea parties are a must for the well-mannered. if you'd like to learn the proper etiquette, i'd be happy to teach you.
the two of you may be just the "reinforcements" that the chrysos heirs have been waiting for.
(what does she mean, "onto something"? i certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
if it's okay with you, would you let me borrow the shinrou casket from the domain's core?
how deep a fully loaded vessel will sit in the water varies from ship to ship. but it's something you can tell from experience, at least for the kinds of vessels you see regularly.
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
that's settled then! there's no time to lose -- we should head out as soon as you're ready.
but the best-laid plans of snow mice and men often go awry they didn't realize the parts would interfere with the robots' systems and cause them to run amok.
like all the other cursed swords i'll separate it from the heliobus, then i'll melt it down and make it part of the "blade of forged remnants."
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
so essentially, you're gathering information to help you solve the riddles, correct? i'll do my best to help.
and now you get to stake a claim. hmph, you think you're stronger because you got to them first? ugh mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
the vision hunt decree is a trap. part of a fatui plot to bring inazuma to its knees.
it's your turn to ask a question. come see me when you're ready.
of course i don't. there is no need for commerce in the plane of euthymia. if i ever need something, i can simply have one of the commissions bring it to me.
here, these rewards are for you. i hope they come in handy on the journey ahead.
later, this puppet wandered inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until the fatui took an interest in him.
although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. to me, this says you like to take care of it.
well, i was really hoping you would say that such sacrifice could at least be used as some leverage in our negotiations.
suit yourself. worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is ei, so what's the big deal?
hmm, although kites are one of our most time-honored cultural relics, outside of their use in certain ceremonies, i suppose they're considered "playthings" more than anything now.
mm-hmm mm-hmm alright
dear benefactors, i extend my heartfelt gratitude to you.
you're like a broken record
i bet you've got nothing better on your mind!
those people are carrying bowls bowls full of beans. what's that all about?
i should've known don't quit your day job.
this sword in my hand naught but a needle compared with the heavenly bodies. how can i use it to cut open a star?
hehe i'm sure you're playing it down a little. koutoku and the others put you through your paces, i presume?
alas, why is your face turning pale, yanqing?
forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
i will see to it personally, you have nothing to worry about.
i stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
don't be upset, kaveh. sighing can carry away your good luck, you know.
the moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. it seems that as i go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
if only there was some kind of mysterious potion that could keep me awake forever i need to have a talk with lisa tomorrow.
several strange guards suddenly call out to you. they run forward to meet you and proceed to politely pay their respects.
i am the only one in all of inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
and it'll be thrilling! bang!
oh, how should i know! it's up to you, you have so many options to choose from. maybe jump out a hatch, or hop into the fragmentum and see if any monsters start worshiping you?
as you saw, qianwei is highly knowledgeable. he proposes many excellent ideas in his manifesto which effectively target the big issues.
that sounds, uh ambitious, i guess? anyway, this is all way beyond me.
oh? you have a good memory. let's go see what's wrong in that zone.
i give her the most boring things, and then she gives them back to me and they're suddenly interesting.
she was pretty shy at first, but i explained that i just arrived in sumeru and had gotten lost, so i needed someone to help guide me
no, oleg didn't assign that to me. but i've got a pretty good idea who it's gonna be.
don't let her carefree nature fool you -- she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
shanghua, visit all the commerce guilds and look into qianwei's background. wenyuan, go to the ministry of civil affairs and look through mingbo's work files.
i understand. please help reassure the people in the village and tell them everything's going to be fine with the millelith standing guard.
if you are in need of mora, you should absolutely consider doing business.
true. that's one reason why it's been difficult to catch on.
that's a question for the newcomers. but let's start with that worker over there for now.
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
before you came, i already had a look around i know it wasn't appropriate, but i just couldn't help myself.
is he your leader? i feel he possesses a great stillness of mind in everything he does.
this may sound embarrassing, because i would sometimes forget stuff i really shouldn't have from past experiences... it's just a habit of mine, don't mind me.
that chess piece i told you about aeur" we can start work now. i have the traveler's measurements here.
although this appointment breaks with convention, i firmly believe that with your wisdom, courage, and strength, you can lead your team to victory.
as in, disappear from the ley lines completely, never to be seen again aeur" taking the banished evil along with them.
what was that all about? you're one hundred% certain we're gonna find those robots for him?
it's like like a fight between two friends. if they don't agree to see each other and talk in person, isn't it possible that the friendship could end entirely?
utter disregard for human life. why would they want to hide it?
really? you're not kidding, are you?
it's not a big deal, dunn. y'know, if you get a chance, would you wanna get on stage with us again?
that is of no concern. this is my recuperation state.
take them. i have no need.
madam cocolia i am grateful to you for raising me, and for allowing me the privilege of choice.
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
eh? that's weird i pressed the button already. i wonder what went wrong
that healer seems to be a senior colleague of sushang's but i heard that he's even more energetic than she is! maybe everyone from the yaoqing is that way?
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know
don't try to cause a rift between us. every move and technique i taught march is straight from the zhuming art of swordplay.
how lamentable you are! please, bear with me for now. i vow to defeat evil ninja osaru and restore your ninja forms.
there's no need to worry, though. i'm preparing for a public debate with the akademiya.
it appears they may be the thief's accomplices. they were probably hiding here to wait for the stolen goods.
i would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
well, that's because
i was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. it seems she was quite frightened, too.
if it were up to me i'd probably agree to the ipc's conditions.
make sure you deliver the news to the outside world.
come on. let's go down to the docks.
since you've made it yourself, i guess having a little taste is the least i can do, haha
we would find the stellaron in a non-physical way?
give it a little push and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
ninja initiate gigaku, what ails you?
that's right. he was not only one of the six heroes, but also a legendary border master of our tribe. five hundred years on, and the remains of his spirit is still so strong
jokes cannot conceal your true intentions. opportunities are fleeting and you've just wasted one.
in principle, i should remain an outside observer. but you are far too much fun for that. i can't help but tease you from time to time.
moreover, how do you intend to reach the islands? without a safe and reliable plan drawn up, i'm afraid i cannot give you my approval.
why so surprised? you're still young and full of energy. i'm pretty sure you'll live a few more decades. have some confidence in yourself!
i still don't get it, though. didn't the astral express already depart some time ago? is that world so incredibly spectacular that it warrants this return trip?
but our audience isn't the akademiya aeur" it's the people of the grand bazaar.
i have a feeling you're going to let her off even more.
you must be tired after the walk back to shore. perhaps i should let you go first?
the homayanis also still post jobs from time to time. their pay is always generous, so me and the other mercs never pass them up.
i can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
oh, it's you. hello.
the duty of the silvermane guards is to serve the people. so, where can we find these robots? clara, can you lead the way?
we'll have to cut the banter short let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
we are putting our dearest baby sister in your hands this time. let us know immediately if anything happens.
no, it's just this place seems familiar somehow. never mind.
not so fast. even though we've cleared the theft allegations, we still haven't ascertained whether your arrival in inazuma was legal or not.
the sages have placed spies everywhere on the other side of the wall. i'll follow you as a bodyguard.
while there aren't any people in this mansion... they've set up quite a few memetic guards to patrol this place.
why? because i also want the wardance to go smoothly.
i have awaited your arrival with great anticipation, and thoma assures me that you do indeed possess the power to change the tide of the times.
haha, i have to admit, you definitely have that rock 'n' roll flair.
every day all i hear is "remember who you are, bronya," "this is against the architects' admonishments, bronya," "ladies shouldn't use such foul language, bronya"
first of all, zhiyi isn't much of a drinker. on some level, he hates alcohol because of what it did to his father.
i cannot stress enough how important it is to not let it escape.
being the master deceiver she was, the weasel easily earned cesar's trust. now all that remained was to frame him for her countless crimes.
if you don't spill whatever you're scheming against liyue
of course. behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
i'm a professional fighter. my martial school has always emphasized the importance of refined control.
why of course, but now's not the time.
it's unnecessary, as far as i'm concerned. but since you are inviting me a change of pace might well be nice.
i hope i won't meet member #four polka kakamond. that would be quite troublesome.
and trial two will be complete.
cut it out. i'm carrying out my sacred duty.
i've heard his name. a genius boy, and working every day at such a young age? sounds exhausting.
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return
you need money for your family, right? take this and show it to a knowledgeable buyer, and they'll instantly know how valuable it is.
come at us, mister luka! my team will show you the prowess of the cloud knights' formation!
no one gets left out of my stories!
tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me? with a one-on-one duel? or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
as the one who shook eternity, you are her potential for change.
i already have something in mind. let's pay sara a visit at good hunter.
don't worry about it. take a rest, we'll be back right away.
if i understood correctly, there are currently two problems in the kingdom that need solving, right?
rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. thunder is required.
your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
so, this nahida you mentioned what did she say?
recently, i learned something new calculation results can't always bring people happiness.
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
fortunately, i made advance arrangements for gerald to remain in a safe location and conduct some basic physical training exercises.
what's gotten into you? come on, sit yourselves down.
that i do not deny. however, final victory was always going to be ours, even had things been a little more arduous.
he doesn't look like the type, but that sounds about right.
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
after we split up, ayato went to see iudex neuvillette at the palais mermonia.
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
in any case, i don't suppose you came all the way here just to check on how the space station is doing?
this is so her style, isn't it?
training fungi and then domesticating them?
let me say it again: the one who kills the most abominations within an hour wins.
a certain celestial jade-playing divination commission employee, perhaps?
ahem! only a true marechaussee hunter is capable of passing through this final door.
now that i see you again, i realize your sword was right. it wasn't me who took your sword. it was you who lost focus.
the visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the stellaron. she knew that alisa rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it
there's nobody else at the scene. seems like miss sparkle used the same method to "send" dreamers back to reality let's talk to those two there then.
we still have a chance, though. to make it happen... please, black swan, guide us to those with a strong will.
but seeing as you're a hero who's been all over teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
what do you mean by that? you expected me to just keep running and hiding from my responsibility forever?
i don't think i've ever been this far away from the xianzhou before! who'd have thought i'd be hopping star systems only to wind up on this cold, icy planet?
please, mister svarog
i used to have a much wider range of choices when it came to food, but now, i'm finding that simple, traditional home cooking can be quite delicious too.
thank you for the help, tighnari. make sure you rest up for now.
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel
lastly, there's that craftsman wearing artisanship commission clothing. he's unusually focused on checking that device.
i ought to sit down and conceptualize how to incorporate and play up the way of the dazzling ninja in my narration
change of plan. i've decided to stay in belobog.
as the fragmentum spreads underground, more monsters go roaming around causing trouble for all the towns. that means more vagrants in the mines.
he fooled the silvermane guards into thinking he'd changed but we won't be falling for that act again any time soon!
in the first stage, candidates are required to submit a manifesto for liyue's development. in the second stage, we will ask them some questions in person.
they didn't recognize me. from what i could tell, they were drinking coffee and talking about one of the operas that started running recently.
if she was there too then i understand. she wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? clara's always been a kind-hearted girl
we have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. well, i say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
come on stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
you saw it all for yourselves. i'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
hi, we meet again what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
one day, i will hunt them down. every last one.
you've spent long enough living in lies, bronya. this is your chance to break out of the cage.
i will leave the tenryou and yashiro commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
surprised? my reasons are pretty simple.
please, lady keqing? this is really important to me
and, as a memokeeper, i also have to fulfill my responsibilities and harvest some interesting memories.
if only i had a little more free time i'd love to take you around and show you everything we did to make the city look special during the festival.
oh, i wanted to ask you -- that bronya girl is she really a silvermane guard?
but i know you're going to say "but," right?
wishful thinking is only going to lead to disappointment, idyia. let's stick to the plan, we'll get there.
anyway, when it's finished, let me know. i'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.
did that all get a little heavy for you? i think you prefer me when i'm just teasing you, don't you? hehe
the information about robin, firefly... and the other victims... i don't see any commonalities among them.
if she doesn't want to reveal the commission's secrets, then you have no choice but to wait.
forget it, mirror. let's just leave.
how's it going, my little layla? have you been teaching your opponents a lesson?
i was planning on making a few trips to bring everything back, before continuing on with my shopping but i don't think i'll have the time.
the fact you're standing here right now must mean things are pretty much taken care of?
that means mavuika doesn't have to just sacrifice herself to the ruler of death. she can still use her death to get something in return.
from there, we can say that the difference between an abomination and a xianzhou person is not one of taxonomy, but one of culture.
stable connection to the ley lines, no unexpected fluctuations both good signs.
i'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
hm if i hadn't moved away when i did, i'd probably be where they are right now.
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool
look, i'm sorry, okay!? i'm sorry i drew a line in the sand without thinking about every possible grain on the other side!
huh? i just think that he well, i, ah, think it might be a little early to talk about formally pressing charges
i'll definitely come by more often
the reason being that she lost to me. and when i say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. it was quite a humiliating defeat.
greetings, my honored preceptor. it's been a while since we last touched base. i've brought a friend with me today. i believe you're already familiar with each other.
whenever you're free, let me know and i'll do a performance for you.
don't worry, i've trained myself to remember everything i hear.
svarog wants to preserve humanity, but he's not concerned about what humans truly think.
what huge elixir crucibles. there's still smoke coming out of them.
well, what do you think? is inazuman cuisine to your liking?
you are mortals, and thus under their protection. there was no way they would have regarded you as someone with the ability to assassinate a god.
good thing we had mister farhad with us, or else that would've taken way longer.
i guess aurelie must have written all of this down in the hope that her records would one day be of use to investigators.
just like the master diviner -- no matter what cruel and horrible paths she foresaw, as long as it benefited the luofu, she had to make a choice.
i never thought i'd hear that word again after being expelled by the architects come on, i'll tell you everything.
i also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver beidou's message. here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
oh, you must be the professional lady guuji hired? i was just wondering why i hadn't seen you yet
failure doesn't mean weakness. only the strong can gather the will to resist the order and try to break free.
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
let's go get ourselves some answers.
only to mom. you know i still don't get along with dad.
if yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
hee-hee, i've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious
i've checked the area, nothing strikes me as out of the ordinary. looks like this chapter has come to a close.
there's a pleasant breeze and glorious sunshine so, where shall we go for a walk?
i'm honored to have her think of me this way. if i have a chance in the future, i would really like to invite her to one of my performances.
my, my, who have we here?
no one in the brigade was any kind of hero, instead, my father and his cronies were more like the bad guys that needed to be taken down.
alcohol has a way of making people share what they really think, so engur and delavar are always rambling in the tavern about how king deshret is a superior deity.
but soon, the resistance will fall. they are no match for the might of the shogun's army her schemes mean nothing now.
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
well anyway, there's a dangerous situation at the divination commission at the moment, so just don't go in there!
you two have heard of port ormos, haven't ya? it's the largest commercial port in all of sumeru. you can travel there by leaving sumeru city and heading south along the river.
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
she runs a regular q&a column in "that's life" magazine. the people of inazuma absolutely adore her.
mm high winds. an incendiary attack would be particularly effective.
you may have been blinded by fame and fortune in the beginning, but your actions during the final battle had proven you to be a true marechaussee hunter.
mm here you are. i hope the medicine is of help to you
she sure knows how to boss people around.
so, hurry to the sanctuary of surasthana. assuming nothing weird happened
you may not know me, traveler and paimon, but i've certainly heard about you.
oh, probably because it was the theater asking.
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
come to think of it, i didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
be at ease, i'm not here to see commissioner kamisato. actually, i'd prefer to spend this time chatting with the traveler. please, fetch the tea set at your convenience.
if you're asking from the perspective of comfort i like it very much.
however, for some reason, pascal keeps getting attacked by his fellow robots, because the automatons think he's a fragmentum creature.
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
my powers of suggestion are capable of convincing people to accept my orders all without a second thought.
"the book is selling exceptionally well, traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. when is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
be careful when you draw your swords, and make sure you don't hurt each other.
so i'm not going to perform, and that is that.
it's the same with gepard. i could tell it took a lot for him to lay down his arms.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
if i were you, mister president, i would think of ways to translate the success of that one sample into something that can benefit everyone.
master diviner, i've brought you the guests, though it wasn't your order i received.
hmph there's no way back anyway. at least cocolia won't catch us off guard now. so what if it's an ambush!? we're not about to lose now!
congratulations, little ones. you've passed the third round of the test of courage.
don't look so worried! i'm not throwing you another mission.
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
and we'll all be there for them. our warm, welcoming community will show them the same kindness we were shown in the past.
i know how much it means to you. it was a gift from your mom before she left liyue harbor, wasn't it?
i'll take you over to the location now. i should warn you that i haven't been there myself yet, so i'm not sure how dangerous things could get
after seeing you all cheering for me though, i suppose i really tried to bring my best to the game.
it's been a long time since you last spoke with ping. and liyue harbor is always decorated so beautifully during the festival period
wait, don't go! take it easy, i just wanted to ask you a question
topaz has something else to take care of, you'll be seeing her later. talks can still continue between the two of us.
if you know nothing about martial arts, why were you smirking earlier?
swords are more honest than words. it's much easier to judge a sword than to judge someone's words, so i rarely make mistakes.
you remain silent as you prepare a pot and fire to use for cooking. the woman stares at you with her mouth agape as you skillfully cut the ingredients and toss them into the pot.
does this place ring any bells, misha?
hardly the worst thing in the world, of course. but it has caused obstacles for me in the past.
i think little gui's talents would go unappreciated in a lot of settings being a street performer is her true calling!
rough patch that's a mild way to put it.
as much as i am interested to hear your story, i'm afraid i've already taken up too much of your time mister dan heng's worrying has created ripples in the water.
hmph, the real competition is just getting started.
centuries of pretending to be a different person changes you completely. i'm not the same person i once was.
feel free to hang out here for a bit. it'd be nice if you could also get to know some other people at the theater!
did you feel the shift? so many elixir seekers arrive on the xianzhou in the hope of obtaining the formula to immortality, but none have succeeded.
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
oh, that~ it's a botanical specimen -- little lynxy sent it during one of her research trips.
nice! you guys are pretty handy -- you picked that up in no time. wanna be my assistants? average pay, but i'm a good boss.
when our workload is light, my coworkers sometimes organize social events.
let's open that package right here, right now -- then we'll see what he's hiding!
maybe i am, maybe i'm not. but hey, if i do become tianshu, i'll look out for you guys.
you're going alone? that's the ipc's headquarters.
it's fine. i don't mind, so long as i can alleviate your suspicions.
so you should also mind my warning, meng. if you won't let go of the past, i might reunite you two sooner than you think.
but now, i've also learned that while these merchant principles may apply to humans, they falter in the face of the gods.
let's not touch it for now. we still don't know enough about our environment.
well, thank you both! i'll have to treat you to a meal after all this ends. i really, really appreciate all of your help.
is there anything else in your "script" about me? i'd like to know what kind of footnote "i" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they
with the mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
ooh, great idea! we even have a professional photographer with us. charlotte, would you do us the honor?
case closed! i never knew catching heliobi would require so much work
ms. yun, i've already heard something about the reason for your involvement. you are looking for a venue for your new opera, aren't you?
if it was the growth serum, cappet would've been turned into a giant.
come with me. i've already reconned the perimeter, so we should be safe.
this is a deserted island, so explosions shouldn't trouble anyone it's just a bit of relaxation, right?
well hello there, young ones. what brings you to the shrine? it just so happens that i have a wonderful novel here. i highly recommend it.
where did the morning go alright, soon as i see a good spot, i'll set up the stove and cook us some lunch.
maybe you're right, or not. right now i just need more time to think.
yes. and just like your piece, the jade chamber piece will be scaled for the game.
none. the ruin was completely impenetrable. the only way they could have gotten through the solid rock would've been by blowing it open with a special kind of explosive.
sea gazer. i believe you're familiar with the name?
she likes having fun and being around people. she can take care of the excitement, and i'll take care of everyone's safety.
ninja hiryu is right. since i have already relinquished the super ninja scroll, i'll rely on my fists to awaken these ninja initiates that succumbed to the way of the fiendling.
for now, while i figure out the form that eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
i was very interested in the express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where i left them. now i can't remember anything about it.
i heard the wardance is about to be held in the mortal world. i remember watching a sword duel at the wardance with my sister when we were young.
huh? what's wrong with that? everyone around here knows the way i work
indeed. we need only sound them out and--
since assuming the role of helm master, it's rare that i have the chance to gaze upon the stars like this
n--no, why would anything have happened?
here's what i need you to do: go into town and find evidence of the tenryou commission's betrayal.
i'm sure the grand master will have given due consideration to razor's circumstances. perhaps he felt that now would be the most appropriate time.
sewing is an art in its own right. you're more talented than you give yourself credit for, idyia.
that was my first time seeing you in battle you've got some moves, don't you? no wonder you were able to save the underworld.
but in my professional opinion i think there's a lot of potential here that's not really being fully utilized.
"be it but three moons from the start, he who returns is not he that departs."
take, par exemple, how this troupe pines for their late director things such as this i have never witnessed before. and so, i should like to observe, perchance to understand.
any evidence he's left is not going to be immediately obvious. we'll have to look carefully, and think critically.
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
well then, that's that. i've still got some other business to attend to, so shall we say goodbye for now?
oh? well this'll be fun. let's see if a forest ranger can outperform an outrider.
if these infiltrators rely on the medicine to maintain their disguise, then following this lead in our investigation seems prudent. please follow me.
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
revenge is also a form of the hunt. however, that doesn't explain how she managed to bring the stellaron into the scalegorge waterscape, which was guarded by the vidyadhara.
thank you for your hard work. if there are any other members who still feel uneasy, please tell them on my behalf that protecting the dreamscape requires everyone's help.
someone had once questioned my research and said it was not science. well, i replied: "who said this is science? have you ever seen magic?"
sure, i guess now's not really a good time for stories don't worry -- i can sum it up in a single sentence.
the man regards you with doubt and concern. after a period of inner struggle, he lets out a long sigh, and informs you of the locations where the monsters have appeared.
also, if our clapper loader could avoid shouting at the start of the scene next time
thank you, all of you. now i know that this place serves refreshments for both the body and the mind. is that why you and kaeya like the tavern so much?
idyia, the situation is now critical. our window of opportunity to fix this is rapidly closing.
there's no more hydro archon, you know and it's still a little early to celebrate.
even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. there are countless things that humans cannot change.
it all comes down to being an experienced warrior.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
i don't know, this is the first time i've run into a situation like this i would write to my cousin, but i think we're out of time
what's wrong? are you not feeling well?
but if we didn't take care of those monsters, what were you planning to do? just stay here, shaking in your boots?
great. this is going well.
i'm trying to find my own room too, and i heard a commotion here... so i came to take a look. luckily your door was open, or it could've gotten dangerous. that man looked like he was up to no good.
if he had taken the time to read the decree, it's unlikely he ever would have ended up in this predicament.
i'm surprised the vagrants in the great mine go after the mining teams, they must be desperate.
oh, nothing. i just zoned out for a moment.
i see it seems like you have made up your mind.
we've heard about a certain zhiyi who's been selling fresh fish at low prices in this area recently. do you know anything about this?
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
lady aglaea's contributions to okhema deserve more appreciation, but people mostly see her as distant and aloof.
how did everything go? any luck with your missions?
it's a shame, they still wouldn't give him a permit, even though he was born and raised in inazuma.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
actually, inayah had prepared a special present for everyone before this celebration kicked off.
we've got one final stop. let's go.
you're telling me off again. fine, whatever bro. you better be going, come listen to pela and my next rehearsal.
it was probably sent to the inn that we're staying at.
no need, i've left the mora under the plate. if you try to settle it with her in person, she won't accept payment for the salad.
so you guys aren't that close after all? i thought you were sworn friends.
that's wonderful! you two absolutely mustn't miss the sabzeruz festival!
we have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
in theory, that means khaenri'ahn souls shouldn't be drawn to the presence of the night kingdom. something strange is going on
i'd be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.
furthermore i want to go see the place for myself. i want to know if my father is still there
if for some reason they didn't receive the letters, then please tell everyone that there will be a feast here!
ifa doesn't know what's going on, so he agreed no questions asked. ororon would find the gem as soon as he opened the bag. he knows how important it is, so i knew he would make the switch.
traveler, you're an adventurer do you understand what i mean?
uh what's going on?
of course i did. i cut my palm, and bled quite a lot. but master was not concerned. she just stood there and casually lectured me about itaeur"
just as i thought. they didn't go to liyue harbor aeur" they went that way.
in which case, i think i'll take this opportunity to show you a skill that i used to be rather proud of.
i've wondered at times what the luofu should give the nameless in return for their great deeds
well, originally it was simply a place where winemakers and farmers would come to trade in raw ingredients for wine-making.
craft a mask based on a personality type
but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
greetings, venerable adeptus. and greetings, ganyu.
what are you writing miss march?
i wasn't expecting to receive vip shrine visitors during down time. hehe, so i suppose you're here just to visit me?
ha, not interested -- i need time, not money!
so what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all
afterwards, we also found he had an antidote on him. had the fatui official grown suspicious, zhiyi would have drunk the poisoned wine himself, and then found an opportunity to take the antidote shortly afterwards.
back when i decided to isolate myself in the plane of euthymia, there was no yae publishing house, and certainly no stories of this kind.
i understand. you mean to say that we should be more informal in the way we interact with each other.
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
of course, sam and silver wolf would have broken us out, but bladie would've been gravely injured, and our relationship with the xianzhou would've been damaged beyond repair.
that's right, no one else in aurum alley needs to worry -- it's all on me.
to strike your foe takes unity between mind, arrow, and bow.
yep, but in the part you heard, he hadn't become the first sage yet. there's more to the story
the key to making sure a conversation goes well is choosing the right topic.
you should be thanking me because if it weren't for me cleaning up this mess penacony would still be in shambles. don't you think?
i wish it were made up unfortunately it's all true.
yes she is a high-ranking member of the ipc, after all. she knows how to use words to her advantage.
with your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
i will return to the kujou encampment and plan our defenses for the other regions.
it's alright, my lady. you were hurt by all of this as well. truth be told, i'm starting to feel a little guilty, watching you cry like this
that will depend on our assessment of our own abilities.
"believe in the furina you see on stage. she is the one you can trust."
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
hmm i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
we can only hope to learn the truth from one titan.
they do. the architects believe that hell can exist on any world -- a plight that will inevitably come to be without intervention.
i clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of mondstadt
but the whole thing also made me realize that there are still many problems in sumeru, and as a desert-dweller, i'm still not completely ready to settle down on this side of the wall.
the sky-faring commission has reserved rooms for you at the petrichor inn. when you finish your business here, how about some tea together?
they set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
as such, it is my privilege to work with you on this exciting project.
you couldn't have advertised your guilty conscience more clearly if you'd tried.
my, my. yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. i like it very much.
you helped a lot with the investigation and arrest anyway, so it's perfectly fair for you to get all the credit. just take it aeur" it works better for me too.
he's a long-life species, apparently he was sword champion of the xianzhou at some point.
the knights of favonius were all very busy dealing with the aftermath of the incident. i'm a bit ashamed of myself for it
my thinking was that only people who pre-order the chess set at full price will be eligible to receive the limited-edition traveler chess piece.
i also pay great attention to the ways of the world just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
to be honest, i'm not really cut out to be a leader. at first, my dream was to read up on military strategy and perhaps become an adviser.
i made a laughingstock out of myself. i might've spent too much time away from work aeur" my intuition is not as accurate as it used to be.
they are simply ordinary items. and there was no coercion or enticement during the auction aeur" every bid was voluntary.
hoolay, from the very moment you stepped into my mind, you had already lost.
i've watched every one of her matches. she constantly adapts her strategy, and excels at employing rare and unusual tactics.
yeah, that makes sense general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
have you all considered this? perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned akivili never reached
a razor, some buttons, some round iron tiles, a wooden toy puppet
as long as i can fulfill that deep-seated desire i don't care how long i live.
what's wrong, gepard? ahh, i see can't let go of your dear ol' sister, eh?
if we want to get our evidence, we're going to need some help. now come with me. we must awaken the professional.
the tag on the tie reads "only for imperial master lefton" seems like it's one of miss sparkle's personal belongings.
he probably has a lot of things he wants to say, but will now perhaps never get a chance to.
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
qingque, i've been thinking through the calculations for this puzzle -- there really is only one solution.
ah, you're too kind. it was straight from the usual playbook, if i'm honest.
march. your master has dropped out of the contest. this is a great opportunity for you to stick your neck out!
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
i didn't know gangs could have auxiliary members
nothing else you wanted to add? let's leave it there then. time to go.
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all that's really weird.
i received bronya's message before the inauguration ceremony. she told me everything that happened north of belobog -- about the stellaron, and cocolia's sacrifice
actually, while we're on the topic, i have an assignment i'd like to give you, namely:
oh no what should we do
alhaitham probably just liked the way i worked and knew i'm good in a fight, so he suggested i find some work in the akademiya.
i'll ask mingxi for some more ideas later. let's go back to yancui's place.
hehe, i felt so guilty at first, like i always owed someone something. i was always thinking of ways to repay others.
well i'm still me. there is no doubt about that.
it's nothing as serious as that. if left unattended, the most it could do is stir up some chaos in your mind and generally worsen your mood.
we've known each other for some time now. she's a pretty interesting person. even though she's an extremely strong warrior, she never misuses her power against others.
i never thought slacking off could convince me of anything the sign of a true scholar! a diviner of the divination commission after all!
wait, what do you mean, "either"?
if you're only concerned with my next answer, quit while you're ahead. every choice has consequences, and every consequence carries responsibility.
where is mister shamari right now? i'd like to meet him.
according to my grandpa, he and my great-uncle once went traveling together when they were young. they ended up at chenyu vale, where they met a pharmacist.
but eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, ei.
i tested it so many times just to make sure and now that i finally boarded the express, it doesn't even work. oh well, luckily, i brought along some sparklers too!
if you insist, there is one dish that perhaps you could try making for me. it's an old recipe from my grandfather's notes.
but since we've decided on a debate, i'll do my best to prepare for it. i'll gather everyone's thoughts and let them be known to all during the debate.
so we've got to switch trains, right? huh? what's that?
welcome, astral expressers. looks like you caught me.
thank you all, thank you so much!
(he changed the topic without batting an eye! good thing i'm prepared.)
the traveler has done a lot for liyue in the past, and yanfei is a renowned legal consultant in liyue, so i can trust their intentions. as for you two
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal tends to leave a deep impression.
as plans go, changing the deity's mind is a huge gamble to begin with. we can't expect to be in control of every last detail when we're facing off against a god, can we?
all of it exists within the border between the living and the dead, an ordinary place, really. the only special thing about it is that nobody really knows about it.
no, but what is predetermined is the future that has value.
is that so... you're good then. what sort of training did you have to undergo? can you teach me?
haha, let's go then. first, we need to think of a way to get to the other side.
all of these sudden deaths and unfulfilled wishes remind us that long-life species still live out insignificant and limited lives.
so i'll put the points under kaveh's name, then?
it was largely an oversight on my part: i taught you to nurture a warrior's will, but never how to let it go.
so this tablet was created not so that the hunters would be remembered by the people, but so that they would be remembered by each other.
of all the things i could have bought, i thought it would be best to have the money go to you. that way, i can support a charitable cause while i'm at it.
only some who have gone under their shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more nihility... that's all.
you'll see shortly. the one who spent the most money will surely be the quickest to realize.
i wouldn't want general jing yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
okhema is approaching its end. i do not wish to give my people false hope not when we've been badly scarred by it before.
how was it? did you dream of me?
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
no, i think they might be just overly careless. i seem to have found the location where they've been stashing all their stolen goods. they must have thought it was well-hidden and deemed it unnecessary to post any guards.
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences and can come to represent what we seek the most.
or maybe you'd rather try this? i know, i know aeur" i normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
the carving? you mean the one i gave you?
yes, but not entirely.
well, what do you say? aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
but then again, gifts should be lasting. what about a delightful new bouquet of flowers on the table each day? wouldn't they do a better job at brightening up someone's day?
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
would you like me to slice their throats with golden threads? it would be done in a flash. all i need is your blessing, and the council will be no more.
so then. the day's ahead of us. any ideas on how to spend it?
under the might of an aeon, the sacrifices of ordinary creatures are but a joke we are nothing we mean nothing
had you ever stopped to consider the trouble it would bring to so many people? had you considered how many enemies you would make trying to keep the plans under wraps?
calling starskiff haven. have all cloud knights be on full alert for borisin attacks!
everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. the greatest wish of the local pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the gilded hour.
(she already agreed to this. she wants to win, no matter what. me too.)
you two, this way. i'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
if this is what they want, i'm always up for a challenge!
i just bumped into himeko. we got chatting, and, well i never knew she was such an expert.
i should have gotten involved earlier, but i was tied up with other responsibilities. my apologies for letting you take on the investigation without proper support.
notification sent. i guess now we should go to the divination commission and see what's going on?
ahh, i'm so sorry to trouble you like this i meant to invite you to our celebration, but now, you're helping me instead
when did the antimatter legion become so weak?
now, get some rest and prepare yourselves for the operation ahead. i look forward to seeing you in action~
oh, there's no mask that can hide true bloodlust. cover up your eyes and it'll still show itself at the corners of your mouth.
but looking back, haven't you learned something more important than just swordplay?
whether it's a one-off or not, it's a boundary that i've committed to no longer cross.
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing
the loud noises we heard earlier were probably the result of large numbers of mechanisms we're ready and waiting for an opportunity to storm the domain.
it seems like the intel we got from svarog caused her a significant shock but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
then let us snap them all out of their disillusionment!
today is indeed a momentous day to have brought us all together. i propose that i treat everyone to a meal to mark the occasion, if it pleases you all?
and thinking about it, bernard only attracted our attention in the first place because he came to look for bonnie.
neuvillette is not the type to take much time off. taking even a half-day for himself is already a huge step in the right direction.
hey! did either of you hear a word i just said!?
the extent of the corrosion here is a lot worse than i imagined. misess hinkel did say the clean-up had been slow in places...
i'm the complete march seventh with all of your forgotten memories.
the forest of blessings this book has been recording simulanka's history all along
if we'd had more time, we could have built a barrier here to absorb the impact of the waves.
rise and shine! the two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift.
...i ended that man's life, alone.
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur
of course not. the memokeepers' divination techniques don't all involve memories.
sometimes i wonder whether your head's screwed on right. we need to take you to the alchemy commission for a check-up.
so, it really is a baseball bat.
although this small robot appears to want to communicate, its speech is all scrambled
i'd like to invite all of you, as witnesses to this war, to a soul-soothing ceremony hosted by the sky-faring commission. will you consider?
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
i've thought about it, and well, if i were bronya, i wouldn't sign it.
in your eyes, our shows can't meet the akademiya's expectations.
people join wildfire for themselves, for the newborn next door without a mother, for the elderly with no home to return to.
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
uh, naeur"no, it's something very important. in fact, iaeur"i must see lady ningguang about it immediately
pengyi? what's wrong? what are you doing here?
is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
in fact, the name "baal" and the title of raiden shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up untilaeur"
if we were sticklers about truth and fiction, we would've missed out on so much beauty and emotion.
normally, i have to make a special request to the chef if i want it to taste like this.
nameless ninjas? are you talking about the nameless? we have names, you know. i'm march seventh and he's dan heng.
we talked about a lot of things -- how she repaired the express, all about her adventures, a certain resident fluffy conductor, and you guys
this man on the wanted list he's a stellaron hunter, right? is that?
why don't we go check out that tavern? if the novels i've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.
it seems the gods have really smiled upon you, xavier and that certainly doesn't include me, mind you.
the shogun can't do much at the moment. come straight in and see me.
i already picked up a few gifts earlier, so that means there's only three more left to go. but we've already lost a lot of time, so we'd better not drag our feet
the scent where did it go?
and yet all of you now represent a third choice -- different from both the merchant guild and the ipc.
oh, we should probably give these props back, right? i'll just leave mine here.
ms. rekhar can't go on adventures anymore, but she has found a stable career and a new life at the theater.
it's not polite to ask a girl her age, no matter which xianzhou ship you're on.
so that's what you think of me? yet another transgression to avenge
just one box. the rest were given to me. i really don't know how it came to this much
the thief has stolen parts again? how am i going to track down this crook?
what i mean is i hope you enjoy yourself here.
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
besides, even if he's caught, the guards would be too scared to do anything to him they've never seen lesser lord kusanali in person, after all.
so high priest tribbie can be strict too
this is your plane of euthymia. it's your inner world.
what a nice day! let's go have some fun!
so you've been watching us from the very beginning?
you've already met junkichi and shigeru.
as far as i'm concerned, though your showing in the duel was enough to prove your honor.
you know how much you're willing to pay me to be the director? the pay is also an important factor for me to consider, you know!
no problem! the rules are actually quite simple. to start with, i've made some minor tweaks to the snowshine lamps, making it possible for heat to be transferred between them
don't worry. even without their intel, i've already detected hidden currents within the city. a trivial issue, nothing i can't handle on my own.
anyway, no point in standing around here worrying. i'm heading back to the alley. talk to you soon!
i suppose you heard? you're this year's windblume star. you will be making an offering of windblumes to the anemo archon, barbatos, on behalf of the whole of mondstadt.
general jing yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, i'll take care of it for you. you need the final word from the ten-lords commission to quell any doubts.
we also defeated an ancient robot known as "svarog," and learned some truths about the stellaron.
if i had to pick something, i guess i'd like to explore this place thoroughly.
i firmly believe that with the determination of everyone, our world, the world the trailblazers call "jarilo-vi," will no longer be alone among the stars.
in the end, i haven't been able to guard anything. how could they have thought i was worthy to be the successor
i'm already set on helping you buy two new outfits. i mean, who wears the same thing at work and home, anyway?
in the past, every household would brew fresh wine around this time of year, and keep it sealed at least until windcoming day during the following year's weinlesefest.
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
anyway, i actually came over to let everyone know that we're all done for today. you can go home and get some rest!
so what we're going to do is create inazuma's newest hit novel.
i mean, just as i thought, master dugu is indeed as kind and virtuous as the legends claim.
however, if it was poisoned in the battle over mondstadt all those years ago
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
i feel a warmth from these emotions. i feel drawn to this quality, and try to respond back in my own way
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see
her parents used to be artisans in the commission, so i think she has some nostalgic connection to the place.
because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
hehe it's mainly sour with just a tinge of sweetness, and a lingering aftertaste.
well, give it some thought. i'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
everyone in aaru village needs to take good care of themselves.
so this mister norbert could well be the museum thief we're looking for?
then i should do my best to honor it.
it's not for you to decide whether it was a legitimate transaction or not.
the workers here are very skilled, so i like to come to them when i need something custom-made.
you already asked that when we first got here.
why would you think that? i've never harbored any ill intentions well, not when you were around, anyway.
after all, this is the only place i'm able to lose the helm master uniform and relax a little.
i'm really sorry about what happened back in the great mine mister svarog doesn't trust any humans besides me, especially everyone from wildfire.
and it's not just me aeur" i think everyone else here feels the same way. if we're unhappy, we should speak up and let our voices be heard.
no. someone i've never met before. today's lunch will be our first time meeting each other.
turns out that idyia has a cooking stove and oven. seriously, why didn't she mention it earlier
alright, i agree. as long as it helps you with your research, you can do whatever you want.
i once felt regret for those that were lost without a trace, but fortunately, we were later able to sense, discover, and preserve them.
yanqing mentioned you before. he said that you're not to be underestimated and that your weapon has a unique shape.
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
well, there's nothing else for it, we're duty-bound to help the ten-lords commission
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. by decree of the ten lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
anyway, even if you don't find tail, you're still a great judge -- the success of our ghost-hunting squad proves it.
lauwick, your character has no more scenes, correct?
i know this is a lot to ask out of the blue, so apologies in advance.
that healer with the odd name and peculiar temperament what was his name again? was it pichu? or kaqiu?
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
let's go report to natasha in boulder town, it won't take long to get back.
a long, long time ago, on one of greater lord rukkhadevata's birthdays, her friends threw her a celebratory banquet.
he says my swordsmanship is outstanding, and i think he's a master both in the past and present. so you could say we completely approve of each other now!
do not be mistaken. i speak only in the interests of fairness.
while i was passed out, she went and caused all kinds of trouble i neglected my duty of keeping her from making a mess of things.
that's an answer i can accept. oleg, what do you think?
i hereby swear on my name and honor as a champion duelist that mister callas never intended to leave the ring alive.
looks normal enough on the surface let's take a closer look.
when the trace of the hunted disappears, the hunter better think twice
i suppose you have a point. it would be quite impolite of me to leave the two of you now.
looks like you've forgotten -- there is a memokeeper girl in front of the express' shattered mirror.
so, do let me know when you have more stories to share. i'm sure the kids will love them.
as for the potential liabilities we didn't have time to discuss earlier one good place to start might be the fungi power-up materials.
i don't know who the "mother" that you're referring to is, but
even you benefactors have probably lived longer than me.
no need to thank me. as long as you like them.
thank you, windblume star, for your sincere windblume offering to the anemo archon, barbatos. may the wind protect mondstadt.
...if we can start investigating on the way, that'd be good.
it's probably an isolated glitch.
even in its fully functional state, the night kingdom can't accept foreign souls. it's completely isolated from the ley lines of other nations.
still, i'm glad you're unscathed. confronting that number of fatui at once can be dangerous.
"your name shall be padisarah. may you bloom in this world as beautifully as the flower i love."
a bunch of them have bad endings, though. like, oh aeur" the fire diamond will get put in a rich person's gallery, where it will never be ignited again.
look for another -- every platform linked to the gear bridge should have a similar terminal.
you're with the astral express?
thank you for your patience, mister alfalfa. let's continue our discussion.
if you let us in we can do a routine service inspection i've worked on various iterations of this type of installation
it was the most beautiful sky i had ever seen but all i could feel was unbearable pain. i sunk to the ground and gazed up helplessly.
ah, i remember! the three outsiders! wait -- why are you still strolling around the city? do you know the silvermane guards are looking all over for you?
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
ahhhh, which means what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
mm-hmm, i picked the venue especially for you aeur" a humble local eatery called kiminami restaurant.
there's no need to rush to the ring just yet, let's get to know your opponents around here first.
this is a medal given to me by the architects see that blue stone in the middle? that's a geomarrow crystal of the highest purity.
you don't understand. the one preventing us from getting close to the truth is cocolia herself.
oh, um, i i don't think that will be necessary
i'll find some time to accompany you to shop for a clock, lest you oversleep and miss something important.
the qixing have prepared some small gifts for you to celebrate this festive occasion. there are some seasonal goods, two bolts of fine silk, and some exotic flower seeds which i picked specifically for you, madame ping.
then, how can i ask inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
(or perhaps i'm still not fashionable enough? but that can't be, right? ugh, don't tell me they're still getting the impression that i'm super old-fashioned)
death is not part of our plan, lord gnaeus. we should work on solving the puzzle they've set for us.
trap? hardly. think of it as a ritual that allows us to communicate.
i'll be there once i am finished inspecting this place.
let's go, and watch your step. i haven't been here in a long time. there are probably some monsters around.
don't let him fool you. everyone in the underworld knows that this brat is a no-good thief. if i remember correctly, even the clothes you're wearing came off another kid's back?
(he had to set up so many scenes today, and now, he has to join in for this last part i really don't envy his job.)
i was worried that the excess of protection would make her feel uneasy, so i asked her to stay inside the palais. it's very safe in there.
i am no exception my identity as a marechaussee hunter is not something i need people to remember. i wish only to be recognized as a champion duelist, nothing more.
let the soldiers recuperate. but don't let your guard down aeur" if she returns with a vengeance, we must be prepared.
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
he was a famed artist, but he recognized that very few people could connect with his works.
didn't you say that the villager got his news from the tavern? well, i also like to drink at the tavern, so i know a thing or two about these radicals he mentioned.
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
but i've never left sumeru city before, so suddenly being taken to a new place is
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
of course! for your safety, i want to ensure that everything you see is manageable. i don't want you to lose your mind in the simulation!
good, i look forward to your instruction.
but even so, they are due a resolution i owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
that's too kind of you. my job involves ferrying business delegates to and from starskiff haven, so i do this kind of introduction all the time.
lord gnaeus, now that we're at the very heart of castrum kremnos it's time to let you in on our goal here.
i heard that you broke one of the ten-lords commission's sacred instruments, and almost--
i am currently unwilling to deal with any business. i am also incapable of it.
i think about this every time i listen to diviner fu talk. we are both from xianzhou, but are we really speaking the same language?
even so, it doesn't really solve anything
didn't i make myself clear at the time? the decisions of the gods are naturally difficult for humans to comprehend. there is no need to provide an explanation
brought him back? can someone please explain?
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
my brother is still obsessed with anything remotely related to the "forbidden zone." but knowing him, it won't be long before we get more leads.
are there any other ways for adventurers to make mora besides their remuneration from the guild?
not yet, everything looks normal so far. i think the problem is stemming from the energy hub.
these tracks are superficial, but they definitely didn't occur naturally. something heavy was being dragged this way meaning, we're headed in the right direction.
remember, let out all your frustrations before bedtime for a better night's rest. if you want, i'm more than happy to be your audience.
an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards and the stench of death in the air.
hmm memokeepers should probably think of a better way to show up.
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
this way, i can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much aeur" it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
now, we also know that every aspect of the vision hunt decree's promulgation and execution has been enthusiastically spearheaded by the tenryou commission from the outset.
since no one's around to entertain us, let's make ourselves at home. stay close to me so that my "white" can cover you, too.
you open your envelopes at the same time. the message reads
master, are these creations truly able to protect the artisanship commission? there's already been so much destruction -- why haven't we seen any in action?
but all they're really after are my words any morsel of information that may hint at liyue's future commercial trends.
well? the things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
normally, of course, i would come to purchase one myself. but on this occasion, my duties at the irodori festival had to take priority.
shoulda, coulda, woulda, seele! activating the gear bridge alone would've been enough to expose us.
before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto, once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
let's get closer and find a place to hide so we can observe him.
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
let me introduce you to robin. she woke up from ena's dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
if that's the case, it can only have one goal: to trap us here until we die. what else could it be?
how perceptive. our wind, clouds, rain, and fog are all artificial. the realm-keeping commission's weather pavilion manages the environmental conditions here.
mornings are good, aren't they? they are the start of a new day, which means there is plenty of time left to rest some more.
you have keen observation skills, and a love for living things. you'd be better served directing your energies there rather than sighing and whining all the time.
from the moment i walked in, i made it clear that the questions i'd ask might not reflect my actual thoughts.
i was always meticulous with the most menial of tasks. my mother always loved that about me.
turn around and look. we can see the entire city of okhema from here.
of course, the one time i wish you could read my mind, it doesn't work
but let's stay calm until we're one hundred% sure.
you are no match for me, and therefore, no match for blade either. let me accompany you -- there is no need to throw your life away.
i don't think i asked you what you thought of it at the time, though. what do you think? be honest.
i also felt that the space was targeting us, but yanfei managed to exploit its weakness. leave it to yanfei to find a loophole.
clouds knights don't visit the ambrosial arbor without a reason, plus i'm new here
besides, my problem with him wasn't that he was a strict father
his piety and wisdom were acknowledged by the dendro archon, and she finally gave her blessing to him.
response to a question with another question indicates intense suspicion and resistance a step will be recorded.
trust his judgment, and keep watching. we'll be right there.
...xipe the harmony. legend has it that they participated in the crusade against the imperator insectorum and devoured ena the order for unknown reasons.
well are those who rise in the early morn, while those late to bed i shall forewarn~
i'm simply bringing up the doubts about general jing yuan that exist within the alliance. since i'm representing them, perhaps you can just imagine me as one of those old geezers?
this is where the mechanical waste is disposed of though. could it be
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality
but that's the magic of a smile. if you don't believe me, try it. look at it a few times every day, and you'll understand.
time to get to work. let's prepare ourselves and meet that esteemed "supporting actor."
i'm not in charge of finance. go pose that to asta instead.
haha, quit worrying sushang, you've been an awesome squad member! and a very talented sleepyhead.
haha, who would've thought? that you'd be so immensely popular in some weird circle.
if only my youkai powers were stronger maybe then i'd be able to run even faster. hehe, or maybe even split myself into a ton of different clones!
my apologies for rambling on just now
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
they're referring to our mascot's true form.
all i have to do is find out where they hid the fireworks, and then return to the location with reinforcements.
yes i have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.
i warned them that their business model wouldn't work on the xianzhou without adjustments but the merchant guild's overly traditional mindset is a different obstacle.
unlike me, makoto was no martial artist. whenever similar crises had arisen in the past, i was always the one to face them in her stead.
so we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
you're right, but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
don't believe me? let me tell you, cocolia and i shared a similar way of thinking back in the day.
forget it, it's not important. old mettle and i have long since become partners who can read and respond to each other's will.
if you fail to do so, then you will receive the due punishment. have you made up your mind?
am i just a wandering spirit now?
oh! what's this gadget? this monitor, and this keyboard is it an automaton remote control terminal?
now you're bringing my great-uncle into this? baizhu just what are you planning this time?
yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
hmph, you saw right through me. why else would i be standing here today?
i will one day die, new qixing will replace the old, and liyue will continue to prosper.
good! with this much power, i daresay even the acting grand master herself would be no match for me!
they're not unwelcoming to outsiders, though. people travel there for business and leisure alike, and usually return with nothing but good things to say.
that was a little unexpected. don't worry. there's a lot more feed over there. just go get another piece.
so now, i'll become a cunning speck of dust and make those masterminds behind the curtains
and besides, you've never attended a celebration event before, so this will be a great opportunity. everyone will love you!
after all i'm not doing this on my own, right?
a reasonable request. it is indeed my oversight for failing to tell you everything in time.
of course, the other brigade members were just like him. their ruckus would go on night after night
please hand over your "statue of her excellency, the almighty narukami ogosho, god of thunder" as evidence. we will compensate you for your loss once we catch the individual responsible.
so you can definitely understand, why we want to be prepared.
i i can't believe my ears! you are truly the bravest and most passionate people of sumeru, well, that i've ever met!
once you come to friendly terms with the lawrence clan, you should be in a good position to learn more of their possible connections with the fatui.
but when it comes down to it, whatever differences there may be between the various games around, they all share one important thing in common: they bring friends together.
one thing though aeur" we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
to the south of here is port ormos, which seems to be where they're headed.
the kids at the orphanage were always getting into scraps when we played out here. if i remember it right, there ought to be some supplies for our cuts and bruises stored in that corner there.
haha, i'm not worried about that! what i meant is that we probably shouldn't go too hard on the enemy. after all, we still need to get information out of them.
now that you mention it, gaming did seem to have a rather strange attitude towards kites.
usually only emissaries from the xianzhou yaoqing's sky-faring commission visit him once every century. why do you have to visit him now, of all times?
normally it'll only take around forty-seven star calendar years.
all the literature, furniture, and ornaments i had collected followed the original jade chamber to its watery grave
how high and far a kite can fly depends as much on the weather conditions as on the skill of the person holding the string.
chartonus come to think of it, i remember hearing about them making a holy vessel for kremnos.
the most important thing is to have no regrets in the end.
a response that is certainly full of spirit, but lacking in sincerity a step will be recorded.
while the lux arrow from the reignbow possesses unparalleled power to sever the ambrosial arbor, it can't sever mortals' desire to prolong their existence.
hey, i'm seele. i'm a member of wildfire down here in the underworld. wanna help me forge a future for the people?
either way, it is good to be here together with everyone. it has lifted my spirits.
have you concluded your articulation, sir?
you'll do fine. i heard you're good with bandages. you can patch up a wound, can't you?
since when did the masked fools suddenly start respecting agreements?
you're all here on business, and it's my job to monitor the chasm. according to regulations, i should accompany you.
i ask for you to guide us. let us see what you once gazed upon, let us hear what your ears once heard
alright, alright, i see.
do you know what's become of us down here while you live the easy life? did you even consider the fate of the underworlders?
i got arlan to look after peppy because i thought they got along... but was that giving him too much extra pressure?
well, the thing is, pain is your body's way of warning you something is wrong. if you ignore it and push through you might end up with some serious injuries without even realizing it.
this area is full of mountains and rivers. it's normal to not know the fastest route.
okay, but working as a day laborer could be quite dull
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because
whatever's motivating them to speed up must be psychological. for instance reaching the home stretch.
cyno forced him to release lesser lord kusanali. he has no choice but to obey.
huh? so that's why nothing's going back to normal! c'mon, we need to hurry.
alright then. i hope the next time we meet, you will either have already done the right thing or, will be about to make the right call.
what i take from these stories is not so much the content itself, but what they represent in terms of the effects of time upon inazuma.
mister svarog scanned the robots for irregularities, but the results all came back normal.
oh, that reminds me that last person will not escape my vengeance either
thank you. i hope the next time i come i won't disturb anyone.
just like today -- would it have mattered if "baique" had brought you here instead of qingque? it makes no difference at all.
i'd like you to be shikanoin's temporary supervisor. it'll be your duty to ensure that he handles his case properly and that he doesn't disappear and neglect his work again.
did welt learn how to play celestial jade in the end? if he hasn't got the hang of it yet, tell him to come see me and i'll show him the ropes.
these names were once known all over the universe. now, they've all but disappeared, leaving behind only masterless paths.
well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. i'm natasha -- a doctor in the underground. you've already spent a day in my clinic.
you mean cloud retainer? i saw her too. she just suddenly showed up right in the middle of the street whatever adeptal power that was, she certainly knows how to make an entrance.
let's leave it there, shall we? work hard, now, hehe
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
well then that's as good as nothing for now so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one
this is a new sight for me. a rather bleak one, i must say.
i didn't find the information. it came to me. it was from a lady concerned with the future of the harmony.
keqing has taken an unusually keen interest in this giant stone, which is why we are leaving the matter in her capable hands.
mister assistant detective, please feel free to point out a suspect as the murderer.
but no disguise can mask the stench of blood. just from their suspicious looks, i bet they do dirty work like kidnapping or assassinations.
then why didn't mister callas explain himself in court? if he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
we can move on to the problem at hand, now that both of you have some understanding of amphoreus's history. come with me.
fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. to resist the invasion, the architects had no choice but to redeploy the guards to the front line.
when i was designing it, i wanted it not only to be a fun game, but also capture liyue's culture in a unique way.
sorry, i'm not quite sure either ipc tech is pretty complex -- there are some principles i'm still trying to wrap my head around.
will you stand with us as we reestablish our contracts aeur" as we build a new age of prosperity?
as you can see, after nearly one hundred days of renovation, the interior looks brand new.
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
are you a knight of beauty?
general jing yuan believes in this prophecy too, as mentioned in the report. i'm curious why you didn't question it at all?
my brother often hummed a lullaby to help me fall asleep when i was young. that was the first piece of music i learned even without lyrics, it's still the melody i hold dearest.
hey, have you been watching me while i'm not looking?
foolish question. there are only two kinds of things aeur" those that must be done and those that must not.
um, where did albedo and razor go?
uh since we're talking about him, i feel like i should add something. his martial prowess really looked certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
like i said, the sword contains a heliobus. argenti must have been under the control of the sword! maybe he was under its control even before you arrived on the luofu.
this atmosphere really feels strange are you sure topaz is here?
other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. a little bit of this, little bit of that
way i see it, if they were clever enough, they would conceal the stolen goods somewhere and then come pick them up later.
nothing? i thought there was an answer for every single permutation.
but if you're still going to cling onto your so-called mercenaries' pride, then i'll give you all a good beating as well.
(is he talking about how no one in the capital seems to remember the hunters and their legacy? i didn't expect the script to contain this level of social criticism)
to tell you the truth, mister dvorak, i am somewhat related to the adepti myself. i am part-human and part-qilin. the qilin is an illuminated beast.
but no matter where their hearts and bodies may be, they will always be family.
get hurt? why would i? don't underestimate me.
wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?
every side of me is the real me. people just like to define things in all sorts of arbitrary ways.
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
bingo. i think you got it. seems like you're learning.
when i was little, he told me that if there was anyone in the world who knew the answer, it would be the reignbow arbiter.
he has stepped onto the battlefield to fight a campaign that can only be won by him alone.
don't worry, mister yang.
yes, every celebration must come to an end.
i understand in that case, please go ahead with your plans first, mister boothill and miss march seventh.
sure you don't wanna reconsider? it's not too late to change your mind!
when lisa is around, i always have peace of mind.
this notice seems like a hint for us from miss sparkle.
ha, you're fine! just take a breather
no one knows what he did after he left jarilo-vi, and why he decided to come back.
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
i know how you feel, clara. you want new hope for the underground, but you don't want anyone to get hurt in the process, right?
how interesting. for a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.
we will certainly strive to live up to your expectations.
a witness ah, yes. i've heard that you came to teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? in other words, you never belonged here
but once the bag of tricks is empty, and the curtain falls, it's time to end the show. the spotlight is no place for someone with no more cards up their sleeve.
furthermore, i had even predicted at the time that i may wish to modify the shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. however, such changes would not be conducive to eternity.
we are just friends, i don't see what sheltering has to do with it. tell your subordinates to leave, we have things to discuss.
i did say this is what "we're" going to do. i trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
right this moment, you and i have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other's minds. this is the land of dreams's inaugural welcome for us.
this is qingxu pool. full of ruins, crawling with monsters anyone with any sense steers well clear of this place.
you know the way to the great mine, right? let's catch up with gepard when you're ready!
but the fact is that both the food and the stories have changed with time
all the outworlders arriving at xianzhou these days start their sentences with "there's an old saying in xianzhou" but a local like me can't think up any. how can this be
i'm afraid that's impossible -- the artisanship commission's hall of jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process.
before i joined the stellaron hunters, the nature of my work meant that i barely ever saw the same person twice.
the marshal believed that this would be inhumane and no different from what the borisin did, so
this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
that judge from the ten-lords commission? she doesn't seem like a warrior, but that tail of hers has some fight in it.
if we want to progress further north, we will need to cross that hell. are you ready?
after the duel between mister callas and myself.
i'll try my best to restore the data in the jade abacus, but it'll take some time.
seeing you again is a change to eternity and a very nice surprise.
i was wondering is it because they share pascal's emotions?
when the stellaron was extracted, even for that brief moment, it corroded the space station and formed a new space -- what we now call the fragmentum.
believe in your ears. it is indeed as you heard.
so was this your choice? to respond to my request for help?
ahhhh. it feels like it's been a long time since i've gotten so physical.
that's right. my lady is feeling better now, so i'm accompanying her for a walk.
good thing it rained today aeur" it means they'll leave footprints i doubt they'd give themselves away that easily, but let's follow them and try our luck.
stargazer navalia may have come to a standstill, but the alarms are operational how did she get through here?
nah, are you kidding? you're worrying too much.
hmm hey! those look like handprints on the side of the cabinet -- human handprints. could this monitor have been recently used by someone?
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
kind, as always. however, our intention doesn't necessarily change the containment device and the type of implement we need.
pascal, i'm going to change your shell. don't worry, it won't hurt
there's nothing personal in it -- have a read if you like.
at this stage, let's revisit that scene from lyney's perspective.
until our next meeting. may my songs gift you with pleasant dreams.
as a fleeting emotion, she's no different from a newborn. her boarding this ship was solely down to her inner impulse.
but this is not its most intrinsic function.
i can go and find adrian taylor, or the red-nosed old man from epsilon, or even the intelligentsia guild -- at least they won't quit halfway!
no offense, but we have no guarantee this plan of yours will succeed, or even that it's safe.
in other words this forest is a stage, and all i need to do is step out into the spotlight? hehe, sounds just like a fairytale!
oh, you beat me to it. looks like your brain is intact.
this is an automaton direwolf, but it appears to have been modified. it's most likely another abandoned robot pet
"stars hung from its branches" then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
are we really going to eat that?
for now, i'll leave this domain in your hands. please keep a careful watch.
pretending to use your dad again as an excuse if he knew about this, you'd be in big trouble.
the verdant knights followed the route you mentioned and discovered the wreckage of the whistling flames ship. unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo.
waeur"well then! if it wasn't lyney who committed the crimes, then who was it?
that's right. both mercenaries and warriors heavily rely on muscle memory. only knowing the theory of battle won't get you anywhere.
and since the spirit is susceptible to erosion, she placed her consciousness inside her sword, where she remains in a meditative state, free from all disturbances.
i saw some memory fragments drifting outside the window, and i intend to salvage them.
yeah. i'm acting as everyone's representative, so i'll need to act brave, even if i won't feel like it.
as for what the commission was about i guess some outlanders who were visiting sumeru wanted to visit the desert and see these lakes for themselves.
precisely! heh and i'm not even the hydro archon anymore, so all my power is gone anyway.
by the way, there's really no point in trying to hide the way you feel.
i'm afraid that it might've all become a mess during my absence.
but there is no urgency. to reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
in other words, something big must have happened in fyxestroll garden for them to show up.
you heard it right. the ones responsible for the corruption in the alchemy commission are not just the remnants of the disciples of sanctus medicus, but even the divine foresight himself.
uh an emergency response plan?
hold your horses, cowboy. it's for those to decide.
the express travels to so many worlds, it's hard to avoid running into difficult situations. having more skills can give you more protection.
for my brother, orders are more important than anything. even if you stuck bronya's letter to his forehead, he wouldn't be swayed.
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
i'll be in the crowd, cheering you on. remember to give it your all, and most importantly -- have fun!
gamblers always place their bets on the next dice roll but the bankers always have the last laugh, and they never touch a single die.
and its story won't end here. in the future, many more people will come to the theater and receive its blessing.
past the reception hall, you'll find the general hall -- the museum's largest exhibition room.
our xianzhou forbears knew this well, and that's why they entrusted the duty of guarding the roots of the arbor to the vidyadhara. however, the vidyadhara are still only mortal beings.
you are the one who organized the plans for this release party. in other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. so please, show some confidence.
it was all a premeditated trap to stir up chaos on the space station!
when everyone's rested and ready, let's go through the leads. time to find another heliobus.
i, uh i can't comment on that. i was just ordered to rescue the civilians actually, i have no idea either. anyway, you two just need to come with me.
i'm certain pascal won't do anything to harm anyone, but if something goes wrong
this was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
hmm why don't you take a guess?
after a moment, he lowers his hands and stands back up. his gaze shifts to fixate on your group, but he does not move from his place at the king's side.
remember, your first instinct is very important.
if we walk through here, we'll be able to see the wardance's official venue.
of course, after all, she was a landau!
so, i believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
just listen to your gut -- you were the one who said that... the remembrance doesn't lie.
i'm on duty. let's catch up later.
"doesn't have a lot of mora to his name" okay, let's keep going.
uh you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you
he was, but not anymore.
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
it's sanhaj kompore
every piece of the jade chamber, from the stone walls and wooden beams down to the smallest ornament, contributed to its total weight.
um, i mean, who is this knight?
but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
let me be clear about this: i did not mishear, nor is the wayob mistaken! we would never jest about something like this.
oh? my, you've been busier than i thought.
you wanna know what happens to people who vandalize exhibits? i call the silvermane guards and they carry you away!
leave it to me. stick close guys, and don't get spotted.
mingxi, please ready your statement.
the fatui are dishonest, but they wouldn't go as far as to start an open war. their opposition wouldn't just be mondstadt alone
interesting. your expression reminds me of my subordinates when they are giving a report.
well, is that all you've got to say while your life is at stake? that's hardly worth anything.
i am focalors. the eyes of countless fontainians are upon me. i must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
if you're interested, go pay her a visit. you may be just the help she needs.
but with you by my side, we will emerge victorious. let's go!
but you'll have to promise me one thing: you'll never steal other people's things again. promise?
actually, i don't think i agree. master diviner, let's reset the sandbox and give it another go, shall we?
to make sure these ten boxes fit within one another, i had to meticulously measure them -- it would've been a bust if i was off by even one millimeter!
i'm sure some people here see the idea of someone coming to poisson dressed as the hydro archon as extremely disrespectful.
you're right. if igor could see how impressive you are on the wardance stage, he would definitely be very proud.
unlike the outside world, what inazuma seeks is eternity. in other words, a state of tranquility, where very little ever changes.
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details
is there a room in this inn for storing books? and if there is, do any of them mention the stove god?
hmm? hmph! aaeur"are you not afraid? might i remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
you should not mention this name it has been a forbidden word for a long time.
so far, so good. a classic tale. what happened after that?
observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
in most matters, i would say no. but when dealing with heliobi i think the answer is quite clear.
some people are born with unparalleled foresight and exceptional intelligence but make the most ill-advised choices at destiny's crossroads.
i've heard that many places in the galaxy that partnered with the ipc have become popular areas for interstellar trade.
still, the outcome is uncertain. shouting loud doesn't necessarily carry any weight. what about the phone call i asked you to make, topaz?
uh, let me ask you one more question do you know the person in the coffin?
you two being there would be the best gift of all! it'll also be a good time to introduce you to the rest of the theater.
i see has mister svarog ever witnessed a similar incident anywhere in the network?
far as i know, the kind of incense you just mentioned is only popular beyond the wall.
(good, he's said what he said. the next argument could decide this debate.)
jeez, you sure do love to procrastinate.
maybe they're also waiting for the express to arrive. you guys really carry a lot of weight on your shoulders, don't you?
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh
you wanna hear a story? alright, alright. sit here, and i shall tell you the story i'm most proud of aeur" the story of the naganohara family! you'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?
this tie is a piece of evidence, right?
hehe, come on, it isn't that difficult.
sink deeper and do this once more. submerge your wrists in the spirit water. familiarize yourself with its temperature, its touch
gently push the peaches away there. and that's how you chase the jitterbugs away.
even trouble makers hogging the photo board. all minor incidents, but it all adds up to create of lot of work for a lot of people.
what about the soldiers who gave their lives on the front line, or the hardship endured by the people? do they deserve no mention!?
but i still feel like it'll be an uphill battle. i need to be calmer, cooler, and more collected.
when you say "protect," you're referring to their sanctimonious arrogance, aren't you?
i expect they still hold a grudge against me to this day.
i know when danger will come and what form it will take. don't worry, together we can do this -- no harm will come to you.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
so, this is where you heard the lord of the night? guess that means she really has awakened
mm-hmm! so, you are gonna let us in now? we need to talk to mister norbert about some important business-related matters.
when i held your hand just now, i could sense that you've got a great affinity for phlogiston. you're extraordinarily gifted.
it's an ancient tree -- we call it the ambrosial arbor. it was once the xianzhou luofu's prized treasure.
i knew there was a workshop in this town, so i wanted to try my luck here. i found all the components i need, but then i ran into a monster
all farewells in this world are sorrowful, lord gnaeus.
if you want to give me a sword, just say the word, grandpa. no need to beat around the bush.
the starskiff is ready for the ceremony now. everyone, please place your objects aboard the starskiff.
wah wah wah so annoying.
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
what are you trying to do, traveler? provoking a god in front of her people?
it must be difficult for asta. being the lead researcher isn't easy.
keep your cool, second mirror. what did they say this time? play it again for me.
shh! don't distract me when i'm checking the puppet's parameters. #twenty-seven fifty-seven
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
to be clear, i have no intention to hide that which i do out of reverence alone. but there is one thing you must be corrected on.
it's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. the desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
just press the button when you're at your wit's end. and of course, feel free to reach out to me for my "hospice care" too!
it is only upon reclaiming all coreflames that the miracle of genesis can reveal itself, granting a new lease on life to this broken world.
all the signs point to one thing aeur" a truly devastating battle just took place here.
have i not made myself clear? you're barking up the wrong tree. i don't want this job, nor do i know of anyone else who would.
y'know we're pretty good at turning a happy reunion into a tear fest. let's call it a day and give them some room.
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination
in business, everything comes down to profits versus losses. you have to keep a cool head and make rational judgments. in other words, you must be shrewd.
phonographs...they use vinyl records, right? there's only a handful of folks on the space station who collect those things.
in any case the sight of mora has always had a way of improving my mood, no matter what the sum is.
to make this tea party even more lively, i've invited someone else to join us today
the person you're talking about -- are they in charge of the people in black?
what matters is that i made a brief and inconsequential visit, and your first reaction was to immediately arrange a sizable surveillance operation with myself as the target.
oh you brave and fearless trailblazers, you benevolent nameless, can you really remain indifferent to that?
i was scared of someone recognizing me for who i truly was, and exposing the secret i swore to protect.
finally, we have lady bailu of the alchemy commission. she loves excitement.
did you ingest the brumedew concentrate pellet i gave you?
the ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. this is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
wouldn't i be taking up your time, though? i doubt this was in your schedule
just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the xianzhou artisanship commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to get them to operate according to a certain intention.
you allow yourself to be led away by guards surrounding you on both sides.
but unfortunately, you probably didn't learn much from those conversations. it seems we have no other choice but to find more people to talk to.
lord gnaeus what do you intend to do?
don't be afraid, i've dealt with those robots before. let's go!
please let me activate the mechanism before we all move forward, and please watch your steps.
after the decision is made, if you could please shred any documentation that accumulates on the wall during the process.
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
i know. if i hadn't joined in that plan with you, i wouldn't have come up with this idea.
not exactly i was thinking that you would be involved in the decision itself.
but your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
but what about those simply struggling for survival, fighting for something better? i've witnessed their light on the front lines, in the underworld in places you have overlooked.
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
i agree that art should be enlightening, but we can't pursue that goal by creating complicated works.
tch, what's wrong with her? why would she let it go extinct?
it would probably work on neuvillette. he has a knack for picking out who had good intentions even when the outcomes were all terrible.
you know you're making a dangerous decision, right?
to prevent its resurgence, i made some minor modifications to your body -- or more specifically, your tail.
a fitting end to the tale of the departed -- one could not ask for a better farewell. go on, they're all here.
oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word i say.
screwllum will stay on the space station for a while longer. he and herta still have problems they need to solve. as for me, i'm leaving soon and won't bother with goodbyes.
but if you're seriously still insisting on turning a profit under these circumstances, i'm afraid you're beyond redemption.
i told you, i was only just transferred here from the yaoqing. i don't come here very often.
march, may your blade be sharp and your victory glorious.
that's what i really meant when i said i'm no good at maintaining relationships.
my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
ah, i see. well, that can be fixed. i'll just have the yashiro commission order a few hundred cups and go door-to-door delivering them.
not long ago, i took on an assignment to clear out some nearby treasure hoarders.
yes. though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the ley lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
it's not every day we get this kind of opportunity. lyney thought it might be fun to spend some time in liyue, especially since it's lantern rite season.
yes. she is the memokeeper i mentioned.
becoming a swordmaster in a mere fifteen days is quite challenging.
is that really necessary?
if a space telescope were deployed at this location on the express, it would almost certainly be possible to observe shorter wavelengths...
"omni" makes it sound pretty capable, but the corporation released other models onto the market first. know why?
*sigh* there are many types of friend she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
rehearsals are exhausting if you keep your nose to the grindstone, you're going to wipe yourself out sooner or later.
i've been here many times in my life, but the scenery can never fully reveal itself to me.
there's no rush. let's see what they've got, and if you're still unsure, we can help you decide.
chief oleg he didn't say much, but i know he's not the kind to wear his heart on his sleeve.
is this the friend that you mentioned? luka? pleased to finally meet you. i keep seeing you in the news! my name is qingque, a diviner from the divination commission.
the vagrants say that the parts they worked so hard to obtain have completely vanished. they're worried that there's a thief in the camp
nice story. but what's it got to do with chasing lady bailu?
the module used to detect emotions was frequently damaged, eventually turning him into a small robot that did nothing but collect parts.
he doesn't know me and he doesn't know what the lawrence name means to people in mondstadt.
ei seeks eternity. to her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
no, we'll still need to tail him. but first, we need to do some groundwork.
anyway, thank you both. i'll remember your words of encouragement, and do my best.
still, i suppose i should keep on helping everyone, i am the epitome of "joy, kindness, and goodness," after all.
you're welcome. please take care of yourself!
yes. that's where the main force of the silvermane guards is stationed. they've consolidated their position there in order to resist the encroaching fragmentum.
(you didn't even take cooking as one of your skill proficiencies!)
only a hunter who is a true expert at subduing their prey can snare it without harming it. the line that divides life and death is often exceedingly thin.
hmm what kind of dessert should i try next?
allow me to take the investigation matters from here. you needn't worry any longer.
i must continue forward just a few more steps and i'll be able to see droidhead!
hmm? i'm great.
the astral express just received an invitation to the planet of festivities
until then, let's continue our game. it's my turn again.
lyney did not need to take part in the dissolution of the young woman at all. indeed, he did leave the scene via the vent.
i cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
i heard that they found an antimatter legion bomb, and the entire luofu needs to be locked down for safety's sake. they'll only re-open after they've removed the bomb i don't know if that's true.
what's up here? some kind of toy?
really? then the next time we meet, i'll bring some fireworks for us to launch together! it'll be fun!
the tenryou commission is experiencing a large turnover of personnel in very difficult circumstances. we really are short on people. i apologize for not having tended to your friend's request on time.
mister svarog, let's get started
"guard the border between life and death" this is wangsheng funeral parlor's most important responsibility. and i'm stricter than most
you rather sealed my fate there, with your "special thanks" at the end of the show.
the call is yours. we still have time to re-shoot an ending if that's what you'd like.
you'd make sure that i didn't notice anything amiss, before revealing yourself as my prosecutor once we'd arrived onto the stage
now, we just need to see where your fate no, "our fate" leads us.
the future is like a labyrinth: every divergence is merely an inducement. there is only one real path.
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps
you are unduly concerned. i'm simply conserving my energy.
i'm not investigating them due to any bitter feelings i still have towards my father. i just want to protect those that are close to me.
it would be shameful if i didn't at least recognize this much.
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
hmph, you still don't get it, do you? even now.
yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
miss sparkle also used it to attack mister shamari.
they'd run away as soon as they saw me, or they'd be shaking with nerves and unable to speak.
if our shows are too difficult to understand or too removed from everyday life, nobody would watch them anymore
oh? you look fine to me. sorry, i need to prioritize the wounded. there have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days -- many people are injured.
you are a very lucky person, you know. you get to sit in on this lunch for free.
besides, you'll be at the meeting! if any problems do pop up, you'll have no problem navigating them.
you may not have the courage to challenge me, but i trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
but seriously, i'm not about to cheerlead for someone attacking an inanimate object. that's just embarrassing.
as the newly appointed cauldron master, there's been much to take care of within the alchemy commission. it's only now that i've had the chance to speak with you. please forgive the delay, elder.
i've heard that the crew's senior members are extremely skilled. dan heng is already the express' guard, and the conductor the conductor is too cute to ask to train!
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
i'd like to hold this ceremony as a way of distancing the memory of tingyun from the lord ravager who tarnished her identity.
well then, i'm glad you learned something. you're already halfway toward mastering aristocratic conduct.
i only lost because i was duped by her little tricks.
quite a downpour nothing will get done until it clears. let this be a lesson to those who yesterday said, "i'll do it tomorrow."
could it have something to do with that clockie that only you can see?
the moment i saw the name "sangonomiya" on the list of competitors, i anticipated that she would make it into the finals to face the almighty shogun.
i gave you the sword back then because i didn't want our friendship to end.
how about i show you around the orphanage a bit more? unlike you, my memories from when i was little are crystal clear.
the tenryou commission has a responsibility to ensure public order and security during the irodori festival. if anything comes up, come to me.
i did, and that would be a good way to go about it. if they're realistic enough, animals of the same kind will follow them all the way to the trap.
it doesn't? looks like miss sparkle is more careful than i thought.
the alliance has been trying to root out their secret organization for millennia -- it's no coincidence that they've chosen this moment to reveal themselves.
and i finally got wind of your movements when you were on the way to wangshu inn.
i would never do such a thing. there was an important matter that required my attention.
brother and sister landau? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be
though i feel that idyia was not intentionally trying to hide anything from us, this domain does have plenty of secrets. i'm sure you've sensed that, too.
before the ground started shaking, i heard the sound of machinery. i believe there may be an immense mechanical structure under this region of the ocean.
since we're in a dream, let's make this final dance of sabzeruz as beautiful as we can!
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
who are those two little guys?
it's okay, mister svarog and i can come up with a solution.
but i chose to obey the shogun. for as long as she leads the way, who among us is qualified to judge between right and wrong when we have not yet reached the end of the path?
your excellency i've yet to finish the defense arrangements for the irodori festival. please excuse me.
yeah. she said, "dance is an art born from toil. it isn't a gift from the gods, but a creation by our own hands."
they're all just *burning* remembrances a stark contrast to this deep sea.
you guys you're not cloud knights acting as borisin, are you?
where else? you think we'd leave you on svarog's turf?
if only there was a way for me to preserve this moment and show it to the kids back home.
c'est la vie indeed! alas, i am forced to watch on helplessly as a more brave and seasoned adventurer than i swoops in to save the day.
i'm starting to feel like something else is at play here. i think i'll pay a visit to his house and see if i can find any clues.
that's why the marshal decided to imprison hoolay in the luofu. it wasn't an honor but rather a warning.
good. then we'll see you both at the sabzeruz festival.
should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
i'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
be it my duties as her heir, or a silvermane guard, i must face my problems head-on. even if
that tinge of regret i sense ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories i cherish.
unsheathe your swords and get ready, miss march! the duel starts now!
you speak too highly of us, welt. the stellaron hunters are merely destiny's slaves.
it put me in a certain mood aeur" similar to the one i felt during my training in jueyun karst, in fact.
hello, sir! is there anything i can do to help you?
that will do. i will have the okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
it's my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.
don't take svarog as an ordinary robot. he's, uh special.
and though i can still see that hill clearly in my memories, now it's been completely submerged.
elio ordered sam and me to find bladie and return with him. according to elio, bladie's swordplay and immortality have important uses. that's all i know.
the illustrious merlin's claw waiting for me, and for so long, too? it's quite an honor. it's been a while, general feixiao.
watch out for monsters. they like to hide. if you need to, clear the area before you dig for the supplies.
(now that i think about it, it's a good thing i found some helpers this time. some things are best done with the help of friends.)
responding to egeria's call, a number of warriors followed cassiodor into battle against the monsters. this group of warriors, under cassiodor's leadership, became known as the marechaussee hunters.
just remember to come back often. make an appointment in advance with asta or arlan so i can make time to study you.
captain huohuo, should we start the ghost hunt now?
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
from the exam results, it looks like there's nothing wrong with your brain. mister luka, have you been eating anything unusual lately?
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
oh that i was obviously joking.
i'm relieved to know that you're safe and sound. well then, since you and elder huaiyan are here, i imagine you must have received orders from the marshal?
since the culprit's trying to be cautious and low-risk, i'll bet they left through an area with some vegetation for cover aeur" but not so much that it would slow them down.
when the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
i understand how you feel, navia, but we have to change venues for the next part of the story, anyway.
looks like i'll have to abort this prematurely again.
countless people exist in my memories, and i know one day, that will be my fate, too aeur" a memory living on in someone else's head.
i was lucky enough to be chosen by the alliance to come in and clean up all the old grime in the alchemy commission.
deshret's relics is composed of many smaller brigades like ayn al-ahmar. the relics' headquarters issues orders to all brigades under its control.
kremnos seems to be hosting a festival, where its victor can go on to have an audience with the ruler and be bestowed with honor. it's just as mister damionis described.
i worry about her wandering around on her own, and i want to know what's been on her mind lately.
could it be a challenge that requires us to use the hand of zagreus? let's get closer and find out.
hmph, showing your true colors now that your evil schemes have been exposed? they're calling for their fellow ape fiendlings. please take cover behind me!
once is an oversight, twice would be a grave error. i won't allow such things to happen again.
be it simple price negotiation or a full-blown trade war, momentum and bargaining chips are but minor factors. to win, you need to be first to find out what cards your opponent is holding.
does the maritime express run out of constellation metropole?
they must perform these extra measures in addition to their standard daily affairs. the only manpower they can muster during the festival would be the emergency response units.
i've briefly traveled with your companions and know their whereabouts, dan heng. please rest assured, your nameless companions are safe, but they need our help.
now i just need to take care of the confidentiality issues. hehe let's hope our friends from overseas can keep their mouths shut, for their own sakes.
well, since we're already caught in the rain, we might as well enjoy it! saves us the energy of running for shelter, at least.
yes this is where we put an end to it all
stay still, benefactors my instinct tells me something's not right here.
i have my own ways. that's all you need to know.
cirrus may come across as hot-headed and impulsive, but under the surface they are actually full of guile
that sounds like too cruel of an ending to me. and perhaps a little irresponsible to present to the audience.
we've been disconnected from the rest of the universe for far too long, but i really believe the festival could be our chance to reconnect with other worlds again. it's important as a host that i make all guests feel welcome.
oh, by the way aeur" since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
naturally. i've dealt with similar issues hundreds of times. give me a moment to consider the best approach in this scenario
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
i see but that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
progress was really slow, but they managed to hunt down some new clues.
"stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation" what a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it
and we're done. i hope that you like it.
i didn't know there were so many great and mysterious beings in the universe it goes to show just how tiny and fragile we really are.
it's a grassroots organization. think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
pela's got a lot on her plate -- plus she also does volunteer work on the weekends sometimes. that's why we usually schedule mechanical fever's rehearsals at night.
we wandered around aimlessly for a while until we ran into director hu. she'd lit some incense and was burning fetor left and right with a flaming staff.
you want to go against me? fine, challenge accepted.
energy restored system online certification enabled come on, come on!
since i'm just an ordinary person now. they'll probably just laugh in my face if i go asking them for help
the inauguration ceremony went very smoothly. i didn't expect so many underworlders to come and listen to the address.
i'm afraid it's not that simple. the stolen goods will have to be kept as evidence at the police station for some time. they will not be available for purchase in the immediate future.
metaphorically speaking, they are like moths to a flame but that flame is the thoughts of sentient beings.
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
consider this aeur" no one will lose their life on account of having their vision taken away
that's it! the thing shaped like a giant iron ball.
lord gnaeus, before we move on there is something we must explain to you.
nope. mister zubayr's really on top of everything.
me? hmm if this was before, i could have simply asked clorinde. but it's already been some time since i last talked to her.
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
if you're interested, i can give you a referral. that should give you a forty% discount on membership fees.
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
but this girl once had an aranara as her best friend, and they haven't met in a very long time.
once you are ready, please assemble here, and we'll head over on the boat together.
oh wow, the train carriages are so cool. can we put a little stage there?
on any other day, i would want nothing to do with them. unfortunately though, the brigade that's stirring up trouble now is none other than dakan al-ahmar.
i wonder how their relationship is now.
but i'd like to keep a closer eye on it for a while. compatibility tests should take a few days. hopefully, it will be all back to normal by then.
also, not all of them are bad people everyone just wants to survive.
i didn't realize that one as skilled as diviner fu would also be susceptible to the power of the heliobi.
good luck. you'll have to tell me how everything turns out the next time we meet.
glad to meet you, too. are you here to participate in the wardance?
let's play truth and lies!
and the atmosphere here is completely different from the previous two scenes.
whew, i'm getting sleepy myself. see you tomorrow. remember to wake me up on time
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
haha, don't drink too much, or you won't be able to sleep tonight.
there's a bunch of crates piled over there. maybe we can find what we're looking for.
dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. you make it sound like i'm some sort of wicked witch.
work is always exhausting. i've run out of chit-chat for today. come back tomorrow to talk about collaboration.
i've seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. and you're no different.
simultaneously, it might also strengthen their bonds with phainon and castorice.
when the abyss first began to corrode the ley lines, they took every opening they could get.
why is this place so full of junk? are you the kind of people who never throw away the box when you buy something, 'cause you're worried you won't be able to return it without the original packaging?
in the meantime, do you think you could head out and look for more clues? we can compare notes when you're done - i'm counting on you!
and you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
curious about my eyesight? well, i'm not blind. on the contrary, i can see much more than the typical person.
would you like to play on "easy mode," or "authentic mode"?
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
some clients are behind on their payments again, and a few of the guys got themselves into trouble during their last job i'm not the boss, but somehow everything ends up being my problem
uhh you're even asking diting?
for example, when greeting a friend, you could say: "as the morning dew greets the coming dawn, so do i greet you, my dear friend."
alright, the ball's back to you aeur" catch! i want to hear about your experiences and the people you've met.
my dear citizens, my loyal audience, allow me to present my reasoning and bring this performance to a swift close.
i see it too -- let's go.
okay. i need forty portions of knights' special northern smoked chicken, and forty of favonius-favored pile 'em up
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan
i didn't steal the sword.
*sigh* looks like we're gonna to have to resort to unconventional methods. are you gonna come with us willingly, or do i have to ask the guy behind me to carry you in his white death-box?
that's okay, mister wheel. we're trying to get to the city as fast as possible. we just need you to get us across the sea. in your capable hands, i'm sure we'll get there in no time!
of course not! what were you thinking?
unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme she was completely lost in the memory zone.
besides, i'm sure i could master dishes like "la lettre a focalors" or "blubber profiteroles" in no time. if i felt so inclined.
oh, what's the difference between the two?
but how about you? would you be interested in visiting inazuma?
honorary knight! paimon! what are you two doing here?
these thousands of years have naturally turned into memories of mine.
well, you've only been practicing swordplay for fifteen days. to even reach this point is already impressive.
ah yeah, delavar the "scar-riddled bandit," engur the "wide-eyed butcher," and jabari the "ducktail-bearded crook." the whole lot of 'em are known around these parts.
i mean after all, the only thing we can control right now is our choice at this very moment.
however, the three questions i posed earlier were not just for the nameless, but for you too, general jing yuan.
now we just need to find all the malfunctioning robots and retrieve the sculpture pieces one by one.
i doubt the underground will ever see it fully excavated
amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. take a rest if you need one. don't put too much pressure on yourself.
(i--it kinda works, right?)
not exactly. actually, we--
but at least i can say that i no longer desire to play any new roles.
okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands
if i'm not here to help i don't know what might happen in the next wave.
the heater you saw is just a standard geomarrow radiator. they may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
a great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the yae publishing house's ace in the hole. and i would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
i have worked in every post in the sky-faring commission from maintenance to pilot, combat reserves to stargazer such a long time has gone by so quickly.
just as you begin to celebrate your victory, a suspicious lump on the ground catches your attention.
this design is a step down from the adepti's original guizhong ballista in terms of firing speed and power, but the good thing about it is that it can be mass-produced.
don't tell me you thought even i had been blindsided by the oratrice's result?
little layla here breezed through her first battle, souka won hers by a hair's breadth but mine was rather disappointing. my opponent was a frightful bore.
why'd you come find me out of the blue? miss me?
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
oh, your master ahem, your father, i mean, never talked about it? it was a kind of monster that was active several centuries ago.
the real dunyarzad? where? and who are you talking to?
apparently, they used to be good friends well, good friends who were bad for each other. bladie forgot nearly everything, so he doesn't remember it well.
hmm can i see this pom-pom? sounds like a talking teddy bear to me.
you may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. i thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
when that fragrant ink is burned, this is the exact odor that it leaves behind
they are also followers of qlipoth, but what they do is drastically different from us architects. can businessmen honestly support the preservation? i'm seriously doubting their true motives
of course. i've heard that most humans like desserts, so it's not unusual that i should enjoy them too. miko agrees with me on this.
of course! everyone in natlan is rooting for you.
a simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. it even allows me to verify my own existence.
that's why i told them we were here for urgent maintenance! the front line equipment needs servicing just as much as the rest.
i always get people asking me how my workshop makes money when it's not trading. use your brain! it doesn't!
i had no idea what to say, i didn't know if i should object or just follow along
anyway, don't dwell on names. as long as the machine works, what does it matter whether it's a "jade abacus" or a "computer"?
seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist... humans traverse the path of fate.
stargazer navalia is governed by the artisanship commission -- it took me a while to sort out our paperwork. i got a sense of the situation on my way back.
allow me to eliminate these obstacles, dragon lady stand back, the chill of my sword freezes everything in its path.
but, most of the time, having the ability to perceive souls means watching them wither away in agony, completely powerless to stop it
after all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. it would be a pleasure to train with you.
hmph. so you do recognize me, then.
haha, i knew i could count on you!
anyway, for a mortal to be able to repair an adepti mechanism is quite the mystery, even to the qixing.
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
the snow have you ever seen such beauty?
hehe, i hope i'll actually be able to get some sleep over the next two nights.
and not only do you have belobog music, but music from other planets, too
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
that's why i was sent here -- to reassure them.
hmm i give it a nine point eight!
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
all the miners here huddled together anyone else getting deja vu?
i don't think he has quite grasped the nature of this situation.
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
then, i'll head back for now. i think i need some time to fully digest everything that just happened.
"take a photo"? once again, i'm faced with a combination of words that makes absolutely no sense to me.
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
the club introduced a completely new kind of gameplay for this script.
oh? it appears that you have more skill than i thought.
traveler, it seems liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. do you miss it here?
besides, being a leader is hard. it wasn't the right job for me.
if i make an exception to the rule now, i'm just leaving a backdoor for myself. which would be the same as not having a boundary in the first place.
it's simple. that stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
your voice echoes through the dark hall, but the only response you receive is the sound of water dripping from the ceiling.
mister svarog, i still want to help you check a few other modules turn around a little.
merchants already have enough challenges to deal with, and as paimon explained, my help was unconditional. please, sell your wares to me at the price you would sell them to any other customer.
sure, i'd be happy to do that for you.
there is no need to rush. take your time organizing your things. i will wait for you all here.
you witnessed human memories leaking from the ley lines, didn't you? well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
thank you, everyone. this really means so much to me.
everything i have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
oh please, spare me that look. i didn't sign up for any of this. i'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me
the resurrection of king deshret? first i've heard of it
i also enjoyed aeval's introductions to fontaine along the way. everything you described was so clear and detailed that we can't help but want to hear more.
(a shame? i mean, if you ever miss this whole telepathy mess, i could always share my senses with you again.)
hmm? what's wrong? just adjust the focal length a bit.
she had their utmost trust, admiration, and love and she truly deserved it.
(next up i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
ah, one more thing please, if you have a heart, don't make it spicy.
its original owner was an ancestor of the landau family -- rhonda landau. she was one of our great heroes who participated in the defense of belobog seven hundred years ago.
what i mean is that you don't require medication. just stroll around the luofu more and take in the barrage of new sights and sounds. stop drinking sweet dreams soda and your symptoms will disappear in a few days.
leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken penacony from this dream.
a familiar flavor acceptable.
yeah, exactly. he's young and talented.
even though they look all bright and colorful, they're still stones, right? aren't you all looking for these kinds of stones?
the one who hired you to come to penacony probably doesn't want you secretly linking up with other forces, right?
"to the honorable and trustworthy marechaussee hunters: our kingdom is currently facing a grave crisis."
are you still thinking about the past, lord phainon?
whoa she sounds like a big deal.
the complex locality of this world has been affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
yes, no need to try and understand it. let me put this simply: right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
the fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise they would have been purged long ago.
yeah, she probably would've snuck away as well if i didn't drag her back.
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
whoever this person is clearly enjoys hard liquor and has a very high status aeur" hence the need for expensive-looking wineware.
hehe, to be honest, even though i've thought about it countless times before, i still haven't found an answer.
outlanders, why have you come to amphoreus?
we have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times it's hard to tell from just a few words on the internet.
the shogun's army might as well just be me!
i'll go over the newly-arrived supplies with you later, mister snezhevich. we should be able to finish the preparatory work today.
if hoolay does come to attack the skysplitter lieutenant yanqing, i need you to hold him there until i am able to arrive.
ahem! you there, lowly laborer. you stand in the presence of a member of the illustrious lawrence clan. i have words for you.
the crowd never gets tired, do they?
if you can't offer an explanation, i'm afraid these cloud knights will have to escort you out.
in contrast, zhiyi is evenly balanced across the board, and enjoys an excellent reputation in liyue.
you want to come as well? but you look quite tired.
not a lot of people out there could've fought the mara-struck like you did. i'm only a civil servant -- i can't imagine what kafka would do to me if i were caught in the fray
ms. rekhar has gone through a lot in her life, but she told us that she's very happy to live at the theater now.
yes, we do. still, the artisanship commission is filled with security mechanisms. even the general won't be able to save us in time if we get trapped.
i see. thank you for your valuable insights.
not even that. the lord of the night knows the ley lines better than anyone. i'm sure she knew of your victory before us all.
scared? no, i just don't want to see her disappointed.
i could tell that although neither of us acknowledged it, we both knew that the road ahead would likely end in tragedy.
so this set is going to be a part of the script?
oh, it's you. it seems your investigation went well.
speaking of stories, you've reminded me that now is not the time for them. moze, we've sent the "warning" from stargazer navalia. what's the situation on your end?
i don't understand not a single word about the resistance, sangonomiya, or the situation on the front line
a response that lacks embellishment. you have no misgivings about the friction or suspicion that your answer might cause. a step will not be recorded.
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
when ruan mei visited the luofu earlier, she mentioned what happened to you. this coincided with when the message sent by the astral express arrived.
that's normal! i can't remember mine sometimes either.
not exactly aeur" it's not so much that one's more powerful than the other ugh, but never mind, that's not important. it would take too much time to explain.
whoa, whoa, hold your horses. chief oleg wanted us to come and cheer for you, he didn't say anything about becoming your sparring partners.
thanks to the "favor" of the lord ravager, i've become a player in this game.
never mind. just don't look so lost when we're in class later, or you might just sleep yourself to dreamflux reef.
elio can help me, if i follow his instructions.
you may as well come clean. you know i will not turn a blind eye to any violation of the rules in liyue harbor.
this looks like a mine.
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
they're already awake in their rooms. will you be comfortable in following me now? time waits for no one. we must hurry to the lobby.
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek do you get it?
oh, it's not for me. i lost a bet with wriothesley, and now i have to buy him something.
they will soon realize the situation. when old oti answered the last question, he represented more than just the alfalfa family.
actually, i'm well aware of my own limits. if it weren't for yanqing resisting that heliobus, maybe i wouldn't have been able to hold on until you brought reinforcements.
you aren't getting any funny ideas, are you?
and anyway, to your point about collaboration you've been helping out too, right?
these memory fragments are as fine as dust, and can't form memory bubbles. they're hard to see with the naked eye -- even most memokeepers can't sense them.
but it's dangerous around here. we'd better travel together.
i've never visited a place filled with such vitality and happiness
i looked everywhere and couldn't find him, so i checked the security department's work plan records. this is what i found!
the discomfort i was experiencing earlier was caused by the shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
yae publishing house has released numerous works that lay out military strategy in a simple and pragmatic way. those are my favorite.
oh! the windblume ceremony is about to begin. windblume star, have you chosen your windblume?
no problem. i will let you try it out as soon as i finish the prototype.
i want to do something special for you in return for all the help you've given me.
ah, i heard something about that, too. apparently it's a cart that goes zipping along a "terrifying" course at an "uncontrollable" speed
the hacker was skillful and even taunted us with her seal. her name is silver wolf, a member of the stellaron hunters
though we're just tiny people compared to the divine, we still have to do our best to make sure that the birthday girl feels loved on her special day.
the next item has to do with the movement of people and military authority.
the truth is we are on the same side.
at this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire asdana system.
for our next stop, i'd like to take you both for a meal.
that girl doesn't talk much, but i know she doesn't see us as her enemy.
if there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. i'm always happy to listen to other people's problems who knows, i might even try to help you come up with a solution.
rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
and now that the gods have given me their blessing it actually feels more like i'm finally able to take my fate in my own hands.
need to take stock? just say the word -- we'll head over together.
i was just teasing, but she gave it some serious thought, nodded, and really hit the ground running after that it's like my joke lit a fire under her or something.
traveler, paimon, please accept my sincerest apologies for delaying your meal.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
when the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the grand narukami shrine. once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
have we drafted a new patrol map? please give me a copy and i'll look it over when i have time.
did they really think that as long as they didn't do any of that stuff right in front of me, i would never know?
seeing isn't always believing, and if you can't trust your eyes, you certainly can't trust rumors.
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? good. we are running out of time, so let's get moving! chop chop!
great! then let me give you a demonstration first.
you misunderstand. if you were in my shoes right now, wouldn't you want to keep your guard up~?
oh? such a hasty refusal. do you think that's wise? goodness, who knows what tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it
this feast is held in honor of each and every one of you gathered here today. i hope all of you get to relax and enjoy our hard-won victory.
you're just in time -- everyone is asking this ipc goon for an explanation!
a duty-bound soldier and a resistance leader it's hard to be rock 'n' roll in front of people like that.
oh, i can help with that. one moment.
patience, my friend. i will reveal the answer to you but that time is not now.
maybe i'll see you the next time danger beckons. until then, keep your wits about you a lot of people are watching you for a lot of reasons.
the storage zone you passed through contains all our inventory, and is the main research center.
sure but i may not be able to offer any practical advice if our topic of discussion is not work-related.
a long time has passed since i wielded this sword the heat of combat nearly cast me into the darkness.
he cast aside his physical form in order to etch the memories of rage and sadness deeper into his being.
unless you want to sleep in a cardboard box, i suggest prioritizing the renovation of your bedroom first.
i don't have to fight all of them right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan
yeah. every transaction before the last one was marked with an exact amount of mora. but the final one, where they paid for everything to be brought back to the desert was simply marked as "delivered."
so, you mean the ones who scoured the settlement for me were also from the spina
there's no need to use a vision in affairs that mora can solve. as far as affairs only a vision can solve go, i know of only one
nope. i've been here a while, and she still hasn't shown up.
worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.
if you don't have any plans in the immediate future, why not stay in mondstadt for a while? we'll be celebrating the weinlesefest very soon.
promise me to never tell the people of okhema about the worlds beyond the sky, no matter what may happen.
when this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
your appetite astounds me, but it seems you didn't eat anything that might affect your brain.
in your opinion, was the ministry of civil affairs' appraisal of mingbo at all exaggerated?
imbibitor lunae, if memories are returning to you, share them.
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
their weapons and automatons are much stronger than anything we have.
glad to be traveling with you again, miss black swan.
she'll be dancing for us from now on, so please give her your support.
hey, don't worry. i'll help you.
this is zandar. zandar one kuwabara. the first genius in history.
i get it. you don't think i have any special skills, so i'll just get in the way?
art doesn't discriminate, and it appeals to all. everyone has the right to appreciate art.
so much commotion. this must be an important meeting.
and that's precisely why i haven't been able to shake off this strange feeling in the days since i started traveling with you.
i heard it, too. let's investigate.
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
shards of a cloud knight's weapon. something really sharp caused this
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
i'm sorry if i'd known i wouldn't have got you to come with me. you'd probably be there by now if you'd gone by yourself
thank you. alright here it is aeur" i've always thought it would be fun to recapture what life was like before i joined the liyue qixing.
mister svarog chose not to get rid of it. isn't that the most convincing proof?
no no no, that's too much of a stretch. i cut all my ties with my father a long time ago. he has no control over my life anymore.
sincerely, beidou, you misunderstand me. i have many simple pleasures aeur" i take a stroll through yujing terrace and one down by the harbor every single day.
hmm, let's leave the slogan to mingxi. we should head to the next location.
i'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. unfortunately though it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
the theater provides money for ms. rekhar and her children, inspiration for mister khasani, and enjoyment for the people of the great bazaar.
they were different from most but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
it's a family heirloom, and probably has a history? my ma can swing it with just one hand, but i struggle even with two. ah
an abandoned orphan, a cursed little girl, the last descendant of the puppet clan... i can tailor it to the tastes of the individual~
the book glimpses into the beyond describes it as "living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown."
if we do not stop them now, they will pose a grave danger to the future generations of amphoreus.
don't be sad, mister stream! whenever i've forgotten important dance steps in the past, my friends at the grand bazaar always stick by my side to encourage me!
whenever i go for a stroll around mondstadt and see the citizens happy and free, i feel deeply inspired.
the boar's not a bad character, actually. he's the one who raises the little oceanid, yes?
technically, though the distinction is hardly relevant right now. this isn't a very formal patrol we're just chatting.
hehe, this is a pretty big ask~
mm don't give me that look. it's just a game after all, and having fun should be your main concern.
until today! the sweet smell on the express has awakened my memories, so
making the best of every single day and living life the way i want to -- those are the most important things to me.
oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
miss xinyan, please take this letter. enclosed is a travel permit that i processed personally for you.
not everyone's like you, chief. even the desert natives who abandoned their homes in the wilderness still wish to have a god of their own.
the feeling of creating your wealth with your own two hands is just as exhilarating as ever.
during the course of finding memories, a picture is worth a thousand words.
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work)
it's certainly looking that way. apparently, every soul in liyue is now living under the creeping shadow of death, but so far, we are the only ones in the know.
the item that's supposed to be in this exhibit is a modern sculpture called gears and wisdom.
your run-of-the-mill robots don't have a will of their own. their aim is merely svarog's aim.
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
right! why waste your time?
though i gotta say, uncle tian, you say you're into behind-the-scenes planning? my work's of the covert variety, too don't you think i might make a good tianshu?
just as what happened on the xianzhou yaoqing recently.
little miss pink what's that supposed to mean!?
ha, that's something i do know. it's an aurumaton -- they're service robots on the xianzhou.
good. now, there are two key points that aristocrats attach great importance to aeur" your manner of speech, and your bearing.
if one carries a blade, it's bound to be used to cut something down. my reason for drawing my sword -- past, present, or future -- remains singular.
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those
ha, a small fry like that monster can't hurt me.
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
many challenges still lie ahead for inazuma, but i am prepared for them.
matsuda, uchimura aeur" i understand that you're concerned for the safety of watatsumi island.
that's right, in the name of the family that you so dearly revere, uncle schubert.
don't look at me like that. i've never had to tinker with the shogun before, and she's very complicated. it's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
is that so well, i respect your choice.
not only that, putting spices supreme on the map would increase interest in the alley as a whole.
so you mean to say your father intended to die in the duelists' ring?
those unhappy experiences allowed you to really cherish your bonds with everyone, and also gave you the opportunity to become friends with us.
after all that i've done to reach you, droidhead you'd better not snub me.
as for the ancient name once we handle this crisis, i'll talk to xilonen right away. don't worry aeur" i never forget a promise to a friend.
descendant of the kujou clan. your turn.
we're friends of his. he's been telling us how impressed he is with the quality considering how affordable it was, so we just had to come and take a look for ourselves.
should be all clear now. let's poke around.
of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
it is also very quiet. i think i will be able to concentrate and get a lot of work done here.
besides, the madam helm master simply asked me to assist you in navigating around starskiff haven. it's no different to any other diplomatic mission or delegate reception.
i remember the kremnoans commissioned you to craft a divine object before. do you happen to recall the details?
but i don't want to alarm the public. can i trust you, honorable guard?
i'm just a healer, and i'm not familiar with the past. i'd appreciate it if you could enlighten me, general.
verification complete! congratulations on being this round's first winner, cyno!
something this important is beyond their jurisdiction. only the lord of the night can decide whether we can grant an ancient name to one who does not hail from our lands.
name your price. you deserve that much.
i understand.
yes, i've been preparing myself mentally for a long time. if i back out now, it'll be a huge loss.
i have gathered everyone here today to make an important announcement.
i think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
the situation is under control for now. the damage to our security system was minor. the intruder only managed to alter a small amount of data, so it was easy to fix.
certainly. pain is but common to a ninja and i shall never flinch in the face of it.
with the entire archipelago situated on a mechanical framework, it could be activated to raise each island from beneath the water.
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
"life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
where are the yaoqing messengers, and where's my sister? are they still alive?
i've heard people everywhere tell tales of your heroics, and i've seen it first-hand adventuring with you.
hehe, but no one remembers that once the celebration starts. it's not like he can't also have some fun himself.
when you order the wrong item or make too much of something, sometimes the best way to maximize the value of those goods is to give them away.
i hope serval's right that supreme lunatic better not have harmed bronya.
you do not wield your sword for yourself, but to protect those you serve. there's nothing special about a blade. it's the intentions of the wielder that matter above all else.
if you are unashamed of such disgraceful action, then you are also unworthy of the tenryou commission itself! do i make myself clear!?
parts of the surveillance system were destroyed when the legion invaded -- it still hasn't been fully repaired. maybe he took advantage of a blind spot.
but what really interests me is that many of his views happen to coincide with uncle tian's. having someone like zhiyi take the position would certainly put uncle tian's mind at rest.
this building, this playground equipment i've seen it all before.
it's only natural to want to escape when strict rules are being forced on you. i know there are a lot of grown-ups trying to control you -- telling you what you can and can't do they're the ones to blame.
at first glance, the weapons appear absolutely ordinary, but as you observe them, you notice a faint energy emanating from within.
still, when it comes to fighting on the front lines, you can put your life in his hands. there's a dozen of us in wildfire who are still in his debt not to mention ordinary underworlders.
do you mean you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
pascal's consciousness does not appear to have returned to the level shown in the diary
makes sense. we went crazy and couldn't control ourselves i like the way you think.
it won't be a problem. the fontaine-style dress from the novel shouldn't be too heavy, so it won't affect my abilities.
i can't say i blame you -- we're nothing alike in personality or interests.
the victor is clear. seems you require more practice.
what can i say sounds like a lynxy expedition alright.
shh listen to what the people around us are talking about. the conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
if i get the chance, i'd love to bring my telescope onto the express.
i'm just going to have a polite discussion with those two grown-ups about what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.
but if you still have doubts about ei, i would say they are misplaced.
miss fu xuan? is that you?
i'm just here to talk business. so, are you in business or not?
looks like we'll have to play this little game of sparkle's then.
in theory, yes. all you would need to do is survive the rigorous training, and master the swordsmanship techniques required to fight the monsters.
also, i'm fairly certain that hilichurls can't write stories. so does this author claim to be documenting hilichurl life from an outside perspective, perhaps?
the venue is right over there. why not go and take a walk around? oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.
he says that his responsibility is "preservation." to do that, he must make decisions that best protect humanity.
this guitar was actually given to me as a birthday present by cocolia a long time ago.
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza
it might mean the tables have turned.
you don't seem like you're too worried about anything, so my movement therapy won't be of much use. instead, i was thinking
understood, ninja hiryu aoi dan heng.
uh, hello there i hope we aren't interrupting your rehearsal.
if i'm putting my hopes in the wrong place, so be it. but for amphoreus, i am willing to take the chance.
merchants from all over will set up shop. there'll be tons of stuff to eat, use, and wear more than you can count!
i took a closer look, and the craftsmanship doesn't appear to resemble anything from this era. if i remember correctly, that style was last in vogue several hundred years ago.
this must be the result of pascal's meticulous repairs but the little fella doesn't really need the monitor, does he?
i wonder how many armories and arsenals there are on each of these planets
i'm sorry dunn time for a little nap.
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
makes sense to me, i agree. the akasha is not alive, and i don't think we can be completely controlled by something without a mind of its own.
the past and present of the sky-faring commission do not have such a simple relationship. the events of the past crafted its current greatness.
still, now that we know how bloodbranch coral works, i, as divine priestess of sangonomiya, may need to think of a new way to counteract the holy soil phenomenon.
if you would just think for a moment, it should be pretty obvious why we are here. yet now you're intentionally trying to provoke me?
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few it's just like a hidden message left by someone for the nameless.
but i sincerely advise that you cease this behavior immediately. it is liable to affect the fine you'll need to pay in the end.
but from now on, you should better attend to your duties. there's no need to keep kano nana worrying all the time.
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
i've decided to forge an exclusive mask for you!
there is a certain place with a freezing-cold climate where there's nothing but ice as far as the eye can see.
i see. you decided to admit to your feelings in an effort to bring me down with you
has it sparked an interest in the business world for you?
even so, keep your spirits up and try to be happy, okay? and try to smile more every day, just like i'm doing now.
this is precisely why when entering the plane of euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
oh, i just love the atmosphere. it feels like one big, happy family.
here. have a taste of my cooking.
therefore, you could say that you are a one-of-a-kind stellaron vessel.
we'll turn the entire heliobi-hunting process into regular uploads. viewers will see that there's nothing that scary about it, and there won't be any public panic!
i'll be waiting off to the side. just let me know when you're done.
recite the incantation in your heart, little one. also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head aeur" a wish, for example.
it looks very happy. perhaps you could try petting it?
but, the gate didn't move an inch
kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
thank you for everything you've done for the sky-faring commission and the luofu. this small seal is the foundation of the xianzhou's prosperity.
i had to keep all my feelings, all my curiosity about life to myself. no-one could be allowed to know
did mister svarog consider that for me? maybe i shouldn't disappoint him
who i am, where i'm from, my name it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
times are changing drastically, and people must adapt. i'm not the only one committed to making a difference, elder caenis.
the ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, i'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
hello, are you here for a bit of exalting sanctum scenery too?
anyway, sorry to get off topic, we're in a bit of a hurry! mister jut, did you say you didn't reserve enough food?
dango with milk hmm, i've never heard of it. what made you want to do this?
of course. this is a prototype designed by yae publishing house's top artist and crafted by the most skilled lacquerware master in inazuma city
jiangzhou was responsible for planning the lantern rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
oh, and there'll be a cameo for mister kamisato and miss yoimiya as well. they'll be used to show outsider perspectives on the fates of the two musketeers.
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
sorry for the wait! preparations for the celebration are finally done.
yes, you see things the way they are, however they may appear on the surface.
so, have you made your choice?
if you could see through the eyes of an adeptus, you wouldn't be so surprised.
"i bestow upon you the blessings of the forest, and offer you a home in this land"
his life became a light for so many, yet to others, it wasn't even worth remembering.
we go from here to the end of the path without leaving a speck of abomination behind us. the first one to the end wins.
general, this is an internal affair for the luofu
i'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
everyone at the grand bazaar loves lesser lord kusanali, and we're all looking forward to the sabzeruz festival.
at least we'll get to see some amazing scenery along the way, right? besides, we'll have each other. it'll be a shared experience that we'll never forget.
don't worry about it, my lady. i did say that i like mora. besides, that's our next topic of conversation.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
looks like we're the only ones in good spirits today
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
surely you don't think all that was "business development"!?
guuji yae, i'm a little curious aeur" does it not also dishonor the shogun to hide a wanted criminal at her grand shrine?
health is everything -- you won't be much use if you neglect yours. let wildfire take care of the furnace core for now. you head back and recuperate.
no, we don't want to cause you any trouble, of course.
hey, this is my job. the homayanis pay me, not you.
shall we roll some dice? whoever gets the lowest number gets to eat it.
here, these are your wages, as promised. not a single mora short.
oh, there you are. sorry, i got distracted watching the crowds.
i've never thought about leaving your theater, mister zubayr. i truly love this place, and i want to keep dancing here.
a man dressed in dark clothes, likely a minister, shields his mouth with his hands and bends down to whisper a few words to the king.
calm down, no need to panic. that's not why we're here.
besides, everyone knows that the main difference between a human and a god is the possession of "authority." gods can do what humans cannot aeur" that's why they're worshipped as gods.
(wait so, as long as you pass the check, you can pretty much do anything, and it won't be seen as absurd?)
what's the matter? are you unwilling to assist?
we've made it up till now i could lose an arm and a leg for all i care -- i have to lay eyes on the stellaron.
robin believed it was because the harmony had been tampered with somehow, but as far as i know, there aren't many entities capable of interfering with the power of paths.
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
i wonder what the old place is like now. maybe some things will still look familiar.
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
alright, here's the situation. recently, a nameless domain has appeared in the araumi region. monsters with incredible strength have been pouring into the area.
but for the knights of favonius, our priority is to deal with the aftermath of this attack.
you mean, the protection magic that stops them from coming to harm? we saw it in action.
at this time, cowell arrived in the tunnel, having heard that strange noise, and caught lyney red-handed.
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
(a pattern on a stone door that's something master mentioned before)
alright, next you should pay my uncle a visit. he has a small camp at the top of the mountain near springvale. he usually whiles his time away there when there's nothing else to do.
as a servant, loyalty to the shogun is my duty. and as a warrior, i dedicate my life to following the way of the shogun.
ugh why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
it's just as they say: each swordsman has their own unique style, and even the same swordsman can't make the same cut twice. it would be impossible to copy these marks.
need something else? isn't the seat of divine foresight anxious to learn about the prescription?
i have invited you two here as friends. and when friends come over to play, our enjoyment comes first, naturally.
then i'd have to disagree. that's impossible.
this time, let's try something a little more challenging.
but i'm here to protect you all, so please don't worry. come what may, i will face it head-on.
although you're friends with the traveler and yanfei, i'd still suggest you heed my warning.
personally, i think all these rumors are meaningless drivel. across the sea of stars, the divine foresight knows better than anyone else what happened on the luofu and the meaning behind it
someone once said to me: penacony wasn't like this a long time ago, nor should it be.
is there any place you'd like to go? i can accompany you, i've got time.
my blade will lead us through the shadows.
trianne will open the gate that will lead you to castrum kremnos. may the golden thread guide you on your journey and bring you safely home.
it's okay it's not like i even know what she looked like
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves
great, and it's barely damaged! nat wouldn't have expected her old supplies from years ago to have stayed in such good condition.
work has been busy and i shouldn't leave, but i wouldn't be able to stop worrying about klee.
all familiar names. dakan al-ahmar has been trading for a hefty supply of food, weapons, and medicine. it seems that in the past, they used to receive some canned knowledge as well.
i say "virtually" because of skott, of course lucky for us, he wasn't as smart as he thought he was.
the solution is right in your hand.
let me see slender fingers, but strong. this hand belongs to a killer.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
but he's not the only evil ninja in this realm, right?
this is my fault. if only i'd perceived what they were feeling earlier, it never would have come to this.
...when i saw this photo, when i saw you fighting alone just now...
it was the last time i spoke to caiyi.
i understand why you're trying to make her the hero of the story, but isn't she your hero already? after everything she did for you?
well? you may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
but there is a type of dream that we will never awaken from, and should never awaken from
that's right, be confident in your work. that's exactly how a light novelist should be.
heh heh, storytelling time is over!
following those clues, i was able to finally locate the missing fireworks. but there was no sign of treasure hoarders.
as for me, i'm gonna check the area for any unusual activity.
these guys are my assistants. we need to overhaul all the installations here.
hmm, i guess you're right maybe it isn't such a big deal.
let's put that aside for a second. traveler, what brings you here? were you looking for someone?
today's little excursion caused such a ruckus that every single bodyguard at the estate was deployed. it won't be easy to hide things from your old man.
never mind. it would seem the time has come for other means of dismantling the xianzhou from within
yes, of course. the best view should be from the jade chamber.
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
take all of our fungi and defeat her fair and square. force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
even though it has suffered fragmentum corrosion, this is still part of belobog. it was our home. the guards know this place like the back of their hand.
but let me make it clear: the alliance sent me here to handle the business impartially, not to choose sides.
out of everyone in the world, he is the one who trusts you the most. so much that he drank your fish soup without doubting you, not for one second.
i have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the tenryou commission at present. does this have anything to do with kujou kamaji?
but mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
well, i'm not a member of the club at all. clorinde simply woke me up first thing this morning, said there was a good script worth experiencing, and asked if i wanted in.
toys? they're not exactly toys
hah. what an alliance joke.
heh, it's quite understandable to be hungry for top talent.
demolition notices need to be provided in writing and made available to the public. otherwise, the theater can continue to operate as long as its license is valid.
come with me, ororon. we've got to find you a place to stay for the night.
that would make sense. i'm sure a lot of miners are injured, right? *sigh* if everyone could just get along, things would be easier
i had no idea it was your fiftieth anniversary. if i'd known, i would've made some extra-fancy fireworks, just for you.
a director is a kind of job. the one we're looking for is named zosimos.
this reminds me of a story that a retainer once told me several years ago.
we protect businesses, the ipc sacrifices them for their own gain.
are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
can a game like this really be relaxing? i'm not convinced it's conducive to work-life balance.
so you can try working together with others as well as long as you can see them, hehe.
in other words, even though i can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, i can still send you to where ei is.
stand aside, rookie. let me show you how we zhuming swordmasters treat their apprentices.
sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. he didn't say why. still, i'll wager it had something to do with him -- he's always tinkering with his devices.
lefton's suspicion level can be downgraded.
especially these days. not only do i have my light novels, but i've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
no, i'm not questioning your abilities. it's just that, i've never really seen you use a kamera before.
could the clearing of the fog be related to this device?
don't think you can deceive me with some poetic speech! there is no animal alive that would destroy a world so brutally. you are the foulest poison this cosmos has ever seen.
food like ramen and hotpot tend to have a lot of oil and salt, so i don't get to eat them very often.
one of you seems to understand the significance of the treasure already. if the rest of you wish to follow suit, you may remain here in the meantime and explore your surroundings.
come on, now, just take it. no need to make such a fuss.
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us
i have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant makoto was. she predicted all the ways in which inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
wait. sorry, ma'am, but i think it could be quite a while before the style you recommended comes back into fashion
as tribbie mentioned, the both of you spared no effort in protecting the holy city. i would like to present you with a gift in recognition of that.
we must rescue the messengers, get out of here, and spread the news. we mustn't give up as long as there's a glimmer of hope!
i just remember being taken care of by you when i was young. once the archon war came to an end, i stayed behind in liyue harbor to honor my contract.
if my understanding is correct honorary knight, i suggest that you place the crystals in the sea.
could it be the sword vessel in lipos' ballad? the one that chartonus crafted himself
when bronya becomes the supreme guardian, do you reckon she'll let me perform at golden theater? i'll re-arrange that "supreme guardian" stage show and make it a rock 'n' roll musical!
allow me to introduce my assistants to you. they help me take care of business at the workshop.
ever since i was a little kid, i've always wanted to be an epic hero i never get tired of hearing about the quintet -- i'm sure you'll love it.
in which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. the god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
i don't want to disturb him. this installation was accidentally damaged by two of the vagrants. if mister svarog finds out, they'll get in big trouble
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation
but before leaving, i'm sure you all have plenty to say to the nameless of the past?
unfortunately, the workings of the prophecy still remain a mystery to us all.
timmy, open the gate please. i want to see mister svarog.
and what would a festival be without me? i'll be sure to go have a look, too.
whoever is secretly helping zhiyi must be seeking to benefit from his actions after his appointment. so we should be able to find some hints in zhiyi's manifesto on who we're dealing with.
hold on now. would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
what about you? are you feeling alright?
in the end, we decided to combine liyue's traditional art of kite-making with fontaine's "mechanical vertical lifting device."
what kind of place could this be? defeating khaenri'ah's monsters is no small feat, that's for sure.
why else did you think i was investing so much time and effort into this case?
haha i have my reasons.
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
i'm sorry, my lady, but no can do. there are still a few things i need to take care of back at the brigade. besides, the desert hasn't exactly been the most peaceful place lately.
get up in a crowded market like this, the only person who should be trying to hide is me.
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times it's making me a little nervous.
himeko and mister yang still have to participate in social networking. being an adult sure is hard.
i'm sorry for interrupting your conversation with them earlier. but even if you'd been able to hear them out, there's no guarantee you would have gained anything substantial.
i've seen too many people lose their senses on account of things like this. if you want to calm them down, you need to convince them with something tangible.
unfortunately, ganyu is on leave at the moment, so i'm unable to get in touch with her.
never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
you don't need to worry about little gui. she won't be able to sit still, even in a sick ward. i'm sure she'll come find you again in no time.
the battle is now upon us. let the devorator once again tremble under the blade of the marechaussee hunters.
i'll be rooting for you in the stands! don't go losing on me now!
yeah, but this time the situation's different.
it's okay, don't worry. we'll help you find her.
does this not clear all doubt?
and that photo wall filled with the express crew's happy memories -- it's obvious that miss march loves keeping records of her life.
besides, i genuinely like the job of an intelligence officer -- for me, using my brain is a lot more fun than traveling.
you should bring dan heng along next time, we can chat over some tea.
hearing how things ended almost feels like reading the end of a light novel. now we can all rest at ease.
it's yanqing's sword -- i saw him wield it one time when i was doing drills with the cloud knights.
bronya, do you really
and i've actually already restored part of the information. but lynx said that you have to be the first one to look at it, because the owner of this jade abacus is your idol.
hah, you call yourself a member of the infamous deshret's relics, and you still can't even tell who's made it all the way to your headquarters?
was that a message from lady bronya? hm, this theft case has been dragging on for too long -- she must have decided to intervene
in truth, i know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
so, listen to everything i say. let's go!
we both still have our own paths to walk. so let's forge ahead. hopefully, if we meet again... it'll be beneath clear skies.
the moment you stepped into the memory zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. i can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
heh, that harbinger may have tried to cover his trail, but he still left some traces.
the result has invariably been that they "can't".
(mister zubayr has been meticulously managing the theater. everything checks out.)
i think the key will be to make something that easily catches the attention of people who haven't played much chess before.
the youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music
could we maybe find a peaceful resolution instead? never mind, doesn't matter
i called for the gag order and for the exuvia to be hidden to temporarily stabilize the situation, and also to prevent something similar to the incident in mondstadt.
castorice, please give our guests a merciful farewell.
it might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
huh? ah ahem! why are you looking at me like that? is something the matter? if there's nothing urgent, then i shall be retiring for now.
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
i was always looking forward to the day she'd return this guitar i thought that would be the day we could bury the hatchet.
hey! did you scumbags even consider that the homayanis might've hired a merc that outclasses you?
i think they're more popular with the older crowd -- i bet gunn would know how to use them. still, if i remember correctly, gunn only listens to audio tapes...
let us return. we ought not keep furuyama waiting too long.
everyone expected my life to change after going through something huge like that.
well, in light of your impending departure, shall we take a photo together?
...as miss topaz said, i'm here to talk about this aether spirit with you.
the more i think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
don't worry about it. you should sleep for a little longer. by the time you wake up, you won't remember any of these details.
the past and the future are so similar to each other. i'm indifferent towards them.
did you travel here alone?
perhaps you haven't met me on the battlefield, but i'm certain you've heard my name. now, i'm asking you a question, so answer me! tell me
wait, whaeur"why are you all looking at me? you're not seriously expecting me to fight, are you!?
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
come on, step forward and strike with the sword in the most natural way you can think of! it's important for us to grasp your natural movements, so we can decide where to start and what you need to learn.
stop struggling, hoolay. there's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to the shackling prison.
master was a fascinating individual, if inexperienced in the ways of raising children.
that's called a united front, got it?!
you can have it your way. take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. is that accommodating enough for you?
so. any plans for the next step?
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou
the names you recited all belonged to the bravest hunters. countless monsters fell to their blades. that's likely why the devorator visibly reacted when you said them out loud.
the sky-faring commission went toe to toe twelve times against the plagues author in the past. three times we were nearly wiped out, but each time we rose up from the ashes and rebuilt.
maybe you'll make a successful intelligence agent yourself one day. i'm excited to go up against you.
it has been brought to my attention, yes.
transparent and clinking oh! i've got it!
did i sleep for long?
alright, alright, calm down. she'll be able to look after herself.
i'm sorry. i can't let you regain your ability to feel just yet. you'd be in excruciating pain.
a few of the wounded look up at you in shock and disbelief.
the garden of recollection has eyes everywhere. if he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the memokeepers -- i've warned him about that.
iaeur"i assume you two traveled here together?
don't worry. diamond has always trusted us. i'll put in a good word for you, and you'll have your pforty-five position back in no time.
lieutenant yanqing, the winner and loser of this battle have yet to be determined. don't give me that "there's no point in fighting any longer" speech!
i was gonna wait for the master diviner to get off work so i could show you around and teach mister yang how to play celestial jade.
it's all my fault -- i've been putting too much on your plate. that's why you looked up ways to manage the pressure...
we can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. but you're more attuned to it than i am.
a slow-boiled soup of leftover chicken and pork bones drenched over some cabbage leaves. i have few culinary requirements. having a few staple dishes like this is enough.
on a more personal note, i am an avid supporter of all things new and innovative.
so your invisible opponent was the legendary bosacius, marshal vritras?
how predictable did you truly think you could outrun me?
i sent multiple letters, all met with silence. you know her, himeko, the space station is but a mere warehouse for followers and rare items. she doesn't really care about it.
it appears our otherworldly friend requires some enlightenment. how about this -- the match is starting in an hour. i'll give you some real-life tactical pointers in the ring!
mine cart pin mine cart wheelset confirm just like that?
ah, about that well, the homayanis really needed bodyguards, so they reached out to the blazing beasts.
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver i just want to get there in one piece.
sorry to disappoint. the "absolutely not module" has been enabled, so not even i get to bypass its permissions. whoopsie.
shoot, they're blocking the way forward let's get rid of them.
