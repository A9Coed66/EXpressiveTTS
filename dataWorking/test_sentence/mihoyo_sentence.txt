you keep saying that you want to use this final performance to pay tribute to your director and celebrate her life. how can you do that if you're just using it as an excuse to vent your own emotions?
yes, one in which i gained valuable information. you'll come to understand more about that in the fullness of time.
ooh... seems pretty neat, don't you think?
the shogun and i will closely review the inazuma of today to find out where things currently stand. then, we will give careful consideration to the future.
i wasn't expecting to receive vip shrine visitors during down time. hehe, so i suppose you're here just to visit me?
if you're lucky... perhaps tomorrow you can return to the overworld.
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid... i can't even imagine what it must look like.
for now, while i figure out the form that eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
i still don't wish to pretend to be someone else, but i do have a desire to express myself... so maybe the show will go on for me after all.
could there be anyone worse than me?
i guess she had hoped that you could understand and respect her choice after learning the truth.
we've gathered all the missing parts... let's hurry back, we don't want to keep big ticker waiting.
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
there are too many discarded things in the sea of stars. our predecessors' trodden paths and forgotten pasts should have left behind vivid marks across the universe.
uh... you're welcome?
hehe, it wasn't a big deal, really...
hmm, suspicious... could it really just be a coincidence? i've got a funny feeling about that lady.
got it, it's all etched into my memory.
okay, i'll do my best! it's the least i can do considering everything you've already done for me.
the skit this time is a modernist one.
haha, thanks for the vote of confidence! i just don't think i'm ready yet.
and... if i win?
that's enough! you've screamed and shouted at each other for long enough. now pipe down, both of you!
as for the potential liabilities we didn't have time to discuss earlier... one good place to start might be the fungi power-up materials.
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him... right?
the interastral peace corporation -- who else? the one whose insignia is pretty much everywhere? that ipc!
uh... not the kind of waves that drown everyone, i mean the good kind of waves...
ugh, even then, humans only have so much strength. even if they do successfully summon a spirit with the incantation, it won't stay with them for very long. i really wouldn't fret about it.
huh. so it's selling slowly? why is that?
if the shogun rather than i were to discover them... yes, perhaps she would have left the situation alone.
he doesn't have to be so melodramatic, does he?
need someone to talk to, hmm? aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
exactly! ...huh? w--wait! that's not the point!
fonta only comes in sweet flavors, so how could it have tasted salty? the color of the drink, if i recall, had also been a bit off...
huh? is this still automated?
before joining the stellaron hunters, elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. that's all he said. as for the rest, it's up to me to find out.
well, can we go now? or is there something else you want to talk about?
if that was the case, i would've already left on my own... just the idea of being watched by a sage is terrifying.
she's actually something like a puppet, but not completely.
seems the devs forgot to include a surrender option...
are you okay? can you hear me? i didn't hear a peep from your room, and it really freaked me out.
no matter what anyone says, i believe your arrival was the reward for my long vigil. thank you, trailblazer.
sorry, i needed to take a moment.
this old man's words... always catch me off guard.
ah, looks like i'm the one who got distracted.
well, marcel, do you know where you went wrong?
i made some little changes. akasha terminals are already capable of sending messages. i just tweaked it so that it can connect to any node.
you want a photo with him? sure! please give me your phone. i'll take it for you!
on the other hand, i'd be happy to answer any more questions you have about here and now.
*sigh* now you know how i feel when you copy me.
hmm, you're right. let me think for a bit here...
can't sleep? let's go for a walk then.
since you were in the akademiya, why wait until now to show up? you could very well have stopped us and helped that "fake god."
it's all my fault! i didn't train enough!
i think i'm starting to get the hang of this...
huh? what's wrong? you were all so excited a minute ago... why the sudden hesitation?
oh, that's the easy part. i already compiled a list of the lost stars' locations based on eyewitness reports from across the city. here you go, they should all be marked.
hey, don't tease! i was just being a bit sentimental.
and what about lynette? where was she?
so. any plans for the next step?
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
it's the oldest and most famous animation from penacony. it follows the adventurous life of clockie and his friends in the town of dreamville. to date, over ten thousand episodes have aired!
you mean morax? it's been a while since i last saw him. a surprising decision by liyue's archon... what a fascinating god he is.
my father's name is callas. yes, the same one they call "callas the unfaithful" in the streets.
i have a guess. if these dreams are connected, then there should be some sort of order to them.
wait, are you saying my swordplay still isn't good enough?
the name setaria means "star." when she lived in the desert, she shone like the brightest star in the night sky.
we sure showed those troublemakers who's boss! are you okay, eric?
i'll write back and ask to meet with the seelie, and see how it responds.
...did that all get a little heavy for you? i think you prefer me when i'm just teasing you, don't you? hehe...
and as for the future of sumeru... i'm preparing to regain control of the akademiya.
this is the part i'm a little puzzled about...
let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the grand narukami shrine?
over the past few weeks, i've also begun to appreciate how water can take in and hold our most intense feelings and memories, as well as how one may reflect on their past by watching the sea.
...we're the ones who're stuck here! we keep going in circles...
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
hi! do you work for the interastral peace corporation? or are you just dressing fancy today?
yeah. there was once a time when i was an actress in a masquerade, seeking only to hide the truth...
...elio would always say there's only one type of destiny: the inescapable type. he can see the future, and we... likewise are aware of our "predetermined end".
hehe, don't worry. if he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
find some way to make that person realize that they're dreaming. usually, once that happens, the person will wake up and the dream's samsara will be broken.
it's for mikhail, and for the future of penacony.
but then, when they opened the door to check, the room was completely dark and there was nobody inside.
as we discussed, i don't like causing harm to living beings, and you said you need protection. so, why not join forces with us?
in your dreams! this is genius detective march seventh's case -- i should be the one paying...
this is one problem that even the musou no hitotachi will not be able to solve.
...i could tell that although neither of us acknowledged it, we both knew that the road ahead would likely end in tragedy.
the vision hunt decree is a trap. part of a fatui plot to bring inazuma to its knees.
henceforth, you are no longer a member of spina di rosula.
today feels fighting fit.
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
nope... i'm sorry, i still can't seem to remember, even after everything you've told me. maybe i'm just under too much pressure...
uh oh, i have a bad feeling about this!
i trust that she's capable of doing that, and it's something that she should do on her own.
by true-to-life, you mean... the director's sudden disappearance?
don't worry, little layla. they're just apologizing to me for defeating souka. go buy yourself a nice drink, take a break, and catch your breath.
there are many questions in my heart as well. i will need some time to go through each one of them.
looks like the key to winning lies not in the puzzle itself, but in the motives behind miss sparkle's strange behavior... i'm afraid this chase may just go on forever.
thank you for inviting me out. this trip has been quite eye-opening for me.
it was my idea to set the balladeer free. we made a deal, and he's gonna do some investigation in irminsul for me.
yes, her words were distorted by forbidden knowledge, so that's all we could hear.
at his age, he might not appreciate the extra... excitement.
uhh... my head is spinning...
yeah, if that's all a villain did in an immersia, i'd definitely be asking for a refund.
if you haven't even figured out how to be a caterpillar, how can you be a butterfly?
no matter how conclusive the evidence is or how perfect our reasoning may be, nothing will happen as long as i'm awake.
are you worried about those two? welt is with them. they should be fine.
there is no death inside penacony's dreamscape. that's the promise of the family and the blessing of the harmony. not even a memokeeper can break this barrier.
chiori! are you alright? sorry for taking so long, i got caught up and... whoa! wh--what happened to your shop?
so, i will always associate the line with her in my heart.
hehe, everything went according to plan. people started to panic as soon as they sensed that they had no idea what was happening. ah, how amusing.
...back to copying me, huh?
so the ei of the present planted the sacred sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the inazuma of the past...
looking forward to your reply. yours, march seventh.
...i understand your concerns. but if we let this drag on for much longer, the situation may well get worse. more and more people will be frozen by the goddess's magic.
that's been out of fashion for hundreds of amber eras!
as a traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of inazuma. what is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
...dad? i was wondering where he is. is he...
let's sit down here and have some coffee and sweets. it'll help me put my thoughts together.
at that time, spina di rosula was in dire straits, and his reputation had already been shattered. he had no guarantee that going forward with the truth would allow the culprit to be brought to justice.
alright, i'll leave you to fine-tune your musical while i go and procure a stage.
yes, and i took pains to make sure that you'd acquire that information naturally.
the flavors... they're way more sophisticated than soulglad.
(hey! that's not the right thing to say...)
but you would never mistake dreams for real life, right?
well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, hehe...
lumine!
ah, right. allow me to explain.
if it were me... i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
the star began to waver. instead of staying beside such a sun, wouldn't it be better to return and light up part of the night sky?
well, the only appropriate response would be to say that i'm fine, right? i'm pale due to lack of sleep, not because of the fight...
what do you say? ready to call it a day?
i admit i'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. but... this is also a safe place.
not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. she always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
of course i've read it! i've always had a keen interest in artistic works that strike a chord with the populace.
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
no wonder aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone -- the ipc can't back him up in the dreamscape.
hmm... after doing my shopping, i'll get all dolled up in an evening gown to attend miss robin's show at penacony grand theater!
no, there's a chief justice in fontaine. generally speaking, the hydro archon, focalors, won't preside over individual trials.
some things in this world can never be brought back, and they can never be changed, which is why there is emotion in the human world.
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
the biggest difference between me and the rest of the victims is that i still have the ability to search for the truth, while that same agency has long been taken from them.
if even his trusty subordinate agreed, then who was i to refuse?
here we go again... but no big deal, we're pretty handy with this bazooka now.
it looks like my card skills were superior to you this round.
all the miners here huddled together... anyone else getting deja vu?
huh, how'd you figure that one out?
hey, look where he was lying. what is that?
ha~ now that battle was really intense! those puzzles were such a blast, too -- i think i'm hooked!
come on down already. everyone's staring at you!
ah, it all makes sense now...
(calm down, furina... think. think. what do the people want? how would they imagine a god to speak and act?)
but i worry about the worst outcome: if the dreamscape's anomaly really exists, and it isn't a natural occurrence, but instigated by someone behind the scenes...
i--i don't know, either... i don't even know where to begin...
i need some more time to prepare myself...
also, please allow me to ask, as the final question before the trial begins...
although my elemental power is slightly different than that of elemental life-forms, i gained a better understanding of it when i turned into a fungus.
that's not right... that line doesn't sound very "surprised".
i heard that ball peonies represent "love that knows no end..." it does fit their marriage.
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
we did hand over some of melus' old responsibilities to florent, though. it's been really nice to have him around to help out.
i should not have left it this late to make this promise. but from this moment forth, know that i shall be true to my word.
...she left, just like that?
half an amber era ago, the family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that... everyone on the planet became part of the family.
wow, that's soooo deep... come on, stop fooling around!
but you, little one. just a quick fight and this will all be over.
o--okay... thank you.
she is your sister, after all.
i don't think this "one percent" can be seen as an example of what you call empathy.
but you and the gang put on the best show i've seen so far, twirly-whirly! that was a real blast, i loved it!
even with the gnosis' protection, we must always keep a clear mind. otherwise, we could go mad at any moment.
and your masters, the kujou clan of the tenryou commission -- they are the ones keeping the truth from reaching the shogun.
...that even after being seriously injured, to the point where he could be deemed as having lost the duel, he refused to surrender, determined to die in the arena.
it's okay, i know what you're thinking. and you're right -- we lost melus and silver, but we were able to save more than we anticipated.
she told me that you salvaged the forgotten hall's memories with great skill, that you are a rare talent.
our financial situation right now isn't the best, so all we've been doing is signing agreements for the damages to be repaid at a later date.
hehe, don't worry. i don't often use my powers like this... it's rather impolite.
hang on... i think it's trying to tell us something.
i'm referring to what was used to fight against the abyss. it once repaired the rifts of teyvat long ago.
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment...)
look, it's common sense and easy, right?
my question is, why didn't you immediately tell me about such an interesting place?
i never would've guessed that gepard and you were brother and sister.
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
the embodiment of the harmony? so, the true purpose of the charmony festival... is to usurp it?
by the way, where's yunli?
you've made notable progress. i accept my defeat.
what a heavy gate... okay, watch this!
hmm, lemme think about what would be interesting for you... ah, i know!
a carefree stroll... i like the sound of that.
...*sigh* i guess i wasn't quite ready for this after all.
the story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. and the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. approved!
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
firstly, this dream we're in is completely based on reality. people have already experienced this sabzeruz festival, so it would be very difficult for them to find anything that strikes them as surreal.
oh, um, please wait! ah, there it goes...
splendid! more interesting trinkets for me.
wait, you managed to choose the right door on your first try?
let's go. once this stage play concludes... it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
hehe, she hasn't given me any concrete reasons. all she says is that she really looks up to me.
you're stronger than you look... seem to be quite the fighter.
hmm... i have high hopes for you, child. don't disappoint me.
be careful though. don't get fooled by her again.
oh shoot, we lost...
diting can convey a lot of information with only a few sounds.
i'm really not accustomed to using a vision. why don't you teach me? ah, i nearly forgot... you've never used a vision either.
i'm fine... just a little light-headed is all...
oh, c'mon, don't worry about it! this train has been blessed by the goddess of prophecy. its whole purpose is to protect the metropole's skies.
trying to act cool now, are we? haha, well i guess it's not an act for you, is it?
hmm? we're... of the same nature? why?
even though i'm the archon and in control of myself again, i'm not very good at fighting...
let's stop here... i don't think i can walk any further...
oh, it's you! what brings you all here?
ah, it has been some time since i've attended a festival... fortunately, i brought sake with me.
haha, that's the trailblazing life for ya.
*sigh* forget it. i think our taste in nicknames is different.
more importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
arrogant as that is, it has piqued my interest.
see that? that's what you summoned. and look, now that shingo's no use, it's coming straight for you.
it was simply a new experience for me. one that is worth reliving.
now, let's work together, and make this show the best it can be!
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side... maybe even the same person.
hehe, if it isn't the leader of watatsumi island, who looks as soft as a jellyfish, but whose words sting like one, too.
there were a lot of people waiting to borrow the celestial globe, and i wasn't able to extend my time slot. so i returned it and haven't been able to borrow it again since.
"a nation to last for all eternity" is a dream that she and i both share. but i don't think that's the same thing as complete stasis.
fyreflies are such magical creatures, aren't they? they may throw themselves at a flame or suddenly grow old, but every night before that, they will shine brighter than the stars.
what's going on? why is he chatting with these bugs?
my impression is that each day in this samsara only ends at the sound of that beep from the akasha.
i can't be certain. it may be a masked fool's trap. from the execution itself, the riddlers or inquisition spirits could have done this themselves.
wasn't that place built specifically for holding trials? what's so newsworthy about this one?
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
no, no, no, this is a completely different situation! hmph, pearls before swine...
ah, it's the antimatter legion! so these crazy jerks made it all the way here... watch this!
what you said just now was pretty amazing, actually. i'll remember your words.
to me, everything we perceive in this world, everything we learn, and everything that happens to us is considered knowledge.
ah, speaking of which... actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for... that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
whether it's a one-off or not, it's a boundary that i've committed to no longer cross.
i don't want to get in the way of the original purpose of "a moment of dreams," which is to let people gather here and freely share their marvelous dreams.
i can understand the kind of pain that comes with losing a father so needlessly.
when we gave him the flower, he failed to hide his smile. you can't imagine how hard it was to get him to smile.
irminsul access granted. initiating connection procedure...
gorou has a beautiful tail, don't you think? doesn't it make you want to stroke it?
but... how will i do this? a human assuming the role of a god without being exposed...
good. go now, and keep in touch.
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
glowswather... you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
all right. i don't have a problem with that.
well, let's put it this way... any decision you make during a roleplaying game can impact the future course of the story.
you really could use some pointers on understanding human emotions, monsieur neuvillette...
witness our decision?
to have something she's been trying desperately to avoid show up out of nowhere and berate her... that must have shaken her to the core.
we'll mostly be filming typical people and scenery from the streets today to improve the sense of environmental ambiance in some parts of the film.
tell me about it... dealing with a masked fool is exhausting...
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
yeah... you could be right about that. is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
so she asked someone to look after the shop for her... but where are they? looks like they must have left too.
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
*sigh* even mister yang looks surprised -- that's not something you see every day.
guess i'll head back as well. i need to save my energy if i want to continue enjoying the story tomorrow.
hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and ei! are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
i mean, when yunli swung that massive sword, she just casually blocked her attack with ease...
as promised, i've delivered the child to you. our transaction is complete.
i won't... i won't ignore my own voice anymore.
they've given it their all just to survive.
if i'm not wrong... it has to do with the watchmaker.
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
could it be the express? it looks like it'll get to the platform before us.
however, powerless against the power in the sky and then the forbidden knowledge many millennia later, it's been unable to stir up any trouble.
hey, not everything can be solved with food!
...thank you, master yanqing!
we're looking for a man called "vacher." he may have been an eyewitness in the serial disappearances case. if we can find him, we may be able to unearth some key information on the case.
the signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
yes. something far more distant than the past. so far away that you cannot perceive it.
although this sabzeruz festival dream is under the akasha's control, only humans can dream. even the akasha is unable to create them.
ahem! lend me your ears, everyone... hmm. or perhaps one of you might like to start us off? how about you, friend?
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices... again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
so, the children in the clinic heard the story of you and the express, and immediately insisted on sending a gift to the hero of belobog.
it'll be a while before we get to poisson. let's keep talking.
hehe, it was a team effort~
does it... look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
oh, hello. miko told me about the test of courage event taking place here. i thought i would come and have a look.
in your opinion, do you think it's right to treat a trial like it's an opera?
my, my... you look like a small injured animal. are you still willing to talk to me? of course... i'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
look! this place is breathtaking, isn't it?
in that instant before it killed me, i saw the reflection of another dreamscape in those ghastly pupils.
huh? m--my reasoning?
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
...to the festival's invitation, to all lies, and the singular truth...
alright, alright, follow me if you want in on the celebration feast! come on, we're leaving!
congratulations, you won! come on now, let's hear your victory speech.
the people's resentment against their archon has been building as more and more of the prophecy is fulfilled. a spark was all we needed to turn smoldering anger into a flame.
i bet argenti would think these fireworks were really... beautiful.
i am me. there is only one of me, but i can exist in many different forms. it's not important what form i exist in.
(so now you have the complete picture. katsuragi took the kabukimono to live with the people of tatarasuna. later, the doctor showed up, disguised as a mechanic from fontaine... and that's when the trouble began.)
hehe... before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
yes. plus, she'll definitely want to hear how the end of the show went...
resulting in the shattering of the vase, the discarding of her clothes, and her abduction...
no one knows her greatest strength more than i do -- it's her resilience. if she's able to persevere in everything she does, then one day, she won't need my help anymore.
ugh, there'll be no need for that. i've seen them already. there's no need to go back over scenes i've witnessed in person before!
okay, everyone's given us a lot of useful information. let's go through it and try to organize everything.
hmm... i think i understand.
so, based on this reasoning, all we have to do is wait for it at the next astrological observation site.
if i'd lost the clementine line too, i wouldn't know how to live with myself.
uh, ahem, miss hu tao...
katou whatever-your-name-was, given the circumstances, why don't you start by going to find your brother and also picking up a handful of salt on your way. we'll need to use it during the exorcism.
hmm, maybe some of your neural circuitry is less intact than i thought...
...as a doctor, i don't accept that -- i'm responsible for their well-being. my attitude towards this "wonder medicine" won't change.
guys... does this place feel weird to you? it feels like... like there are loads of eyes staring at us.
basically, i was just saying that the nurturing atmosphere of the spina must have been my mother's legacy, rather than my father's.
look, i'm sorry, okay!? i'm sorry i drew a line in the sand without thinking about every possible grain on the other side!
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
your inference seems logical enough...
i tried to do some investigating in the akasha, but i couldn't find anything suspicious, and all the people of interest seem to purposely avoid wearing their akasha terminals...
if it wasn't for someone who's been helping me out, my adviser probably would have kicked me out of the darshan by now.
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
and whenever i think of this, i feel something stirring within musou isshin.
i was going to contact you about that, but then you suddenly showed up of your own accord. seems like we have a telepathic connection.
"follow the hints i've left, and you will find the answer to your question."
analogies are wonderful tools. they let you use existing knowledge to understand unfamiliar things.
whew... i'm assuming we've finally reached the end of the script?
hah. it's my shrine. if i say you're qualified, then you're qualified.
...wow, it's like we've got a menu, or something... sure, sure.
this atmosphere really feels strange... are you sure topaz is here?
this is a far cry from folktales that claim meteor showers "come at certain times" and "bless all who witness them."
i was only able to ensure that we made it here safely. it's possible we arrived at different locations...
you're already at this stage... just eat whatever you like.
you see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. the nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don't want to face will never come.
woo-hoo! i'll go grab the script manager from the club right away.
i remember that you liked those too, didn't you?
it would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
no... so my teddy bears and bunnies are gonna be liquefied by stomach acid? i've had them for ages... i need to find a way to save them.
such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, but as a means to an end... i need to put this aside for a more indifferent process.
please, the honor is all mine. i was profoundly moved to hear about your troupe and your wonderful director. i just wanted to do something to help.
looks like we'll have to clear out the oozing filth in this area. you two should be able to take care of it, right?
so loud... the voice... it's becoming more shrill...
you're welcome. and thanks to the memokeepers in penacony, too. i believe your partners... have also awakened from their dreams.
uh, about this question... i, umm...
...so the truth is clear now, right?
i didn't mean there's anything wrong with this place. that's not what i'm trying to say at all!
yes, absolutely! the great hero within me is definitely up to the task!
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products...
wonderful! let's keep going, then.
...this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
not to be rude or anything... we've been watching their drama. i'm dying to find out who beats who.
huh? ah... ahem! why are you looking at me like that? is something the matter? if there's nothing urgent, then i shall be retiring for now.
really? great! phew, it's less scary if someone you know is leading the way!
i'm sure this is what captivated director aurelie as well.
wow, they smell so good! they look so crispy and crunchy! i think i'm in love!
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
..was that space actually the real world? but wouldn't a real space just randomly disappearing like that be catastrophic?
ha, straight to the point. i like it!
if the difficulties are purely financial, then there must be a solution. you could put the shows on pause while you look for a sponsor, for instance.
...huh? wait! are you serious, general?
they've already left, leaving this kindhearted girl to wake you up. you owe her big time.
but i will not change how i feel about our future. i still believe that this is a great opportunity to start anew.
like you said, it's difficult to make peace with yourself.
in this realm of consciousness, her existence is tenacious indeed.
you scared me! wh--where... are you now?
...we're pretty lucky, huh? without findie, it probably would've taken half the day to find these parts.
what do you mean, "strange"? it took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
hahaha, just as expected of my partner!
and... you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "death."
the address that the mask gave you is right here. but you never would have thought... that when miss sparkle mentioned a game, she was talking about wanton slaughter on the streets of penacony.
but even so, they are due a resolution... i owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
he wanted to go investigating on his own, so i let him~
the real hydro archon? well, now you're really losing me.
you look much maturer now, yanqing.
what a fantastic night. i'm still immersed in all the happiness and joy, like a candle floating on water.
the sparkle murder case? wasn't the victim shamari from the ipc?
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway... they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
i invited you out for some simple fun and games... *sigh* i should have known you'd be like this.
was this your idea or hers?
hmm. narrative devices are truly mysterious things.
hah! if by that you mean "thank you, miko," then you're welcome. haniyyah needed a little pep talk to perk her up so that she would join us in taking a stand against elchingen. how else was i supposed to motivate her?
no, it's not that. we shouldn't involve innocent students in this. a single mistake could completely ruin their lives.
would you mind going around and fetching them for me? i have a few other things to take care of.
ah... i was wondering if we might run into her...
whew, i'm sorry to have kept you all waiting like that. i'm feeling much better now.
let me be a little firefly taking a rest on that leaf. when night falls, all the stars in the sky will adorn your dreams.
but in this dream, you showed them only the most comfortable and soothing things. this entire world has been built on a foundation of buried and unseen pain.
this guy is really into these puppets.
i know that you hate both gods and humans, but you've grown too weak now. can't you let go of your hatred, even for only a moment?
looks like we'll have to explain everything from the top. that case... a lot of things have happened in poisson since then.
(i'm beat... but i haven't felt this happy in a long time. i'll try and power through a little longer...)
the last couple of trailblazing expeditions have been downright terrifying... it's about time we had some fun, cozy, and cute adventures for a change!
if you know about corrosion and the fragmentum, then you must have heard of stellarons, right?
i mean, i guess you could be trying to pursue your definition of the avant-garde... if that's what you're doing, i suppose you do have to find yourselves a capable director...
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
that's what i meant by shared emotions.
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again... and such a tragedy must never recur.
it's not much further. follow me, we're close now.
so much energy... seriously, what's her secret?
w--w--wait a moment! you're... mirror-me? how can this be?
c--could it fail?
from the day i set foot on the battlefield, i knew that my blazing wings would eventually be extinguished. all i can hope is, before i return to the earth, i'll be able to see... the brightest light in the sky.
...but what about the "furnace" his master mentioned?
yeah, he was outside... it was uncovered and the rain could fall there. why? do you think the rain could have affected the crime scene?
the guide miss topaz mentioned could have important information for us.
i had heard that the kujou clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the tenryou commission. the search for a successor to the role of tenryou commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency...
all the bizarre spaces i saw outside the city had one thing in common: a lack of human presence.
ah, so basically, we've been meaning to commission a statue of my parents in commemoration of everything they've done for the spina and the town of poisson.
what's that supposed to mean?! you'd better believe it!
don't worry, we'll find him! just try to remain optimistic and wait for good news!
let's walk while we eat. it's time to head to the next stop!
alright, you two must have a lot of other questions for me, right? after all, you saved my faithful believer. as your reward, i'll answer any and all questions.
no wonder i haven't seen apep for so long. but how did it get contaminated...? was it due to the destruction of king deshret's civilization?
hmm... using the ipc's cutting-edge aether copying technology, we can record any creature you've seen inside of an aether coin...
go on. open it up, show me what's inside.
hey mister, are you manning the counter for the young shopkeeper of spare time book shop?
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times... it's making me a little nervous.
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
...and then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. you won't be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.
you think so? i thought i was rather accommodating. if it had been the shogun... she would have decapitated kujou kamaji without a second thought.
oh, what a pity. i was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
haha, sorry. i got a little carried away there... call me navia. i'm a partner of theirs, and will be helping investigate this whole situation.
and, you probably noticed it when you woke up as well -- the ticking of clocks all around us... my gut tells me that the secret hidden here is also linked to that mysterious watchmaker.
ah! don't expose my net handle to everyone!
don't you remember what mister giovanni said? this player beat the last reigning champion -- it can't be her...
for too long have we dwelt in the abyss.
to put it simply, it's as if the oratrice has its own will, and is a judge in its own right.
huh? that's not because of hunger...
pfft, as if you'd enjoy designing something as boring and formulaic as a uniform. that's why i didn't ask you in the first place, silly.
let's leave it there, shall we? work hard, now, hehe...
please, did you ever think i had any respect for this place's pointless theatrics?
so, i will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
"you have inflicted your twisted lust for power upon that innocent shop owner and insulted the extraordinary art of xianzhou swordplay."
all i can do right now is hope that it helps me...
*sigh* it's tragic... such wholehearted devotion, rendered meaningless by circumstance. have you been kept in the dark? or are you the only one left in the light?
hehe... she is a member of the shuumatsuban, a genuine, bona-fide ninja.
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
doesn't feel like it's been that long since we last saw you, but yanqing, are you...?
morning! any plans for the day yet? if not, why don't you hang out with me?
oh, you're another contestant... hat guy, was it?
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister... no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
although having said that, i have heard rumors claiming that i sleepwalk a lot. hmm...
it is, isn't it? who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
all this talk about food is making me hungry.
you poor thing! i'll go check the lunar calendar -- today might be unlucky.
you're right, we still don't know what happened, but my intuition tells me that we're on the right track to figuring it all out. i'm finally headed towards the truth...
hah, did you think i would agree just like that? after our performance of "the little oceanid", i've begun to make a name for myself again, you know.
dear mighty god of wisdom, i've been studying late into the night for days on end, please let me pass this exam! please, please... zzz...
huh, but it's also where a new journey begins: the adventures of mini durin and friends!
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
didn't charlotte publish an article on the liyue tea industry recently? maybe he was inspired to come buy some tea after reading that article. you know, just like you were!
do i really look like that sort of person...?
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool...
it's simple: this contains his consciousness. it's long been trapped inside of a dream.
you remember rivet town? when the fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. we didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
and what was that fire that came out of her? and her body -- where did it go?
prepare for battle. looks like we'll have to fight again.
the blade that i inherited from makoto seems to be trying to guide me... to encourage me.
me? no, no. the truth is the true guardian of scholars -- i've always believed that. anyway, let's meet again tomorrow evening at the adventurers' guild.
you need not worry about the future, and you aren't alone.
hehe... thanks for sticking with me through everything.
did you know what was about to happen in khaenri'ah?
hahaha, alright, go to bed! i had a great time today.
anyway, let's see if we can find any leads.
i sure hope they're not arguing again... quick, let's head over!
i will personally experience my own fate, with you by my side. hehe, isn't this such a wonderfully exciting thing?
...that should do. hope it can withstand the snow.
and even now, i will continue to believe in that love. so let me show you just how much i love the spina di rosula!
i hate to admit it, but i'm even starting to miss sampo... hold up! i must be losing my mind. nope -- i'll take the xianzhou over that blue-haired bore any day...
everyone, get ready. this could be a tough battle.
get it together, layla... you've gotta work harder.
excellent, that was beyond mesmerizing! even i didn't expect this scene to go so well. and we got it in a single take!
...that memory zone meme, it is here as well.
but, this door is blocking our way in... huh, it almost looks like it's been here for quite some time. i've got to hand it to the tabletop troupe. they really went all-out with the props...
so it should probably help me as well, right?
i saw her waver the moment you mentioned love.
listen, callas is long dead. no matter what happened in the past, i want to be able to start things anew.
where's this anger coming from?
please escort the remaining guests back to the fleuve cendre. i appreciate your help!
hehe, just call me "boss" from now on. that's what everyone in the spina calls me, and it's what i'm used to.
good... i'm so glad you're all okay.
the nameless -- those who trailblaze, doing good deeds but never seeking recognition. after all this time, how would we even find those three people in such a vast place like penacony?
by the way, you can have a look at this. it's a list of victims from the incident that took place here.
what vache left behind is nothing more than reagents and experimental by-products... the word "medicine" doesn't apply here.
considering even their visions have been taken from them and embedded in the statue, they are ultimately quite helpless.
hmm? what is this stall selling?
she's always bragging to me about it, but it's difficult for me to really imagine without seeing the place for myself. can you take me there?
hey! that's not what we agreed on!
and even the ones who don't believe it still go out of their way to avoid that place.
it was there and then that i resolved to pursue eternity. as a testament to that decision, i saved her realm of consciousness just before it collapsed completely, and brought it back to inazuma.
i only found out later that first snow represents "beautiful memories." my parents gave me a beautiful childhood, and i still haven't had the chance to thank them for that...
based on what i have seen today, i am forced to accept that inazuma is a completely different place from the one i remember.
it's pouring out here! wait, the water levels aren't rising, are they?
in the original version of events, katsuragi was ultimately killed by nagamasa.
clorinde isn't much of a shopaholic.
and for good reason, no? a bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
yeah, mine nearly scared the daylights out of me when it started glowing! i took a good look at it after we got out, but i don't think it ever lit up again.
the pose is exactly the same and so is the scenery in the background... i can't imagine how it's achieved.
can't believe that worked. tampering with the dreamscape's gravity is clearly strictly forbidden...
you keep saying that -- what did dan heng even say...
what...? hey, you can't just make up "titles" like that!
you may have heard that the stars are related to people's fates.
eeeeh!? you mean you won't come? no... no no no, that won't do! i can't go to the meeting alone, you have to accompany me, i must take you with me...
mhm-mmm, if it's on my tea table, it must be of the highest quality. ah, yes, and we must thank the knave for bringing these over as well.
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky... but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
(it once infiltrated the house of daena while it was closed.)
perhaps they're about to find the last disruptor. ...also, speaking of kaveh, he's an interesting one.
i'm fine, don't worry. let's investigate the three suspects next.
i get your point, but this isn't the time for deflections -- quickly, say something nice about me!
*sigh* ...i can understand your thinking. it's just that the underground is in difficult straits...
i'm pretty sure you didn't learn that one from me...
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
"a doctor does not get to choose his or her patient, my children. remember, never say no to those who come to you for help. never."
that's not for us to worry about, my friend! just learn the skills that interest you, and the gm will take care of the rest!
aaaah! ugh, honestly, what is he doing! he should have run that by me first...
ahhhh! wh--what is that!?
oh, well, yes.
...they'll remember him as a murderer... as someone whose evil experiments brought great harm to the innocent. vache doesn't deserve to be remembered as a "doctor." i know that very well.
this qian ketong person should be sparkle's targeted victim this time around.
huh. seems like if we want them to talk, we're gonna need to teach them a lesson first.
it was a long day today. all i need is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
why...? what's wrong with the family?
as you've all seen, the situation down here is... strained. if you can, we really would appreciate you helping the people.
i know there are definitely good reasons for your behavior. i'm only asking out of curiosity.
people do sometimes act irrationally for the sake of pursuing their interests.
unfortunately, you've committed one of the six cardinal sins of the akademiya by "attempting the forbidden and fearing none."
those were the happiest days...
he began to simulate mild fragmentum corrosion, thinking that it could lead to breakthroughs in developing blizzard immunity.
your eagerness to survive means that you haven't given up on that world yet!
and that is the archives kept by chief justice neuvillette. a place where detailed files on all the cases in recent years are kept.
this notice... seems like a hint for us from miss sparkle.
l--love poem? quick, put it back!
looks like you guys have the situation under control. thank you.
come on now, don't be silly. magic is all about misdirection, isn't it? it often conceals the truth while presenting a fascinating illusion.
so what happened back there? why did the supreme guardian send people to arrest us?
only the best! and i've learned a lot, too!
...i can't help but think that whether it's mister mikhail, mister tiernan, or madam razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories...
though your blade has been cleansed of her blood and filth, never shall it shine as brightly as it once did.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me...
in the headlines tonight, president of spina di rosula in "awesome" mood after spending another fantastic day with her favorite partner!
nope, won't fit... better try another.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure...
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible... but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest... yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would...
i'm not sure what may have led it to become involved, but rescuing it is definitely our top priority right now.
that's quick thinking, and very sound logic. aventurine is no fool. and working with him definitely has its dangers.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all...
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance... i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
i'm good. let's do this.
a--are you backing out now!? we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
see! i told you that something good was going to happen during our travels today! i have to say, sometimes the steambird's astrology column is spot on.
y'know, i didn't think things were gonna go that smoothly.
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
well, not exactly...
ah, it's you two. it's been a while.
hello, all of you who have just woken up.
i will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, i need you to do two things:
nothing's wrong, okay? come on. we're going to war.
hey, is it just me or is the snowfall getting heavier?
you're right. no matter how much of a hard time i'm having in academics, i should still find the time to look after myself and fulfill my needs.
mmm... that's impossible, but they are probably a scholar of the akademiya who had a close connection with the akasha.
oh? and how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
if we can get rid of it, your world will be safer too!
now who should i send... hmm... miyuki, perhaps?
like the last time we met, we're still investigating this dream, and we've already learned some things about it.
this is the residual memory from when the 'invitation' was first delivered... they were abruptly interrupted. then, what happened next is...
why... why did i see another me?
(of all the unwitting participants in the doctor's experiment, the balladeer became the main test subject.)
hearing you speak, it sounds as if your voice has made somewhat of a recovery.
currently, the shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. so the easiest solution was to announce that i am resting.
within the confines of our limited knowledge, some may blindly believe in the beauty of this world, and others may focus only on its evils.
does it? but this memory shows that niwa didn't betray you. he never meant for you to be the one to take the device into the furnace.
exactly. now, i heard there's great coffee here, and so i asked them if they'd like to come and have some.
it's like i just had an endlessly long dream... i can't even tell if i just woke up or was only now born into this world.
a simple time loop can't explain some of the phenomena. you two are still missing a lot of information. unfortunately, i can't give you any more hints...
it's like stepping on planks floating on water.
finally, the child offered some fried tofu to thank me for accompanying her, then left with her little fox friend.
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
didn't i just say you don't need to apologize...
well done. and what about you, onodera?
medicine... blizzard immunity...
why are you two arguing again? i thought things had been improving between you lately...
okay, alright. got it.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
absolutely! i wield my sword to become a hero! i want to fight for justice, punish the wicked, and make them quiver in fear and run away when they see me!
huh? that used to be a thing!?
every time i'm done sorting my album and look out the window, i always want to take another picture... even though i've seen the view a thousand times, i still feel happy looking at the stars like this.
yeah! we demand to speak with topaz!
*sigh* as long as it's there, we can't get any closer.
seems like it, but "jade abacus" does sound a lot better.
hehe, you two make an adorable duo.
i can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
i guess aurelie must have written all of this down in the hope that her records would one day be of use to investigators.
the... the emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
hey, whose side are you on!? i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
*gasp* my hat! no, my skirt! aah, don't make me choose!
um, serval... won't more silvermane guards be waiting for us on the other side of the gear bridge?
it's undeniable, being without a physical body has its perks, but when moving through the world in the form of a memetic entity, the danger of forsaking one's "self" becomes apparent.
really? that's great. you're helping with all the things that i used to do for her.
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
yes, those photos are not just ordinary records of her trips. to miss march, they are dearly precious memories.
i didn't ask for the clapper loader's commentary, paimon.
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
little misha and old mikhail's homeland... having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
so... what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word i say.
but irminsul can't change information that was well hidden in advance. i guess i must've written this story as a backup before the balladeer entered irminsul.
...anyway, moving on.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
i vow to the subjects of inazuma that i shall one day return. this is my oath. please be my witness.
and of course, grilled fish is delicious, too. oh, fish skin releases oils while cooking, which drip into the fire and cause it to burn even brighter.
maybe next time. i've got something else to do now.
it's time to get the next mastery mark!
the person who tingyun trusts the most is madam yukong, right?
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon... no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence...
wh--why did you stop talking? what kind of creepy--
oh? why are you two smiling so happily? i thought you'd be so moved that you'd start crying... hmm... i need to spend more time observing human emotions.
however, her unpredictable and variable sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so i have to make every second count.
that's so kind of you. i mean you've already thanked us so many times.
so, miss furina, would you dare to touch some of this seawater?
enough... that's enough...
have you two ever seen anything like this before?
i bid ye welcome, guests from afar!
that's fine. since it's something that took place in inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
oh, it's you... it looks like the conflict is over for now. thank goodness, if the numbers of wounded had kept climbing, i don't know what we'd have done. if only he'd have been here...
actually, i've already done a little bit of work on that, but for now, i want to hear your thoughts.
if it cannot be avoided, then...
he... vache didn't give up on his research into blizzard immunity... even after he left the city.
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
wow, you look so cute! quite a radical transformation!
you also heard someone's voice, right? it said "world" and "forget me"?
hmm... i can think of a dozen things just off the top of my head. take a really nice nap, walk all around this beautiful place...
...okay, the wounded are being tended to, and we've finished a preliminary headcount. more support has just arrived, so i suppose i finally have a moment to focus on my own matters.
she actually discovered the key data she needs for her thesis a long time ago. she just didn't organize it well enough. i'll complete her thesis for her, just as i have in the past.
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
oh, we haven't seen serval since we got back! let's head to the workshop.
ahem... anyway, why don't you two give it a try? shout anything you want. it's a real stress reliever!
it's all thanks to her that inazuma lived to see this day.
...allow me. relax, you'll be fine.
is this what it means... to reminisce?
but, if i just show up all of a sudden... people will become all quiet and stiff, won't they?
actually... i hope i don't have to fight you guys in the later stages, either...
well, i'm off to my room then. express lights off!
you shouldn't indulge her, outsider. uh-uh, i know it's difficult to tell hook "no," but sometimes it just has to be done.
the statue... is that...
i'll be here washing the ingredients. can you please fetch some firewood for us?
oh no... i screwed it up.
but i tell myself that i need to keep looking towards the future. everyone, even my parents, have all already overcome so many obstacles.
whoa! so that's a xianzhou ship? it looks even bigger than jarilo-vi!
i've said before that the metropole belongs to the people, and they should have the right to decide its future.
alright, that's all the questions i have. your turn, please ask away.
that's right... though i didn't intend for it to turn out this way, really. i just wanted to help out a few other classmates who were having a hard time while i was helping layla finish her thesis.
okay, i think i've got it now...
haha, then there's no problem at all. you know, the traveler and i already had a duel the first time we met.
apep has always seen itself as the master of sumeru and has refused to recognize the new order that was established. even now, it probably still holds great hostility toward the gods.
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
so, you're the watchmaker himself?
mister sunday, even if the members of the oak family can't fully agree on what to do about the stellaron, now's not exactly the time to be holding an extensive discourse about penacony's past and future, is it?
oh, don't listen to the shogun. desserts! cavities are no big deal -- you can just replace your teeth. anyway, i just don't see how desserts can pose a serious obstacle to my pursuit of eternity.
...i'm done. here you go.
soon after, the star witnessed the sun scorching the earth, which brought forth many disasters.
i guess that means i'm capable of completing the thesis all on my own...?
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
do you dare... to gamble such a possibility with me?
so it was all part of the plan! when dan heng stabbed you, i was scared to death...
just names and occupations? and they don't even sound like their real names either... this will be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
you must have been blaming yourself all this time. you knew kamai and the samurai became friends as a result of akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura, a game connected to your existence.
she hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
morning... can someone fetch me a cup of coffee? more milk, hold the sugar.
the information held in the ley lines is complex and disorderly. the fact that we were able to meet him to begin with was a miracle of fate...
yeah, i'm counting on you.
we were attacked on erinnyes by some unnumbered gardemeks, and there was also an attempt to get me to drink water from the primordial sea.
well, let's just say we're tagging along... it's not every day that you get to see the secrets behind magic performed on such a large scale!
they will be teaming up with us to collectively create the novel that knocks "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" off its perch. so? feeling better about my plan now?
today can be a trial run. where we go from here will depend on how well we manage to cooperate today.
don't be, it's not your fault. please let me handle this from here, even though i'm not sure i can solve it.
you believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. thus, you believe your present self is correct. don't you?
even so, it's not like i look super intimidating or anything, right?
anyway, let's just say she's got... hmm... a very unique personality.
never mind, what's done is done. it's really my own fault for getting in too deep, hehe.
seriously? and what about you? she just intentionally ignored you!? hmph!
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound...
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
so long, brother. hope you don't forget dad's teaching.
ahem, alright! then the matter's settled! now that everything's been taken care of, there's no reason for us to keep looking all gloomy and grumpy.
i've been out trying to retrieve them, but i only managed to get one of them before you showed up... oh, i didn't ask yet -- what brings you to the metropole, anyway?
i'm sorry, that portion of my memory is highly unreliable at the moment... i can't seem to remember who you are...
this isn't compassion. i won't let you escape your punishment by simply disappearing.
if i dwell too much on its exact nature, i would be putting the cart before the horse.
bring it on! let's see how i beat you this time!
performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
alright, how about this... we'll work with what we have. i'll give you some scenarios, and see if your work is up to my standards.
n--no! uh -- i've always seen you as a... m--masterful master diviner! hehe...
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
in the end, it's up to you whether you want to embrace a beautiful dream at the cost of your real life.
before he vanished, he confirmed an important detail: that khaenri'ah was where your twin first came into this world.
you're not wrong. all right, they can ask me anything. the more interesting, the better.
hello? are you asleep yet?
morning. you look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? what mischief were you up to last night, hmm?
...oh, i guess miss sparkle has written herself into the skit here, and this has nothing to do with the actual case. goldhammer -- is that her real surname?
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
the testimony of the victim's family confirms that jacques had thoughts of assassinating callas when he set out for the banquet.
ah, let me introduce you. this is mister gerunt snezhevich. he represented the knave in sending us a large amount of supplies, and is helping with our work.
we're here today to report and archive some information on a follow-up case.
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
this was shortly before the underworld was sealed off -- there were hardly any silvermane guards remaining. we spent ages trying to find a way to handle vache.
i was afraid that it would cause a disturbance, so i asked the locals around here, and they said it was fine. apparently, most hikers like to shout when they get to the top, so the locals are used to it by now.
...understood, seele. this is a difficult decision to make, and everyone feels differently about it.
phew... finally. there won't be too many hindrances after this.
in a way, i suppose i am... i have no idea what to do about my thesis.
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is...
...what's with these people!? they talk the talk then run off with their tails between their legs...
perhaps the reason you do not possess a vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you... it's a possibility.
by the way, i've just noticed... you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
say no more. if you're sick, you need to rest. i know what you're going to ask.
ahem! yae miko said nothing of the sort, and the traveler has some nerve making up spurious claims about her while she is still present.
oh, don't worry about it. i don't sleep very well, so i tend to get a little dizzy from time to time. i'm fine now.
ooh! so that's why they had an effect on that guy near the end. i really thought the summons were doing all the work.
h-hey! that's not what i meant! i'm all for some fun... i just hope there won't be any surprise party crashers like friday or saturday.
hehe, there's no need to be so surprised. while it may look like a ship, it's actually spina di rosula's headquarters.
it's too dangerous to go alone. get oleg to send someone with you.
but, how we can get him to do that... showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
vegetable oil and sawdust, i think.
well, one way would be to infiltrate a performance troupe at the opera house, only to abandon your act at the play's climax and ask to speak to her after the performance...
never forget that even when we walk beneath dark clouds along a road filled with suffering, the light of wisdom is always there, guiding us toward a better destination.
doesn't look like there are any more clues. let's head back to the crime scene.
mm-hmm, i'm afraid the conditions underground are terrible. people get sick easily here, and i'm the only doctor.
it seems that for now, this place is still relatively harmless for you.
if that's indeed what he wished for, then he should have told me that himself.
wait a sec, does that mean we've reached the grand final?
in addition, there are still some mysteries left in him. some things may be very clear from my perspective, but he has still yet to understand them himself.
leaving it up to fate? it's just how that gambler thinks.
but maybe this blizzard immunity can now bring benefit to others... even if it was made by a monster.
ugh, you two again!? we're minding our own business -- you're the ones going around stealing people's aether spirits!
we've just saved the world, right?
(it's been to the chatrakam cave, the avidya forest, and the waterfall south of sumeru city.)
once in a while, the monster would take off its fox fur at night, and lament to itself as it gazed at its reflection in the water: "i am a monstrosity, yet they are too foolish to see it... i pity them."
pay you? what is this? you want payment for a simple favor?
what's wrong? that beast tamer, is she... angry?
yup. it's just like soap bubbles that rise to the water's surface.
sure, i'll try my best.
of course, as soon as she got her award, she went straight back to her old self.
i'm sure you'll have a great time. don't forget to send my regards to the supreme guardian while you're there.
she mentioned that this transaction involves the watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
like picking all your favorite candies out from a huge pile, and building your dream house with them.
only fifteen days? alright... fine!
now that you mention it... that's what i was doing when i was transported here! i was reading a fairytale to some children in the fleuve cendre!
anyway. you're looking for a chance to shake my will... aren't you?
march... march? please reply. have you left the room?
now that i've benefited from your experience, i'll try to follow your instructions the next time i'm attempting optimizations on the shogun.
traveling between the stars... even an adult like me can't help but find it captivating, let alone the children.
so... you do have secret strength!?
hey, have you forgotten your manners?
thank you. alright, here it goes.
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
*gasp* maybe this is how the architects repel the eternal freeze!
serves them right! better luck next time, slowpokes!
whew... you scared the life out of me! we're here for the celebrations -- we're not looking for more conflicts...
ugh -- can't find a way to break their formation!
i'll do my best to tell you everything i know when we get there.
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
in that case... you might as well rest within that brief moment of hope. an opportunity like that doesn't come by often, and i thought it might help you clear your minds.
i see... but that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
she might start thinking about giving up completely, and that's the exact opposite of what i'm trying to do for her.
there are still so many places for us to explore.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
tomorrow afternoon just happens to be a shopping day for her. that'll be our chance.
...i just have a feeling.
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
it's a gift for future you. when you first told me that you were interested in joining the spina, i was overjoyed.
ah, so that means... we're not going to the luofu.
alright. listen up, everyone.
the true "sin" of the hydro archon that neuvillette mentioned...
that man, dainsleif, was the "twilight sword," one of the royal guards of the final dynasty of khaenri'ah. five hundred years ago, he failed to prevent the destruction of khaenri'ah.
are you sure that meeting here and chatting the day away like this isn't just a product of your own wishful thinking?
no. you're ill, that's all.
thanks to them, inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
why don't you go talk to miss dehya again? you might learn something new.
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
according to my patient records, there are a few that haven't come for their follow-up visits. it happens from time to time, but never as regularly as this. i'm a bit concerned...
i figured it out! the day before the resurrection, he appeared near the ambrosial arbor with a stellaron!
i can feel its anxiety and fear. it's in dire need of our help.
i... maybe i should feel glad. the medicine might not have been what he wanted it to be, but it came to something... maybe he found some inner peace...
i'm really sorry, but i have to leave for a short while... death still hovers about, and i must personally ensure miss himeko and miss march seventh's safety, and warn them...
if you have time, talk to the folks here -- every one of them will tell you about their excitement. then, when you're ready... let's "go home."
is that... hanu?
vache spent his life looking for ways to push past the limits of the human body... but he met a bitter end.
true, but the story doesn't end there. that samurai's name was yanagibashi takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the souran isshin art.
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
serval, this dunn, do you know him?
huh? but i wasn't trying to win your trust or anything. all i wanted was to clarify my point...
oof, probably shouldn't have said that... might bring bad luck.
i mean, what better way to properly think through our findings than over some tea and sweets?
...before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
he seeks an ending through "death" while i seek an opportunity for "life." though we walk on opposite paths, we will reach the same destination, and he... will not become destiny's slave.
i wonder if people will talk about me and twirly-whirly? if only i could use this experience in one of my papers somehow...
now we only need to wake up the people here, and let them return to their real lives.
(we've run into kirara multiple times throughout our trip...)
hey! are you guys causing trouble again?
consuming this would be physically detrimental. remove it from my presence.
guess not. this house looks like it's in vimara village. does the seelie want us to go there?
...he was my family, and someone i used to look up to.
the forbidden knowledge influenced you ever since you were contaminated, greatly amplifying your hatred and rage.
...and then began again.
i think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
you know what? time for some fieldwork. maybe the answers to our questions are waiting for us at the scene.
if you find any of colter's accomplices, subdue them quickly, and don't give them the chance to harm any ordinary civilians.
and if you're trying to make a new start, perhaps it's best if you don't bring up the past all the time.
huh? no, no no no, there's no need... it's so embarrassing...
well, i did, which is why...
... then perhaps there won't be any reason for me to go on the journey with you after all.
the trial of time... i hope it won't waste too much of our time.
once we know their motive, all the questions will resolve themselves.
my, my! you really know what appeals to my tastes, don't you..
since you clearly understand, perhaps you could think about making an effort, too.
(maybe this is fine. i just need to keep going, and everyone will be saved...)
...so he chose to die in silence so that he could protect me?
the moment you stepped into the memory zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. i can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
hmm... two, three, one, four... luocha emerges from the inn, goes to spare time book shop, turns into an alley, then appears at the dock with his luggage...
is that so? i'm afraid you're just overthinking things.
look... upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. phase through that corridor, and be careful -- do not alert the meme.
what i mean to say is, you flatter me, mister zhongli.
what's your perspective, traveler? you sure you don't have any memory of this?
(ugh, my head... it hurts...)
right! we haven't asked seele!
i'm sorry, i really am... but it's gone home and won't be able to return for a very long time.
and these are my companions. would you mind if they join as well?
(the strange sound wasn't from a fight, it was liliane's attempt to break out when she was frightened.)
alright, now that we've gotten all the pleasantries out of the way, let's get this show on the road.
it's not the answer that's important, but what we can learn from others' answers... right?
hehe. i don't mean to belittle them. on the contrary...
and so when he learned this piece of information, he realized that the victim had created their own locked-room mystery.
i say we go for it! if something happens, we'll just turn the whole place upside down!
surely, they would rather return to the natural cycle of life and death as soon as possible than continue to exist as they are, without a shred of dignity.
dain's brother, one of the five sinners of kaenri'ah, the one who stole the power of the abyss.
hahaha, yep! i figured you wouldn't say no to a few more.
fine. it appears that you were waiting for me to show up. i suppose there's no use in me pretending.
it's not your fault. you've already done everything you can.
it is true that i did not know why the oratrice gave out a guilty verdict that day.
what are you talking about? what mirror?
i'm glad that you're able to think of it in that way.
...hey, it feels like it got a bit warmer!
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
ah, master yunli you're already here. sorry for keeping you waiting!
they lost their lives keeping me safe during the flood.
besides, greater lord rukkhadevata must have created the akasha in the hopes that it could be used to its full potential. that's why i've never come out strongly against this.
i've never accepted that, ever. not since that day, and certainly not now.
this grand theater looks totally different... is this the power of the order?
so, if people start creating trouble for us, they're gonna regret it!
after that, i'll make some adjustments and revoke the sages' permissions. the akasha will then be like how it originally was: only operable by the archon.
they even dared to doubt their archon... i must teach them a lesson. hehe, i can just imagine their twisted and frustrated faces once they realize that i'm nowhere to be found...
take it... *sigh* go on, you have my approval!
wh--who are you? why do you look exactly like me?
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete... right?
seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker -- she takes decisive action. she'll definitely be able to help you. not to mention... you also have bronya now.
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
no way, i won't let him off the hook, because i'm despicable, remember?
can't we do the questioning here? the stellaron hunters are slippery, what if she makes a break for it?
ooh, wow! your first guess, and you got it absolutely...
the omamori from the grand narukami shrine are very potent indeed. i thought i'd put one aside for you.
good, it's decided then. i'll get started on making edits to the script.
what!? explosives? what do they want?
another wubbaboo! it's definitely holding onto another pass!
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
exactly. the prophecy that it mentioned was probably an agreement that i made with an elemental life-form that once represented its race.
...what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
however, i tend to get really nervous when my advisers look at me, and i end up completely forgetting what i planned to say...
regardless, thank you for your help today, clorinde. but if you get any ideas, tell me first. i don't much appreciate being followed.
looks like you haven't put enough thought into this, little one.
her name is sparkle, a masked fool who has infiltrated penacony... don't worry. she won't be bothering you for now. she's probably patting herself on the back for a job well done.
furthermore, i had even predicted at the time that i may wish to modify the shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. however, such changes would not be conducive to eternity.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down...
yes, i think i might ask souka to ditch her original characters and just make you the protagonists in her next novel.
(hmm... seems bribing isn't an option.)
(hmm? there's something strange about this fungus...)
so he really did have a breakthrough in the snow plains...
ultimately, he knocked cowell out, and the tool meant to cover the crime up also became a murder weapon.
look how far we've come! don't chicken out on us now.
if you miss those opportunities in life, you may never get another chance to make up for them. i suppose that's fate.
i was just strolling nearby when i noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
i have an idea! if you don't know what to do, why don't you start by helping the people around you?
grr, that sampo cheated us all. wait till i get my hands on him...
(you weren't even the one that learned "persuasion"...)
hey, that's not very polite~
i really wanna go traveling! i don't mind where we go, as long as i have my friends with me, hehe.
since you're here... can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
i'm sorry. i had no other choice...
as paimon said, melus and silver didn't choose to sacrifice themselves for any specific person, and they weren't the "price" paid for others' salvation. they... chose to become heroes themselves.
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said... if you need something from us, just say the word.
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
...i'd probably choose to ask the bloodhounds to cease their pursuit.
the answer is simple: it's because the assistant detective is the murderer.
everything was hanging on a thread at that moment... just the tiniest effort could have changed everything.
and what about all the dessert and tea? is that for us as well?
all i know are some abstract haravatat theories. in any case, my time with you has shown a lot of them to be utterly useless. i'm still trying to make sense of everything...
nice, it's sweet. the sensation is not so different from eating a dessert. a unique beverage indeed.
it's right up ahead, but... let's make sure we weren't followed first.
unyielding resolve in the face of death...
yes... as you can see, the water levels suddenly rose -- it caused quite the disturbance, in fact.
fear not. fighting is what i do best.
alright, alright, let's save the awards speech for later, and hopefully also get some rehearsals in before the real thing.
the differences are considerable and the astrological effects are entirely different... we need to consider how the effects offset and, um...
but, so what? i still think he was a nice guy, even if he was a bit weird...
as i said, i need to think about inazuma's eternity. and thinking takes time.
i'd like to... uh, i have a commission... hmm, it's kinda strange. how should i put this...
maybe that "something" is me... or maybe it isn't... i can't be sure...
is that also part of the script?
of course. let me know if another script like this comes around!
hmph, then... i can guess neuvillette and clorinde's parts.
but after my clash with human ambition, i thought long and hard. now i realize i cannot fixate on the past forever.
it's quite exhilarating to be flushed into the air by soulglad, but... why is the venue still closed when the charmony festival is about to start?
is that so... very well. then please speak, witness of teyvat, my accuser and fated opponent.
oh come on, you know that's what you want deep down inside. i can see it on your face.
hmm, well... would you consider some more... unique ways? perhaps even methods of, let's say, questionable legality?
the less fragmentum corrosion there is, the safer it gets!
hehe, i agree... it's hard not to be.
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
mister giovanni! i guess it's not that surprising...
i believe i'll have lots of happy memories here.
taking every chance to pat yourself on the back, i see.
everyone agreed on the rescue plan, but still... i was the one who initiated it.
this should fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle.
when i stand aboard the express, i can feel that you and i are really the same -- manifesting our own futures in this universe to the best of our abilities.
i don't know its name, and we have to keep our voices down in the house of daena, or else you'll get some scary glares from the mahamata.
p--please... don't move...
uh... you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you...
am i? maybe it's because i had the other shrine maidens leave. anyway, i've always been like this.
not at first. that came when a giant spike fell from the sky, turning a huge section of the rainforest into sand.
thank you both. i hope you will find somewhere nice to go and relax for a while.
oh, that reminds me. if you get the chance, you should try and talk neuvillette into loosening up a bit.
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
once you begin your journey on that same difficult yet rewarding path, you'll come to know the answers to those big, existential questions, yet they will no longer feel as life-defining as they did before.
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
but now that i've experienced this dream... i think i can say with confidence that i won't dwell too much on the meaning of that warmth.
fersman will be very happy with his gift.
get some good rest! ya know... use the bathroom and flush your anxiety dookie away~
he ran away! ah... w--what should i do now...
alright, let's also head back up, then.
hehe, it sounds like you'd be more persuaded if you saw me in my fox form?
sorry, partner, i said some weird things earlier. feel free to just ignore me.
before pursuing the eternity of her nation, she had to reach eternity for herself.
i... have been trying to do that...
i have to come up with a counter plan. and you are going to help me.
fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
sir, we came to this city to solve the very problem you seem to be referring to. the "war" you mentioned... would it happen to be against the monsters outside the city?
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
but even though sachin's research could be considered "negative" wisdom, it is still a building block of the truth. if someone wishes to follow in his footsteps in the future, i will not stop them.
you've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the sacred sakura and makoto's consciousness. but unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
hehe... the most important thing is that it's fun. in light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. wouldn't you agree?
huh? what's this... did those guys leave it behind...?
...i raised my hands just now to indicate my acceptance of the trial. no duel shall be necessary.
...it's true. i've been investigating the prophecy for hundreds of years.
sorry, i haven't a clue. i am also unfamiliar with the god you describe.
what a terrible waste... a gifted artist from humble beginnings, who achieved so much and no doubt had much more to give... and then her life was so cruelly taken.
wait. what did she just say? i didn't get dissolved! shouldn't that be enough to prove my innocence?
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
miss yae is right. also, i'm curious to see what would happen if the wisdom orb is turned off... or malfunctions. i wonder if the fungi will stay tamed, or not?
so this set... is going to be a part of the script?
when you're stressed, don't you ever just get the urge to do something for no reason?
i think i must have been -- it's not every day you sew precious gems into a teddy bear. honestly...
i have my ways, and i've been working on them for all this time... even if you look down upon me, you have no right to judge me!
incredible... this is really a sight that can only be witnessed in a dream...
of course not! who would press something like that!
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city... hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
i can't shake the feeling that we missed something today. maybe i'm just overthinking...
by "master," you mean... ms. petronilla?
*sigh* and to think i could've been working on my thesis this whole time... ahh, my stomach is churning just thinking about it...
centuries of pretending to be a different person changes you completely. i'm not the same person i once was.
we need to understand what's happening and the rate of its development as soon as possible.
eh, i was kidding, and get your own opinion!
he has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
now, we could ignore their objections and go turn the gear ourselves, but...
boss, get me a plate of fried tofu! and get some kushikatsu for these two. just the basic kind will do.
guests? i don't think they're here for tea...
i feel like i'm gonna be sick...
anyway, people seem to be behaving in a very orderly fashion. i don't see the liveliness you spoke of anywhere.
heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. there are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us... why don't we just leave it at that for now?
we've only met once. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
the deadline is looming... i'm counting on you.
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
does not a single person dare to face me?
to me, every flower carries a different meaning -- it would take me ages to decide.
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need...
i see. but when it's so obvious, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
it's aaru village, isn't it? reminds me of the first time i was out around those parts doing some fieldwork.
you can have it your way. take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. is that accommodating enough for you?
you equated people's feelings with cold jnana energy and deprived them of the pain that they have to face.
yes... initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
you mean... this was all a trick so that you'd be left alone with me? colter, are you with romeuf too?
people "wake up" to yet another dream about the sabzeruz festival, the dreams that belong to them are once again harvested by the akasha... and so it continues.
denied. use of force has been forbidden.
ah, there you are. let me introduce the team:
takatsukasa... another familiar name. they have been faithfully serving the kujou clan all these years?
...sorry, i didn't mean for that to sound so harsh. i wish i could help, really. but if i thought i had the answer to this problem, i would've said so by now.
alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the overworld and the underworld, right?
wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is wildfire.
they're probably one and the same.
that's right, i mean you, traveler. you'll support lyney, won't you? after all, he was the one who helped you the first time we met.
sure. let's find out who's better at this game.
as such, the doctor got in touch with his sister in the underworld... claiming that he wanted to support the medical effort below ground.
i mean, maybe they just really wanted us to be immersed in the feeling of being in prison? like, they'll only show us the way out once we've grown truly and utterly desperate?
what an amazing daaaay!!!
the kujou clan's honor was forged with courage, tempered with integrity, and shines beyond life and death
yikes! they scared the life out of me! why are there so many... puppets at the ticket office?
*sigh* anyone here surprised? anyone?
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
no no no! no need! standing is just fine you don't need to do that...
sorry, i need to go for now.
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
you are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity...
lauwick, your character has no more scenes, correct?
descendant of the takatsukasa clan. explain what is going on here.
judging from the structure here, the project is a huge undertaking. the sages really saw the god creation plan as their ultimate goal.
since you're the fully awake owner of this dream, it can never collapse from you waking up.
of course not, my eyesight's perfect! come on, let's take a closer look.
it was another dream about the sabzeruz festival, except it was a happy one!
everyone falls asleep here equally, regardless of our different agendas...
you should be able to identify them using elemental sight since they're elemental life-forms.
is this the moment miss yae said we were waiting for...?
huh? but i only just finished packing my bags!
i know. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
erm... so... during the duel, did you believe that callas was intending to die?
soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
haha, dan heng's not icy. he's nerdy.
the true "death"... where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
i wonder what stories have been left behind in the memory fragments that we found today?
that doesn't sound right... i need to carefully think things through...
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream... and tell mikhail our decision.
the universe is vast, and our lives are but specks. the trailblaze never ends, but against the backdrop of the cosmos, the average person's lifelong journey is merely a short stretch.
we did it! it's open! quick, let's go, i think i heard footsteps!
don't worry, i'll be fine.
the eternal land, amphoreus.
"assertive sedation techniques..." does she mean beating people up?
yeah. thank goodness you were there to help me out, or i don't know where i would've ended up.
you have wildfire's full support.
well, eating too many sweet treats might send all that sugar to your head. you wouldn't be able to think clearly about the case on a sugar rush, would you?
i'll be at uyuu restaurant -- find me there when you're done. i will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
hmm, this bronya is... really different from the bronya i remember.
don't tell me... this one is broken too!?
this is the most important part of all. quick, get ready!
do not... speak of my father.
entropy loss syndrome. have you heard of this term?
why... why can't we continue our journey together?
he's just entered the dream recently. it's definitely not him.
hehehe... you are the same as ever, kujou sara. no one can match you when it comes to loyalty to the shogun.
no wonder furina was so confident in her accusation. all the current evidence points toward lyney and lynette.
...wowwww, i actually managed to get an ipc executive's phone number without even trying.
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
of course i do. it was never my intention to place control of inazuma into anybody else's hands.
uh... what're you saying, paimon? i don't think i get it...
your arrogance may know no bounds, and convictions may mean nothing to you, but i'll still listen to what you have to say.
the boar's not a bad character, actually. he's the one who raises the little oceanid, yes?
yup. i forgot to drop by earlier when i was running errands around here.
anyway, i told her to make sure that when she writes about you guys entering the opera house with the critical evidence that you both sound really cool.
when the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the grand narukami shrine. once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
though blind, furuyama is unparalleled in his ability to appraise tea. he brews some of the very finest tea in all of inazuma.
huh, your job sounds pretty similar to the express crew's! aside from the "business," i guess...
how do i... really feel about all of this?
all in all, i owe everyone a big thank you. it would've been much harder if wildfire had operated alone.
whoa whoa whoa, why do you have to remind me? please, don't say that again! it's super embarrassing for me!
besides, if i can get the hang of this teapot trick, i'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever i go...
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
after that, it's the end...
i had no choice but to scale the walls with some simple climbing ropes and sneak in from above while the corps of thirty wasn't paying attention.
that's what i really meant when i said i'm no good at maintaining relationships.
but the problem is: on the eve of the charmony festival opening, how exactly are we going to get close to the theater? family security will be airtight, and if we brute force it... even if we succeed, it's too risky.
yeah, who knew it'd get to this point... miss yae has to face off against haniyyah...
sumeru will be free from threat as long as your health is maintained.
so i unwrapped it and found out it was a button, with a message on the back: "just press this button, and all of penacony will explode!" sounds terrifying!
after that, you saved firefly and explored penacony together. during the tour, you ran into sparkle disguised as sampo and accidentally entered a child's dream.
yes. what's common between ilman and kathya's cases is that they've both lost someone dear to them.
yeah, and a lot of it, too. a fontainian would most likely dissolve the moment they fell in.
(first, let's try to figure out the seelie's identity based on the clues we currently have.)
*sigh* that girl... i'd barely gotten two sentences out.
your trauma isn't getting to you, is it... take it easy. it'll be fine.
fortunately, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario thanks to the help of heroic individuals such as yourselves.
hi there, do you know anything about the wisdom seelie?
on some level, his reagents were able to alleviate the patients' suffering... but nothing more. they would forget their pain for a while, and neglect their regular treatment plans...
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy... it must mean we're doing something right.
i'm counting on you all, your info is crucial to us now.
since this is a trial about the serial disappearances case, the culprit's attention will be focused on erinnyes, leaving his home base wide open...
that thought has occurred to us before. we've even expanded the search area to try to account for that, but didn't find anything of value.
i wanted to show my father how much i've grown, but still, i doubt i've grown to the point that even the chief justice would feel compelled to apologize to me over and over.
hey, now that you mention it, that actually makes sense!
hey, take this! did it work?
that's the kind of person she is.
no one likes regrets, myself included.
after we fled to boulder town, i made up my mind: a tragedy like that could never be allowed to happen again. that's why i gathered oleg and the others together, and created the first sparks of wildfire.
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
people show you whatever side of themselves they want you to see. i know this for a fact.
when navia fell into the sea, her consciousness was subjected to judgement.
nevertheless, it does make sense. if someone were to successfully erase themselves from irminsul, the world would change to reflect the new reality.
i'm sending you the next treasure map, let's go find the next pass.
...very well. as you wish.
ah... but i'm actually not bored at all.
hehe, just wait until i go back, everyone's going to be so wowed by my new skills.
is everyone clear? i don't want anyone traipsing around the set like umbrellafinches.
i think it's only right to tell you.
you don't need to become a bird in the air or fish in the sea. you only need to do your best in life, and all those things you cherish will become your source of happiness.
(it was all a horrific experiment planned by the doctor... everything he did was just to plant seeds of disaster in inazuma that would bear fruit in the future.)
look, the ambrosial arbor's roots...
hey, none of that counted just now. let's start over! ready? three, two, one... go!
and that's... the end? there's nothing else in the operations log?
excellent work. you've figured it all out.
are you all right? can you hear me? do you remember your name?
sorry, that's just what happens when you live near water and don't get much sunlight. poisson's pretty much the same, though, so i've long since gotten used to it.
is that where you're headed next? fontaine, the nation of justice.
march, march... can you hear me?
this place is full of fancy little gadgets -- herta's collection. i really don't get why she'd go out of her way to collect them and then leave them here to gather dust...
but since my father was known as "callas the unfaithful" for the longest time, it would have been too controversial to commission a statue of him.
but katsuragi had sworn lifelong loyalty to nagamasa after the latter had once saved his life. at katsuragi's insistence, nagamasa killed him to put an end to the tatarasuna incident.
that dream was incredibly beautiful and enticing. ordinary people couldn't see through it, and easily lost themselves within it.
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing...
although i've been observing humans for a while, i've never been good at imitating them...
the other big issue is the people of king deshret -- all the residents of the desert, in fact. they have been mistreated for far too long.
ha, i knew she was weird...
(could there have been a third person involved? is that really a possibility?)
i--i don't know what happened there, either... h--hey, stop staring at me...
mhm, thank you so much. can you give me a hand? i really don't have much strength left.
alright, i won't tease the two of you any further.
if this person only exists in people's memories... maybe we're in someone's memory right now...
you're awesome, master yunli!
if you really have no heart, then just look me in the eyes -- i, navia, will show you the true meaning of "regret"!
it doesn't? looks like miss sparkle is more careful than i thought.
that crook wanted to cheat us out of five hundred strales.
easier said than done... do you know how?
it's settled then. my, look at the time. i have to meet with my editors, so i must be going now.
yeah... surely we've earned it?
...how about erasing all your other segments?
...which means it's you, mister sampo. i've been using this term of address -- but it was you who first came up with it.
it's true. it's ridiculous that a single probe can fetch seven hundred fifty shield.
i see... but why aren't the other people around here scared?
issuing free medicine to the needy was just vache's way of conducting experiments on his test subjects.
"a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. if we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
this doesn't count as trying to avoid my problems, does it?
i've been reminded of many people, too. kitsune saiguu, makoto, and all the other friends who i watched pass even further back.
i suppose everyone who likes to bask in the light will be drawn to that kind of warmth...
a familiar question. i think this is the seventh time you asked that.
well, that's settled then~ okay, let's play... huh?
don't worry. the shogun's not broken, i've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
mister gallagher seems to be getting at something.
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
all in black, surely they're not... ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
if we want to get our evidence, we're going to need some help. now... come with me. we must awaken the professional.
everything i have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
nice to meet you too... hehe, you're very polite.
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me... i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey...
the balladeer tried to achieve godhood with the doctor's help. he was unsuccessful, but retained the power to connect with irminsul.
that sequence of events would explain the persistent feeling that i had unfinished business.
okay. then... i'll tell you more about me.
ahem. o--no--de--ra?
greetings, friend! lovely weather we're having today, don't you think?
i'll go play with gorou, instead. it's been a while since i've seen those fuzzy ears of his.
i'll tell you how to break free of the samsara tomorrow. see you then...
personally, i think the idea of things staying the same forever is quite beautiful. *sigh* but alas, that is simply not the way the world works.
sh--share the contents of my research... and answer questions? uh oh...
alright then, down to business. as paimon mentioned previously, the tunnel seems to be something of a secret chamber...
h--hold on! we'll find someone to help...
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
even so... how did they manage to do it, and how did they choose the host?
wow! we wiped them all out in a single explosion! that's what you call efficiency!
give up? ahh... i do love the sound of that phrase. it would mean finally coming to terms with fate, but also... for me to finally be free.
there's a huge star in the sky and you're only interested in the clouds?
correct answer. now, how did you conclude that the akasha is capable of this?
(you can do it, furina! that's exactly how it's done!)
hmm... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
oh, i know where those are... my darshan has us use those two books quite often.
(how is this minor? it's an important link in my deduction!)
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken... right?
can you stop conflating the show on stage with your real-life relationships in the troupe?
haha, all merely trifling details, never mind. now, back to the situation at hand.
yes, no need to try and understand it. let me put this simply: right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
the want to escape may be innate in the weak, but whether they are weak or not... it is not up to another to decide.
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring...
according to micah, they died long ago.
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
but now that i think about it, it really was quite dangerous. thank goodness nothing bad ever happened...
wh--what is this? ...it's scary!
as the one who shook eternity, you are her potential for change.
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
i want to get as many people on my side as possible. at the end of the day, this is their city, and they should have the right to decide its future.
so you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "the miraculous adventures of the traveler."
(yes. i've also invited paimon to join.)
...what if i were to destroy the gnosis now, and awaken the heavenly principles?
as it stands, the votes are even. your opinion will make all the difference.
and if i was not the archon, then how did i manage to live for over five hundred years?
so... this fatui that they're trying to turn into a god... is called "the balladeer"?
is that the jade gate? it's huge!
my brain must be filling in the blanks... probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
that should do it... okay, let's go. mister yang is waiting for us.
i trust that nobody would object to the ending of the story being based on aurelie's true feelings?
hmmm. put it this way instead. truth, to me, is like a shroomboar.
maybe we've affected the way his subconscious constructs dreams by following him here.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
this will be hard for the people that have come to rely on the wonder medicine... but it's up to us to remove this false hope.
this tie is a piece of evidence, right?
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
of course, we should remain ready for anything and continue doing our best to rescue others. i'll be sure to have everyone at the spina di rosula ready to render assistance.
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
i heard there's a place in natlan that produces precious stones. next time there's a lull in my work, i gotta go pay it a visit.
why? it's not like i'm here to cause trouble. let's just relax.
if i find out they're preventing me from doing my job... or if they're bringing harm to my patients... i won't just sit on the sidelines.
...wow, things are getting tense!
(we've used up all the evidence we collected. there's no way for us to make a rebuttal here.)
you can go and... have a look around?
how are you doing? found them all?
i am your past, the everlasting law, the guardian of eternity.
well, would you think of that as a coincidence?
i bet it's about how to deal with the generals from the yaoqing and the zhuming.
i see... i can understand that.
that's just the psychic bond between cute girls and cute puppies!
i had to scare them a little, though. otherwise i hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
this little clinic has huge numbers of patients to deal with every day... if i didn't have you here to help me out, i wouldn't be able to focus on giving them quality care.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
i heard that first mining team found a geomarrow vein with incredible deposits... the initial estimate put it at the largest discovery in the last thirty years.
i dunno if the clues are following a timeline or if they're based on the amount of regret i have... either way, this incident was bound to come up sooner or later.
hahaha, that's quite the imagination you've got there, paimon.
pipe down, everyone. we need to move on to the next scene!
*sigh* fine, i'll leave him alone then. we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
she said she used to be terrified of papa, so as a result, she found all the rest of the spina super scary as well.
uh... i don't think we're at that stage yet. miss topaz seems like a reasonable person.
it's fine, it matters not. what's done is done...
what should we exchange for it?... and who should we give our stuff to?
our identities are like masks. when we switch between them, we change the way the world perceives us.
(korina, desyree, joinville, jolienne, essonnes... why are so many people here? and why do i have no recollection of this case?)
to put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. to put it more bluntly, there are things that even the seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
the moon is simply magnificent tonight. we mustn't squander it. come, join me for a moonlight stroll -- i won't take no for an answer.
ahem... well, i am the second-generation president. melus and the others are still used to my... previous title.
i know, i know, but...
unfortunately, given that said antagonist is under the protection of two commissions and the raiden shogun, we would be rather hard-pressed to track them down.
okay, here we go... eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
no matter what ingredients we found, we would cook them over a fire, and whoever lost one of our games would have to eat all of it.
from what i've gathered, it seems like most people in the overworld are leaning towards signing the ipc's contract.
our goal is not only to find the dragon, but to also enter the world inside of it.
you won't fit in the suitcase! can't you walk?
huh? ever-hunt plains? uh... yeah, sure! big sis will take you there.
see? it's not just me. i always want to bring something when i visit papa. perhaps we might even have a picnic. he wouldn't be angry, would he?
isn't that all the more reason for us to go? there could still be guards trapped there, waiting for someone to rescue them!
now then, let us be re-introduced!
i was just out on a shopping trip. i ran out of macaroni, so i went to grab a few more bags.
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
hmm... i don't know how to deal with people like that.
today, at long last, you and inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
people are pouring in! kinda feels like all sorts of baddies are showing up. let's get in there quickly and enter the competition!
i always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food... hmm? you'd like to see me do that? hah! i'm sure you would.
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
but i believe this is the key to saving irminsul. that's why i've kept trying to decipher it.
huh? i--is that... dan heng!? you...
mm, i don't blame you for that. a disregard for human life doesn't exactly endear you to other humans...
no... bahram still remembers him. he just forgot about the fact that this person went missing.
then let's get through here before the water level rises.
wait just a moment... could that mean...? you two, with me, quick!
before ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet...
what's with you turning into a scaredy-cat? i didn't see you worrying about lawsuits when you wrecked that giant mech.
besides, i'm sure i could master dishes like "la lettre a focalors" or "blubber profiteroles" in no time. if i felt so inclined.
anyway, that was all. look after her, now.
thanks so much! we'll be waiting -- patiently.
you took your time. i was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, miss "sole of the deep."
of course, crew members are always right.
this might take some time. in the meantime, you should also work on your own preparations.
once the balladeer realized he hadn't been betrayed after all, it must have completely changed his view of the people of tatarasuna. now he saw them as friends again.
(hmm, no, there doesn't seem to be any notable connection between these two pieces of information.)
it seems the others have also remembered something.
but wouldn't that mean getting rid of them!? ugh...
it'll give you a chance to figure out her moves in advance and come up with a counter strategy. that should be a big help, don't you think?
shouldn't this be expected of a memokeeper?
you should probably ask bronya to explain it to you.
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
i hope that by the end of this journey... everyone will have achieved the outcome that they hoped for.
no. i will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. memokeepers don't need a dreampool anyway.
that's our bronya -- quick as a flash!
am i? i feel pretty normal. anyway, this case has really got my detective blood pumping. i need to get to the bottom of it...
now to set the record straight with svarog. let's get in there!
haha, it's alright, i don't mind. besides the gift, i've also got another surprise -- guess who's here?
so, how could i possibly resist it... i mean can you imagine? i can actually free myself from this icy medical cabin in this dream...
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy... and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
from my past observations, setaria will take a day off from the akademiya every ten days to do some shopping in the city.
but... general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
that would be something of an oversimplification.
(hmm... i think it's slowly starting to come together now...)
uh... i leave penacony in utter disappointment... is that okay?
hey, why are you laughing... wait, did you write it? it's quite poetic.
hehe. when i say rebellion, i don't mean betraying the shogunate... i mean, inciting a certain someone to betray the tenryou commission.
hmm... let me think about it...
of course! everyone knows that chiori makes the most gorgeous outfits in town. all of the spina di rosula's formal wear is custom-tailored here!
hmm, assuming the seelie is intentionally linking the clues to my past, ah, i think i have an idea.
i will use my blade to confirm whether you are out of practice or not.
i do as she wishes. i can say no more than this.
thanks, clara. your thoughts mean a lot to us.
a name is a way to etch a memory onto the world. losing the line that bears her name, that i can see every day, would be like losing my mother all over again.
"breathe freely..." that's been our wish all along.
hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. this'll make excellent source material, too.
come on, asta has been worried about all of you.
when i returned to inazuma, i was shocked to find that a great sakura tree had appeared on mt. yougou. the tree that you know as the sacred sakura.
the timescale of dreamflux reef differs from reality, so we mustn't lower our guard. you're sensitive to memoria -- a slight misstep, and you could get lost in this memory zone.
yeah, i've lost count of all the dolls i've made. still, hook clearly likes this one a lot.
i'm just here to try something new. there's no fun in reading the same kind of thing over and over again. relax, it's just words on a page, isn't it? what could i misunderstand, really?
paimon, we will never understand it, and it will never understand us. that's how it's destined to be.
what do you mean? that's me too, y'know. the "me" that my patients see, at least.
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
this enemy is completely different! if i didn't know it was a product of the fragmentum, i'd think we were fighting a human!
i'm j--just a little too tired to walk right now... but i still need to find three more shroom buddies to qualify for the tournament...
it wouldn't be possible with a normal pathstrider.
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
grandpa? do you mean... you're the watchmaker's grandson?
wh--whoa! quick, look!
isn't it dangerous for them to make camp right under svarog's metal nose?
you understand what pain is perfectly well, even without a heart. you're just burying your feelings.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
anyway, stop playing tough and start talking. there won't be any room for negotiation once the maison gardiennage gets involved.
are you ready to take your sabzeruz exam and graduate from the festival?
right? yet it was because this was such a preposterous notion that the investigation could never really move forward before.
okay, we can talk here. you asked me about the plan -- in fact, i've been mulling it over for quite a long time.
that sounds like... both buttons can do the exact same thing?
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within... the stellaron.
if you want to move the audience with your music, you must fully commit and immerse yourself in your role, pouring all your emotion into your performance.
so this is all aurelie left behind... just whatever she was carrying on her person, and this tattered old notebook.
what about you, mister yang? i heard that even miss robin wasn't spared, and that guy locked you both up...
so why were you hiding from the silvermane guards?
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
my take on this might surprise you.
ah... well, that's, uh... all in the past now...
i think that's probably why she didn't step in to mediate, or oppose the building of the lines.
during the irodori festival, the area around the outlander affairs agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
oh, you're back, too! how are things?
hahaha, believe me, even if she were to end up at rock bottom, she'd find a way to somehow laugh it off as one of her silly mistakes and climb her way out.
ugh, and with papa's stubbornness, i can definitely imagine how it must have gone down...
got all your intel? come on, let's head over to that great mine, or whatever they call it.
yep, we're from the astral express~
oh please, do your worst~ i never asked souka to win in the first place. besides, maybe suffering a humiliating defeat will give her the epiphany she so desperately needs.
you have a point. there's nothing special about my background or experiences. it could be anyone's...
hmm... i guess i'm the moon.
if this rain keeps up, my fur will be dripping wet...
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point...
"life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
i'm back! here, allow me to introduce you to the script manager, mister florian!
when my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
so this puppet known as the balladeer erased himself from irminsul... hoping that he could change the past.
and i, navia, have the honor of being its renowned president...
oh, by the way... i ran into charlotte just after i left the memorial service.
i have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the tenryou commission at present. does this have anything to do with kujou kamaji?
i know you've always perceived there was something special about the sacred sakura. but to me, it has always been there.
alright, alright, there's no need to be so formal. everyone's practically old friends by now.
uh... is it that difficult? wait, does this game suck?
in which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. the god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
just as i thought, it's something to do with me again.
an important guest? who could it be...?
there's a few things i'd like to look into. you should go take a walk and try to unwind.
ah... wh--why are you looking at me? i had nothing to do with it...
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing... pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
fascinating. i'm learning a lot today. let's get this underway.
oh, i get it now. the last scene is all about singing the praises of the order.
that would suggest that zhongshan is not the murderer.
so you admit it, then? you're not in this to save lives. you're in it to get rich.
*sigh* finally, all done... i better meet up with fu xuan if i wanna keep going through my memories.
"north beyond the starfell lake, south across the windswept plains, just for berries squeezed and mint infused."
all those who sacrificed themselves back then gave their lives fighting for a future... but perhaps the future they were hoping for is not the eternity that i once strove for.
that's exactly what everyone back then told me as well. that it had existed since time immemorial. they were so matter-of-fact about it, and couldn't at all understand what i was so surprised about.
i don't know whether you can tell, but... the years of suffering and loneliness aren't the only reason i have a hard time facing up to who i used to be.
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
no matter. we'll just finish them quickly.
hmm, the plot thickens... halsey's disappearance and cowell's death are both quite inexplicable.
the original plan was for ei to simply discard it. but perhaps ei thought this to be too cruel, because in the end she chose only to seal the power within it.
a... happy pose? you mean, something like... we were laughing together at a funny joke?
in accordance with my wishes, the shogun did her best to create an eternal nation. a nation that, in theory, should remain entirely unchanged over time.
is this a teleportation device? what energy is powering it...
yikes, sweet talk alert... but it's true, thank you, mister giovanni!
huh. weren't there balloons and other decorations here? where did all that go?
all you need is to ask his opponent, clorinde.
health is everything -- you won't be much use if you neglect yours. let wildfire take care of the furnace core for now. you head back and recuperate.
in sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
my power as an archon? there are many ordinary citizens in the audience. how can i just carelessly demonstrate the formidable power of an archon...
considering you two, i think you should have no problem making it to the end.
this is where we split up... she can't be too far away!
i guess even the hardest problems can be solved as long as i'm willing to try...
mister yang's instinct was right all along -- luocha is a villain! how could he do this? tearing up a book as well-written as the angler mystery... unacceptable!
i'm really curious to find out what the first thing you'll do today is.
besides, life's always full of surprises. you gotta learn to just enjoy it!
c'mon, you still haven't figured it out?
you lured them into these dreams, and even now remain completely unaware of how evil all of this truly is.
good news, everyone -- it's done! the opera epiclese is booked.
woah, woah, woah. it's not like that, paimon!
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
hehe, we really are the best of partners. come on, let's go.
that's not very likely. the power of irminsul covers every inch of the land.
oh, come to think of it, i haven't seen twirly-whirly in a long time...
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
however, in the end he reconsidered, and instead shared everything with callas, hoping to seek the latter's protection.
...back then, it felt like i hadn't just lost a father, but a close friend as well.
we just barely managed to push it back, right? in that case... won't it come back to target the people again once it's managed to recover its strength?
you can't say that the victims of the dream really did anything wrong, and what they wanted was also not unreasonable...
(well done. smart and attentive as always.)
yeah, the sun was too strong, so i decided to take cover here for a while.
there's no end to this. let me try.
this happiness was so common as a child, but before i knew it... this feeling was buried in the bottom of my heart.
i, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. so, i will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
the rules still stand. these little ones won the tournament and passed the ultimate trial, which means they'll be taking elchingen and kautilya's place.
her clothes are here, but she's nowhere to be found...
i am focalors. the eyes of countless fontainians are upon me. i must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
of course, and thank you, melus. you've provided us with a lot of great information.
and i am she who promised a dream to her subjects... raiden ei.
that massive tree has suddenly sprung to life!
mmm, what is it then... my answer is "bugs." is that right?
to be honest, maintaining dunyarzad's fading dream took a lot of mental energy... i think i may need to rest for a while.
great idea! shame we don't have any.
ta-da! guess who's back?
strange... very strange...
you said you were gonna help me, didn't you? why are you holding out on me now?
we're deep inside the fragmentum... there could be hidden dangers lying in wait.
...far from it. i'm still a long way off from being a real archon.
no, no! we've got enough on our plate.
see? even the oratrice has decided to show me its favor. are you sure you want to commit to a charge that will never be upheld?
you're our good friends, which is why you didn't stop him from dropping out of this round, and why you don't feel disappointed in me.
looks like you'll have to make the trip yourselves. this was as much as i could do.
#(the research notes said that the melusine race perceives the world very differently from humans. {m#as a result}{f#because of that}, the melusines have also developed a sense of aesthetics that appears rather strange and alien to humans.)
you should go to sleep now. don't worry, i've made sure there's a sweet dream waiting for you.
she shuts herself off in her inner world, leaving all the affairs of the outside world to be dealt with by a puppet who has a singular focus on the pursuit of eternity...
why isn't svarog helping you?
and then there's the preparation for my thesis defense... i'll need to mentally prepare.
anyway, all that matters is that you woke up safe and sound.
(hmm, seems this won't produce a particularly effective rebuttal.)
the quicker we handle the ipc, the faster we can get back to enjoying the celebrations. let seele know when you're ready to go.
at least the choice is in my hands.
lyney did not need to take part in the dissolution of the young woman at all. indeed, he did leave the scene via the vent.
sampo's gone to clear up a mess of his own making, so i'm looking after you in the meantime. based on your current state, i don't think there's any cause for alarm -- you seem perfectly healthy.
(there's a fungus on patrol in the center there. it looks pretty vigilant, so i'd better go around it.)
seeing as we're in penacony... the answer is "sweet dreams troupe," right?
and even ei is finally starting to come to her senses. quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning...
again? i'm starting to get nervous of "arranged rest" on this planet...
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
that's the friendliest thing i've heard since we arrived!
...there it is -- it's hazy, but it's ifrit's voice. the other one... is probably his progeny.
this should be setaria's favorite fortune-telling spot.
of course, i have armed myself to do far more than smash your alibi. confidence cannot go unfounded, and my foundations are rock-solid.
uh? he didn't send you all here?
*yawn* coming, coming... seriously, who's knocking before afternoon tea...
we told pom-pom all about our adventure, and... they suddenly started crying... i've never seen pom-pom so sad before...
you're so kind. i had no idea i'd meet someone so nice in sumeru city.
well, maybe it'd be more accurate to say that i knew that she would be there, and there was no way she'd just let me go...
well, don't start celebrating too early now. even if i have been carrying a curse like you said, how does that prove that i am merely a human being?
do you know that chocolate candy that's made in the shape of a bullet? it's so sweet, it's like an instant shot of energy to your whole body. well, that's what this feels like!
looks like another completely new monster.
okay, okay, i won't push you -- everyone has their secrets. besides, given the circumstances, my curiosity can wait.
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
thunder's roar and lightning's flash. so ephemeral. this is why reaching eternity is desirable. ...actually, no -- this is why reaching eternity is necessary.
after all, a life with no obstacles tends to narrow the mind. people end up believing that only they are on the right path. sometimes, obstacles are more valuable than smooth sailing.
the ever-flame mansion has set out on a journey. those poor people... they have no idea what lies in wait ahead of them.
were there any unresolved matters or regrets between the two of you?
let's go, i think this conversation's run its course...
but the vagrants here have keen eyes -- they couldn't keep it hidden from them. some local gangs wanted to profit from the situation, so they blackmailed the mining team for hush money... and that was the final straw.
hmm, a most opportune outcome.
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
think of it as a catalyst that can reproduce the raiden shogun's combat moves. i made it from my own memory, which means it should be perfectly accurate -- unless of course, her skills have declined.
i'm sorry, i'm not feeling very well. everything is... spinning...
hey, are you on her side? i just wanted to remind her not to break her promise, that's all.
as long as everything goes smoothly, we'll get through to setaria for sure. she'll never guess that we had anything to do with it.
so what we're going to do is create inazuma's newest hit novel.
you used to represent my past, but from today onward, you are me.
mhm, i do see your point. but are you sure you wish to do this?
hehe, perhaps... or you could take the view that she's acting like a little child, throwing a temper tantrum and locking herself in her room. don't you think?
sometimes i stand at the door of the clinic and watch her running and jumping around... and my tiredness simply goes away.
...thanks. without your kind help, i wouldn't know what to do.
if you thought childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence...
i know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the dreamscape than others. this is also why i have to accompany you.
and since the spirit is susceptible to erosion, she placed her consciousness inside her sword, where she remains in a meditative state, free from all disturbances.
perhaps i should call you, "the dream's owner"?
i think i'll wait to see how this experience plays out first, especially when it comes to the quality of the script. if it's sufficiently fun, then i'll join.
hmph, you're the one getting excited... my first detective case! finally, my intelligence and wisdom have a chance to shine!
let's quietly follow her. once she starts talking to her acquaintances, we'll find a safe spot to begin possessing them.
by the way... i heard that you had a duel before the throne, with a fatui harbinger no less. courageous and astute -- i must say, i am most impressed.
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
...what? that's all!? if neuvillette were to hear of this, he could charge you with underpaying your labor!
...sorry, it's so beautiful outside... i got a little lost in thought.
to be honest, i don't have high hopes for any follow-up that the authorities might conduct...
although it's all just a boatload of nonsense, the faith of her homeland may turn out to be setaria's soft spot.
the shogun does not make mistakes -- she is incapable of doing so. but i, as ei, would like to offer my apologies.
that lacks a sense of propriety! i'm not just writing a letter. i'm writing a handwritten letter! i've gotta show them i'm really on the xianzhou!
everyone on the express is a passenger.
so strange... the family insist that the dreamscape is absolutely safe.
now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. it does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
(if i remember correctly, he's already several thousands of years old...)
heh, well your rod was missing a part too, so... i guess that makes it fair.
hehe, okay, first off... have you discovered the hidden truth?
(halsey's clothing was in the tunnel. so there must have been some fear that she would attract attention...)
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you...
but the monster soon found solace when another came to live among the foxes who was not their kin: a kitten, carved from the wood of a white tree, who had been abandoned by the humans.
everyone's really throwing themselves into their roles. i haven't seen such a fine performance in a long time.
oh! uh, i mean, you're so nice and all, and everything here just makes me feel so comfortable...
wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. like i said, you can think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground.
alright! here comes, the jarilo-vi trailblaze team!
"always watching over you. sincerely, the wisdom seelie."
still others look deeper inside, and determine that a shroomboar is... meat.
she said that she wanted to become someone like me -- someone who could lend a hand to others, instead of standing still and waiting for others to help her.
haha, what florent meant was that we asked the journalist to choose a new alias.
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
how does the saying go? "trouble comes in pairs"...
indeed. in kafka's words... that's also a "missing part" of my life.
it's not as simple as falling into the sea...
do you have a new story for me? i'll trade you some candied ajilenakh nuts -- i made them myself.
hehe, i got us covered! we will, of course, be taking... the aerial express!
apep, i know we don't see eye to eye, and that we have a very different understanding of the world and its orders.
wh--what was that... did something happen to pom-pom!?
haha, well? what did you think? were you scared?
in fact, the name "baal" and the title of raiden shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up until--
hahaha, i doubt she did it on purpose!
the annihilation gang, that band of desperadoes who all disappeared after meeting you... what exactly happened to them? well, let me reveal all.
huh? what do you mean? ...do i look excited?
by the way, there's something i need to confess...
but... this is not its most intrinsic function.
carve out a new path of fate with our own two hands, of course! i draw my weapon!
if her condition grows any worse, it's possible that i might cease to exist as well. then there wouldn't be anyone to help her.
you said i should go thank everyone as myself, right? so...
to put it bluntly, it was constant torture with no end in sight.
madam faruzan and me were hired to fine-tune the compass and other equipment. we sailed around the sea of clouds all of last night to put the system through some stress testing...
oh, i see... i'm so glad that you and your family were unharmed.
there was once a brilliant overworld doctor with unmatched pharmaceutical skill.
lynette's ears drooped as soon as she heard that we'd have to be out and about for days on end. and freminet... he hid himself under his helmet as soon as he realized there'd be people around that he didn't know.
little layla here breezed through her first battle, souka won hers by a hair's breadth... but mine was rather disappointing. my opponent was a frightful bore.
you're the only one in this world who calls me that.
judging from the look of things, i find lyney an unlikely mastermind.
even if i don't know drunken swordplay, i've got other tricks up my sleeve!
it eludes me, but there's a known semblance in the memory zone, mirroring the essence she radiates... what reason does she have to delve so deep into the dreamscape?
um... this gentleman is?
however, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
it seems kinda complicated...
no need to stand on ceremony. besides, i wouldn't have asked to come along if i didn't have a good reason.
plus, with how much your intel has helped us out in the past, to the spina, you're more of an intelligence agency than a fashion boutique.
are we missing the forest for the trees here...? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
please have some food. who knows, maybe you'll feel better after eating something delicious?
(i couldn't think of anyone else to be mister yang's boss...)
think about it. how can you conclusively prove that an archon can't also be affected by the primordial seawater?
for all i know, i could even be the seelie. but... what if i am?
let's get going, to the interastral tournament festival venue!
why... because you are blessed with a wonderful fluffy tail, that's why. i think it's very cute.
i'm not sure. everything happened so quickly. but regardless, the family must be hiding something -- something about the truth of the dreamscape...
i recognized him immediately -- he's one of the people that was getting robbed by the treasure hoarders.
wow, where did the time go...
fine, give me a piece of your mind if you want! i admit it. i was kinda out of line...
plus that's where we parked the astral express! don't you worry, we'll protect you from the monsters and clear up this mess.
but... what is the price to attain all this?
oh, yeah... ah geez, this is gonna be a tough case to crack if even my instincts are off...
you know very well what that means. even more so than i.
ahem... i'm quite alright. just feeling a little stiff.
*gasp* did you see that? i think something's moving...
but if you mean what i want to do most, right here and now, then... i guess it'd be to simply do nothing.
i had an opportunity to feast with him once, back when i was just a kagemusha attending a gathering of the gods. so he's made his choice. be that as it may, i don't believe his story is anywhere near finished yet.
but we haven't heard anything about the watchmaker having descendants, and the name "mikhail" is not rare. perhaps it's merely a coincidence.
that's right. it's possible that we're heading deeper into this dream now, and the deeper we go, the closer we'll get to the essence of the dream.
...but i'm curious, why pick aurum alley of all places? it's packed with tourists around, and it'd be bad if someone got hurt.
that must have been when we all gave mini durin our blessings, right?
thank you. right now... you don't know how much that means.
this dream was built by the akasha, and it has the power to create imaginary people who no longer exist in the real world.
as much as a little bird might love exploring the forests and mountains, tasting new and different fruits every day...
yes, i know the rule, but... but... ugh, it should still be applied on a case-by-case basis! i wasn't ready for this yet!
don't you... want to say a proper goodbye at least?
descendant of the kujou clan. regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the kujou name.
oh, don't worry. i've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
i was also hoping that this could be an opportunity for you to learn how to interact with people normally... but it looks like that didn't work out.
looks like you've remembered everything now.
you mentioned appropriate compensation. perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
with all this in mind, firefly and her companion -- there should only be one -- have entered this corridor together.
automaton... stealth bomb?
wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?
those were my thoughts when i created you.
now that i think about it, sending flowers is quite the tradition in my family. mom, dad, vache, and i... whenever something good happened, we sent each other flowers to celebrate.
mister assistant detective, please feel free to point out a suspect as the murderer.
...dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past... if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
...wait, we haven't been thrown into prison yet, have we?
all the painstaking effort that miss sparkle put into it -- how could i ever miss it?
let's go -- can't keep a girl waiting, can we?
i think the answer to that should be pretty obvious.
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou...
we'll take those invaders out soon, don't worry.
oh stop, you're making me all flustered. although... hehe, not in a bad way.
hah, try keeping me amused this time.
well, if this is someone's dream, then everything here must come from deep within their consciousness ...
*sigh* please stop bringing that up. let's just say that landings and crowds don't mix.
uh... thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
the chance to just stop and talk like this is certainly not easy to come by... wouldn't you agree?
however, i do understand that they had hoped to find greater lord rukkhadevata instead of me, a symbol of her passing.
there's something that i'm very concerned about.
true, but i have made a decision to retire from the stage.
i see. well, when you put it that way... looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
yeah, yeah, we're watching.
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes... truly are sorrowful.
indeed we did. it was the biggest difference between us.
here, this looks like lab equipment. maybe vache left it behind.
...could you pretend like you didn't hear anything? now's not the time.
according to current rtawahist research, a meteor shower is a celestial phenomenon that occurs due to the interference between many intricate fates.
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
at the intermediate stage of my journey, or chuuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. the art of the polearm -- slashes and backslashes.
come on, let's go back to the house of daena to make preparations. you'll have to tell her later when she wakes up.
as i stand here by the ship, i can't get the images of the rising water out of my mind...
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
as for this fungus... it has elemental power flowing through it. definitely not anything like your typical fungus.
...that's all i have to say. we do not discuss this matter again.
huh? a supernatural tales anthology! sounds like a good bedtime read... might stop me daring to run to the bathroom at night though...
yeah, it's been a while, and i thought i should let the express know that i'm safe and sound here.
thanks to my eloquent and impassioned speech, monsieur neuvillette was moved to provide us with a fitting stage for this special performance.
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
after that... i will abolish the sakoku decree.
but do you still remember? i said... "i have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
don't worry, i'll do something about it. let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
the stellaron issue concerns the life and death of everyone on penacony. if anyone has a better suggestion, the crew is more than willing to listen. also, it'd be best to tell us the ins and outs of that meeting--
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
cloudford victory zone -- here we come!
now we know he didn't do it on purpose... hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
no, not at all. i just figured that since we don't get to enjoy nights like these very often, we should try to enjoy it to the fullest.
we're probably getting close now. let's search this area.
i'm sure you probably want to ask what that knowledge was... please forgive me, for i can't tell you that right now, but i believe you'll discover it one day.
uh... well, what about the pay?
do you think they felt the effects of the battle just now...? let's go ask around.
but enough of that, i need to pull myself together. the memories i've been reminded of are all really taxing.
hold on now. would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
i see... thanks, i appreciate it.
exactly what it means: down.
yes, given that so many people have been experiencing these beautiful dreams, i would say it's very likely that they're interconnected.
can you two say anything without quarreling? this isn't the time! it sounds like there's danger waiting for us in the inner section, can we still get through?
besides, none of these trials were the one that i'm looking forward to the most...
there's actually more than one memokeeper who's come to penacony -- she mixed me up with someone else. but no harm, no foul...
luckily, the guards responded quickly, and stopped the dragon from taking them back to his lair. unfortunately, though, he dropped them before he flew off. now they're scattered all around the metropole.
are you still... continuing down this path? this is a rare opportunity. leaving here... will also mean leaving the truth.
huh? who's that? who's calling me? where are you?
i told him that the heavenly principles may be awakened if i destroyed a gnosis. although it was just a bluff, he still fell for it.
y--you mean... they're all...
over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
*sigh* this must be the overflow of hydro from my person! well, can't quite help being the god whose dominion is the waters, can i?
*cough* um, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the opera epiclese.
wha--! but we caught you! what's with the q&a?
that's not true. a relationship between two people is not simply a ledger that can be reset to zero.
wait, what did you say!?
haha, thank you for your advice. these are the kinds of things you only really figure out once you've tried them out yourself.
hello, sir! is there anything i can do to help you?
i'm the garden of recollection's memokeeper.
it's so dangerous, don't you worry about him?
can't hide it anyways, penacony is plastered with our posters... and because the astral express is so well-known, the family won't dare to make any rash moves.
since your mind is made up, i will return to you that which is yours.
he wandered off, but he left behind the puzzle piece.
actually, we've already met the watchmaker...
if the seelie is trying to make me remember things that happened in the past, it would make the most sense for it to hide clues in memorable locations.
ha, even dan heng the sensible has his adventurous days!
i won't press charges for your attack. that should also help demonstrate my sincerity.
mister yang! is this really the best time?
she's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
theoretically, i should be able to answer any questions related to my thesis.
patience, my friend. i will reveal the answer to you... but that time is not now.
the shrine maiden i tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. you'll know her when you see her.
thank you so much, miss hu tao and mister zhongli.
how much effort and resources did the sages put into this...?
this upcoming scene is the two musketeers' final confrontation with the baron. there'll be quite a bit of action, but no choreography beyond what we've already rehearsed.
okay, now move the kamera slowly.
and that's my answer to your question. d--do you have any other questions?
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me... let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
oh, really? then i won't disturb you.
oh? dear me, don't you trust me? i'm heartbroken...
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces... let's hurry back.
the path of life is long, and it's hard for us to see the destination. this leads us to ask a lot of difficult questions...
if something were to happen, my existence may be the only trump card we'll be able to play.
oh, these are the clothes that the lady chosen from the audience was wearing, right?
*sigh* you've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
oh dear. well, that's too bad.
all my martial might was in vain... though i could conquer tatarigami and vanquish monsters, i was helpless against the ravages of time, powerless to keep the ones i cherished alive.
that's right. the forbidden knowledge is no more, and your homeland should be safe now.
really? i find that hard to believe...
hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
so, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? clearly, the musou no hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
in return, i give you a blessing from me: good luck. i'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living... fulfilled lives.
is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? how does it taste? and how do you cook it?
thierry, you say? hmm, it is possible that he's figured out a way to convert the gardemeks for personal use...
...that's quite a story.
...did you really have to add that last part!?
no, it's not your fault. i'm sure he had come prepared...
turns out, pom-pom's been silently putting in a lot of work for us, wow...
i've got goldfish memory -- we haven't had a chance to say goodbye to everyone we met so far on this trip.
...yes, when the dust settles, i'll just think of a way to recall it in the memory zone.
o--okay, we trust you~!
huh? my phone... himeko! there's something really weird happening!
moving containers, picking locks... seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
as i said, the shogun has a robust system to protect her against modification. this is because i anticipated that i myself would change over time.
then, i'll head back for now. i think i need some time to fully digest everything that just happened.
i won't do anything crazy. i just want to wander around and see more of the world for myself. i want to buy some oak cake rolls. i've had a cake roll every day since i arrived in penacony, from the first day to the last.
where both will gradually fade until they completely disappear.
not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command... did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
next time you wish to see her, you can come and take the pass permit from me again. she would never admit to it, but she does, in fact, get quite lonely.
ugh... miss fu xuan, why did the simulation just cut off like that?
what you might not realize is that all too often... people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
that's why it's so important to develop close connections with your teammates.
i... get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
thanks. let's go!
hmm, it appears we are out of leads to follow... and if no one knows how this crystal works, then apep may be in danger.
twirly-whirly, i believe in you! take this crook down... *coughing*
other people might fall for that, but i won't!
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
i'm sorry. i wasn't there for the whole thing. by the time i arrived, the worst of the fighting was already over.
hehe, that's our seele. nothing if not punctual. so, did you find any usable supplies?
...march, get dan heng.
do you think topaz is around here somewhere? maybe her cronies are acting without her authorization...
prepare yourselves. i'm going to transport you into irminsul.
yes. it was too late. i arrived only in time to hear her dying breath.
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
and at the end of lyney's trial, the culprit also only dissolved the victim in front of everyone because they realized they were at risk of being identified.
hey! shh! that's a secret!
sunshines represent "warmth and love of light..." for patients on the verge of death, my dad might have been the only light to penetrate the darkness around them.
i should've been done with the first draft of my thesis by now, but i've barely written a third... *whimper*
now we just have to wait for the official news. i hope bronya doesn't keep us too long.
at that time, i was young and weak. the sages kept me in the sanctuary of surasthana, ostensibly for the sake of "protecting" me, but i've hardly heard from them since.
oh! so, it would be like... like experiencing a different life, but still as yourself? that's not a bad idea.
we're here to rescue you... are you all right?
...you do have a point. sorry, i tend to panic easily... as you can see.
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
simple. it wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? so we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
...but i think i failed. maybe... there are other things that you guys do?
so if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. relax, if i need your assistance, i won't hesitate to ask.
my intention is to help people. i'm not here to cause any harm.
but skott will definitely use the ipc's mechs. there's no way i can take them down with just a couple of swords, right?
you've done enough. treating the injured is doctor's work.
i'm sorry if i'm suddenly not making any sense. however, i do think it's possible.
worry, fear, or whatever you want to call it. hmm, if i'm connecting the dots correctly, then i think i know where the seelie is leading us.
...please, everyone, anyone, just listen to me. i swear, i really am your archon...
right. especially with someone outside of the shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
and yet, even knowing all this, i'm sure you must still have a lot of unanswered questions. i must say, i truly regret that i can't help you more as the god of wisdom...
oh well... in any case, everyone already knows full well the apathy of the chief justice.
alright, the jig is up, your voice gave it away...
...you think you look alike?
this may not sound like me, but... i hope that deity the architects worship can grant us some luck.
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
i'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason...
how could i after having such critical new evidence appear?
we must do everything we can to prevent that.
i'm sorry that i only came to visit after all this time. after what happened... i didn't know how i was supposed to face the two of you.
that's two down already! but seriously, i can't help but notice how... confusing this place is...
mmm... what's this little device here for? could you please let me know? it looks like a little button.
get going to where, mister yang?
with this last cup of tea, let us honor the tea master's memory.
but dreams are, and will forever be, just dreams. we are people living in the real world.
a dream world... i heard that penacony transformed the dreamscape into a majestic metropolis...
yeah, i've calmed down now. but it doesn't seem like there's too much we can do until we receive some new leads.
the first tenryou commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. that is why the title has been passed down within the kujou clan ever since.
my dear people. whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, i say to you -- keep faith in your ardor for justice!
do we have an agreement? well then. no backing out now.
hmm, makes sense... guess we better head over to serval's workshop then?
since i'm just an ordinary person now. they'll probably just laugh in my face if i go asking them for help...
oooh this is hard! what else should i take...
anyway, i won't take up any more of your time. you still have to record the other contestants' progress, don't you? perhaps they've had some breakthroughs while we've been chatting.
can you stay with me while i recover my energy? it shouldn't take long.
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
but with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, i need time to give it some thought.
i just hope it can help me get through this predicament.
but if that's the case, then even if you became a flying bird or swimming fish, you will still be hammering nails and cutting wood in your dreams.
we're running out of time. follow my lead and get out of irminsul as soon as possible.
if this is true, then am i... going to be a great archon like you someday?
isn't this lamp a little too obvious? it's like it's just begging us to be lit...
pfft! we took down the doomsday beast, the stellaron, and phantylia. did you really think you could stop us?
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
makoto died several hundred years ago in a war that i was not personally involved in. since then, ei has assumed the shogunate.
hee-hee, just telling it like i see it.
yes. although the fungi you normally see are capable of using elemental powers, they're merely borrowing elemental power from nature around them.
okay... thanks madam herta.
well, she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
(it would have been tough for both people to fit into that vent. they would likely have bumped into lyney as well.)
the prophecy from the stone slates found its way into society, but not many people believed it at first...
i don't care about what you believe in, who you hate, or what you've done in the name of hatred... nor do i expect you to be grateful.
"also?" hmm... i suppose it makes sense that we're not the only ones investigating such a popular legend.
he'll do! he's the one we've been looking for!
i didn't understand at the time. how can we say that we are maintaining eternity when things are constantly moving forward and evolving?
also, also! if i was really just a human, why would i dare to just put my hand in that kind of water!?
this is it! the entrance to the corridor of fading echoes victory zone!
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
the shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. the question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
the goddess dearly loves this world and all the people of simulanka. and because she loves you so much... she wants you to be able to choose your own path.
so you'll stay and keep her company, yes? don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
the message. it should've come from the traveler's akasha terminal.
mm, i'm sure.
hmm... i had a bunch of friends back then, and we would go pick wild berries in the woods.
since he saw that young woman dissolve, he was at least at the crime scene.
*sigh* i feel like... even though long-life species get to live forever...
you don't know the half of it! those ipc mechs pack a huge punch!
shh, be quiet... don't wake her up, just let her sleep peacefully. ...who's "her"? ah, well, a very weary layla who's constantly stressed about her schoolwork, of course. ...and me? hehe, i'm layla too.
no, i recognize my family's handwriting. we are all doctors after all.
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst...?
though the strike from the general was timely, its destruction was also immense. when "emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
(from the way dougier acted, he must have known from the beginning that we wouldn't be able to find any evidence.)
what! how did you guess that on your first try!?
hey, dan heng, i thought all the xianzhou generals were like jing yuan...
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
why do i feel like furina's acting a little differently today?
but i don't think he's reached the spiritual height of a god.
did you now? well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
alright, let's go to poisson! with this new lead in mind, we'll get to the bottom of my father's case for sure!
but i still want to figure out the how and the why. these kinds of dreams are novel to me as well. that's why i want to have a look at the scene your dreams have been taking place at.
humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. they cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
but my friend, kitsune saiguu, reassured me that i had nothing to worry about. she would shoulder the responsibility of protecting inazuma, and mobilize all forces at her disposal to combat the threat.
what fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet...? i sincerely look forward to them.
which means that you, svarog -- uh... you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld... for the time being.
is everything okay? wait, isn't that... peak? don't tell me he fell asleep in the middle of the road again.
very well. based on my investigation so far, i believe this next pack of monsters should be the last.
because we're asking nicely? what's with the attitude?
considering the serial disappearances case, the gardes probably kept careful records of all missing persons from around that time, regardless of age or gender.
...what? letters from vache? are you certain, mister oswell?
just some suggestions at the memory level. if something happens in everybody's memory... then that something becomes a fact.
why don't we go check out that tavern? if the novels i've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.
c--clara? ...you...
did you cultivate them yourself? thank you so much -- i'll certainly take them. melus, we do still have some empty flower pots at home, right?
that should do it! on to the next location.
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
the content is fine. now we just need to promote it.
with your help, i'm confident we'll be able to find the most frictionless way to resolve the problems plaguing this city.
exactly, this is where you and firefly encountered "death", which we now know as "dormancy". considering its connection to dreamflux reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
oh, but back to the topic of wrapping up... shouldn't you be getting back to the action to record how everything plays out? last one, then the round's over.
unfortunately for jacques, the true culprit had already considered this possibility, and had sent out another assassin.
who did this!? those monsters... slandering you in the papers wasn't enough for them, was it? they even sent people to wreck your shop...!
success! another mechanism shut down.
it's the place in the photo alright. is this... a games parlor!? what kind of problem can they possibly be facing?
hmm... from when she said "ad astra abyssosque"?
true... but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
uh, hello? is anyone home?
(his villain friends must have been waiting on the other side to buy the stellaron. he went to meet them.)
huh? is this a broadcast?
how about we check out spina di rosula's ship? we should have a view of the whole of poisson from there.
observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
it's a strong opening -- an easy way to grab the readers' attention. never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
well, we have to investigate the court at some point, right? meeting the king himself would be a fantastic opportunity to do that.
i declare you my chamberlain. in other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the shogunate and loyal to me.
there's no more hydro archon, you know... and it's still a little early to celebrate.
...if you haven't got anything nice to say right now, zip it!
supposedly, the goddess has had it all planned out for ages. one of her oldest prophecies says this:
for the children in the clinic to truly know the feeling of this view, they'd have to be here to see it themselves.
ahem... my current research is about a certain phenomenon called "astral shift."
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
hmm, i'll need some time to figure out where i went wrong here...
is this really what you want to do?
but misha can see clockie, too, right? they even grew up together, but misha hasn't started the way of the trailblaze yet...
easy, girl. i'm on your side.
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
don't underestimate beating egg whites, by the way. it's a real arm workout! you also need to beat them to just the right consistency, or your macarons will crack.
no need to be shy! even furina was shouting from the top of this mountain earlier.
come on, everyone. allons-y.
you could say that, in a sense... you'll see why shortly.
would you mind sharing it with me? i really can't believe that my father could ever bring himself to shoot jacques.
"what's the big deal? we just wanna swim!" that's what we used to say.
no... but i used to think we were so close that we may as well have been...
it's okay. i'll contact my helpers just as i did before and see if they can locate your other family members.
i noticed that i have some blurry memories after saving irminsul.
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
it hasn't been around for long, but word of the seelie's existence spread like wildfire. many people have claimed that they've received a reply from it.
that night, my father hosted a banquet at this countryside estate. he planned to meet up and exchange information with jacques over some food.
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
clorinde and i are both veteran members of the club. recently, someone came up with a new script and was looking for people to help playtest it for them.
(ahem... what's wrong with a quick route, mister yang?)
i see... anyway, i'm glad you're safe!
"foreign object"? ...that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
i do. i once had nothing but the truth, and now, i'm finally free to live my own life again. and even though i have no idea where i'm going right now...
but if you don't dare to touch it, then we would have basically proved the reverse.
hmm... given that i'd like to focus on the story, i suppose i should pick "easy mode." i'd feel bad if i brought the team down by failing my checks...
so i've been running a fool's errand this whole time.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
haven't i already made myself clear? i won't act or perform in any role ever again. no exceptions.
i never had the chance to see her one last time. but i would like to believe that she kept her promise to me until the very last.
oh? hmm... understood. thank you.
indeed. when they are presented with complex moral issues, many people will simply plug their ears and go with the flow until the problem can't be fixed anymore.
ooh, good plan! treat the robots like guard dogs!
even the air here feels more relaxing.
all in all, the mission is going super smoothly!
if nothing else, we can safely say that we accomplished what we set out to do.
it is a manifestation of the god of wisdom's power.
perhaps in your mind, you also view me as "weak"?
uh... you want us to help you? what do you need?
i would like to officially announce that our entry to the festival, "the two musketeers," has now concluded filming!
miss yae lost the match, but why is haniyyah the one who seemed upset...
how did the borisin manage to infiltrate the xianzhou?
you didn't want to listen to us! we were here to rescue you and you started a fight for no reason!
no need. there's no place for such things in my life.
darn it! he's got extra hands!
trailblazers... first time anyone's called us that on this planet!
i walk up to it, crouch down, and begin to carefully examine it. i've still got my right glove on, so it should be fine for me to touch it, right?
with the help of the sacred sakura's power, i was finally able to overcome the monsters and quell the disaster in inazuma.
stop! i know what you're gonna say: "march, you said too much back there -- march, you shouldn't reveal our goal to people we don't trust..." meanwhile you guys were beating around the bush and speaking in riddles.
a paper flower? it's beautiful... did luocha make this?
well, we're marechaussee hunters, after all. you could say that's basically our job!
i've been searching for quite a while now, but i haven't seen any sign of the swiftflies yet.
the key is that the plane of euthymia represents ei's inner world. defeat her there and you may well have the chance to shake the raiden shogun's will.
"to layla"?
my mother never had those kinds of expectations, though. i've heard that she had only one wish for me, which was that i would have a happy and secure childhood.
hmm, possibly. that sounds like a natural conclusion. so, is the road of wisdom the road that leads to the akademiya then?
it's the same routine. you've mastered it, right?
it's a grassroots organization. think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
i feel bad for making you go through so much trouble for me. if only i were more capable...
in the end, they were eaten together as a delicacy... um, but that's besides the point.
of course. thank you, master qingque.
look, look! they're reacting -- seems like they really like this name!
thanks. hmm... oh, how about i share some basics about astrology with you? if you're interested, that is.
hide-and-seek update... astral express crew -- two, the moles -- zero!
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
plus... it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.
the memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. in the memory zone of penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by black swan.
...before i left, destiny's slave told me that this journey would bring unforgettable rewards. even though the script he gave me only had a few lines, i couldn't ignore them.
we'll leave them be... svarog may have blocked off the furnace core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. an admirable deed.
i could tell you're a very kind person, but i never expected that you'd go this far to help me...
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
no, we must decipher its secrets. i've already eliminated all other factors that might affect irminsul. this is the only one left.
come onnnn! himeko and mister yang are grown-ups -- i'm sure they'll cope without us for one night.
do you have to go back already? time really flies.
nice to meet you, miss nilou! i'm navia, the president of spina di rosula. if you ever get the chance to go to fontaine, make sure you come and visit me! i'm based in poisson.
a threatening letter? what are you even talking about?
eide's out of control. i have to end this fight...
that's quite the legitimate excuse... hmm, no, it's more of an "explanation." hah, even i'm starting to get bolder with my words.
it's terrible, even for a dream.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance...
oh, th--that's completely understandable. what can i do to better gain your trust?
you... weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you...?
oh... goodness, is that the time? i have another guest to receive today. we can talk more back at the grand narukami shrine.
retreat? ha! that's not the hunter way. if it's dark for us, then it's dark for him! we choose to fight!
mm, morning... wait, morning!? how is it light out already...
hi, we meet again... what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
ah... wha... *laughs*
it's not that i don't have faith in their ability, it's just that a different perspective is required in some matters.
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
hahaha... i'm afraid that's just an inevitable consequence of my divine charm.
...in my estimation, there's no question about it. this is murder.
is that... me...? she looks exactly... like me...
huh? strange, i remember no such thing.
here, these are your wages, as promised. not a single mora short.
looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence...
anyway, that's besides the point! the point is, what are the ipc doing here on jarilo-vi?
are you talking about us this time?
perhaps, there will come a day when you'll willingly share your memories with me -- i eagerly await such a time.
in sumeru, scholars use spirit borneol to aid meditation and stimulate their connection to the dendro archon...
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
oho, now that i believe! i'm easy to work with, and always bring home the bacon; who wouldn't treasure having a partner like me?
me? i didn't do anything, seriously.
oh, and i have to ask a favor. when you give the notes to her later, please don't tell her about my existence.
...she is also, i must say, a truly unlucky person.
i'll take a look. i should be able to help if it's just a common illness...
in that case, the vote stands at two to one.
which would be when we had first saved the desert.
these are the crystallization of his wisdom. yes, i was worried that the material might cause some disruption, but i didn't want to wipe away all his hard work searching for the truth.
do you remember? a long time ago, when we traveled between worlds together...
yes. as i told you once before, there's information about your twin in irminsul.
how was it? did you dream of me?
i've learned that emotions are nothing like knowledge, and that's why it's hard for me to put them into words sometimes.
even if we'd done nothing at all, shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
i'll do what i can. thank you.
if you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
so the mutual aid society found my bro-- ...vache's research results... and now they're selling this so-called "wonder medicine" to patients...?
i know it's tough to believe all this without reservations. i just want to say you're very close to the final answer -- just one more thing needs to be done, and then i can prove it to you...
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
this view is nothing like the views in belobog... if my brother were still alive and standing here on the express, i wonder what he'd make of all this.
you rather sealed my fate there, with your "special thanks" at the end of the show.
if i get another chance, i'll practice even harder and won't ever lose again!
to be fair, though, it was a really flattering feature, hahaha... so we've been on pretty good terms ever since.
really? we know you're pretty busy...
miss tingyun, are the long-life species on the xianzhou... all like this?
i never knew the fateometer even determines the amount of damage you inflict... if you get unlucky, isn't it just game over right then and there?
hmph. who did that uncivilized rabble think they were, disturbing my enjoyment of the arts?
well, technically there aren't any seats... but anyways!
oh, that's probably because the prophecy about the "hero of simulanka" has been around for a very long time.
ever heard of the tabletop troupe? they put out games that allow you to participate in a story and roleplay characters with your friends. i've loved their stuff ever since i was a kid.
...the overall outcome indicates that the cost was worth it.
everything about home is filled with purity and passion. my memories of that place are wonderful. i never want to forget them.
what should we do about these clothes everywhere? need any help?
for a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the tenryou commission is nigh on impossible.
don't you have something cool to say, like "appearances can be deceiving"?
hey, what's that commotion? it sounds like there's a big argument happening...
yay, we did it! can't see the smoke anymore.
...hold on... if the watchmaker really was a nameless, wouldn't that make him your predecessor? would you like to take a picture with him?
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
sinthe is still here, "callas the unfaithful" is still his epithet, and spina di rosula is barely getting by. nothing has changed.
his figure gradually disappeared into the snow curtain... i've been telling myself that vache is dead ever since.
maybe it's because i've finally become an ordinary person, and gained my freedom, that i've developed a great sense of curiosity about their lives.
why don't you go meet up with the others first? they should all be waiting at chioriya boutique. i'll come over with the script manager as soon as i find them.
maybe not... we don't have any way to prove whether certain memories were simply forgotten, or never existed in the first place.
is this really the right place...? it's so quiet all of a sudden.
oh yeah, there are some people we haven't said goodbye to yet!
just some shallow intuition... anyway, let's report back to the sheriff for now.
if i make an exception to the rule now, i'm just leaving a backdoor for myself. which would be the same as not having a boundary in the first place.
aha! i found something. "to whoever discovers this diary"... let's see...
oh no, they saw right through it...
youhei, i suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. this is a life-or-death situation.
well, our war torn bear here just became a priceless doll. not bad, junjun.
good. why were those ipc workers threatening you?
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle... i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
it's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. but in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
alright, alright. don't get all sentimental on me.
whenever i made a mistake in an experiment, he'd bite my head off... and then a while later, he'd apologize and comfort me. he was conflicted in that way.
opennnn sesame~!
if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
if this deal with the balladeer can give you the answers you've been longing to find, then it's worth it.
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something... and that'd just be too sad.
i'll go together with you -- perhaps we'll find the exit just up ahead.
well, what do you expect? i am the courageous and considerate president of spina di rosula, after all, like my father before me.
look, he's still talking to that cowboy!
also, we're not your friends. why should we care if a stellaron hunter is innocent, hmm~?
that's more like it! as expected, my dazzling side comes through in any situation.
...though those who play by our rules call me "boss."
hold your horses, cowboy. it's for those to decide.
the family recruited many artists, architects, and scholars from across the universe to form the team of dreamweavers that built the dream of penacony.
if you get hit by the musou no hitotachi, that's it. it's game over. i would get training if i were you.
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
each time he finished a tricky operation, my mom and i would buy a single stem of sunshine, then pin it on the chest pocket of his apron.
is there any chance the seelie could have taken the books out and returned them without being noticed...?
i'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
don't worry, welt and himeko will have our backs if things go wrong. let's just make the most of it all while we're here.
so i won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. what matters is that i tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
there are still so many things i never got to tell him... so many questions he still owes me answers to...
his last experiment was nearly two years ago. what happened after that? his notes seem to suggest he was working to improve blizzard immunity.
rivals...? why the heck are we rivals now? what are you talking about?
the end of the story needs to focus back on aurelie herself. she's the true star of the show.
qlipoth the preservation is known for their... indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
otherwise, i think she would have given me a little more guidance, and i could have done a better job.
i've thought about it, and... well, if i were bronya, i wouldn't sign it.
we're counting on you, welt. as for us... let's get ready to see the dreamscape's true visage.
confidence goes a long way.
water as a conscious entity... there's actually quite a few stories that explore this theme.
*sigh* you say that every time, and then...
we had previously come into contact with his consciousness. he harbors particularly strong obsessions...
huh!? so these are rooftops? how long would snow have to fall to get this thick?
this is the dream jigsaw, right? so, we're supposed to find the exit? but where can we find the last piece...?
so... they thought she had betrayed them?
really? hehe... among my childhood friends, i was considered one of the more athletic ones.
holding a cultural convention featuring light novels!
flipping through this book is akin to personally listening to the guests' stories and their heartfelt wishes... yes, here it is. my message.
that place up ahead is aideen park -- everything here is themed around soulglad. it's a little crowded, so make sure you stay close to me.
really? then it seems... what kafka taught me was correct.
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
congratulations, little ones. you've passed the third round of the test of courage.
message not sent? why not?
in the end, oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the underworld.
an "ambition" is a yearning for something material, or a concrete outcome. it is finite in nature, and will be replaced by a new ambition in due course.
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
after ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
(this is the spot. there are several fungi here.)
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
as for the suffering... well, i will admit that the first thing that came to mind was, "why do i have to be the one to suffer?"...
i've yet to see anything strange about this place.
always thrilled to hear you're in good health. but i was really asking about your emotions. have you managed to calm down?
haha, just kidding! there's no way that i'd accept that kind of compliment at face value. at a minimum, i'd have to match what my father did for the people.
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too...
hehe, i'll take the compliment.
we'd better hurry to the underworld and see what natasha and seele make of it all...
come on, say something already.
this is the address where i arranged to meet up with the almighty merchant. and here's the list of ingredients. thanks again...
(the stamp... hmm, which probably means they're a rtawahist student...)
then... what's going to happen to miss robin? she and sunday won't be able to deny their involvement in the charmony festival, they're siblings after all...
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
yes, you can say that. when we were fighting against the sinthe dealers, they provided us with plenty of support.
the plane of euthymia. essentially, the world inside her mind. a place that typically only allows her existence.
the story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. also, there are a great many legends about rex lapis. i'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
and have you made any headway on that? the true cause, i mean?
but only if you feel this is something that would help, of course.
get some sleep if you're tired. i'll be up, it's not like i can sleep anyways.
people refer to you as "the heroes who managed to rescue a god." i am quite fond of this name. it not only explains your identities, but also bears witness to your relationship with me.
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
this is some incredible cooking! next time we head out together, looks like i should carry the ingredients and cookware, and let you be the chef.
looks like the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.
during the festival, most of the yae publishing house's editors will be staying near the outlander affairs agency. if you run into any problems, you may find them there.
oh please, spare me that look. i didn't sign up for any of this. i'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me...
this is useful to know. with any luck, it'll help us work out the seelie's identity.
i wonder who this gift could be from.
it was an award i used to give the kids in rivet town for "good behavior." can you imagine what an orphanage is like with so many difficult children? i had to come up with a solution to get them to behave.
when i returned to the arena, they were already quite a distance away. it didn't feel right to run after them and ask what they were up to...
...i have no idea what you're talking about.
but once, i saw melus come back wounded. he wouldn't tell me how he'd been injured, but i could tell that it had something to do with me.
the script writer must have used a real-world city as a reference when coming up with the map.
wouldn't you rather find out the answer for yourself than ask someone else? the fantastic mirage represents the "deep dream," the most fundamental reflection of the human heart.
little miss pink... what's that supposed to mean!?
...someone's been following you.
all the memories seem to be set in or near vimara village, but i'm still not sure if they're restricted to this location.
the people answered the call of the architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
and your main goal, for which you gave up everything you had... you weren't able to achieve it. i hope you can see and understand that.
(this guy seems promising enough. maybe i can get some information out of him!)
remember my adoptive parents i mentioned to you a while ago?
but all my efforts proved to be futile in the end. really, the truth has been clear to me for a very long time...
these should be enough to get by for a bit longer. be careful. don't push yourselves too hard.
(but i just don't understand. how did she do it? and what does "pawn" really mean? i should go back and ask...)
whoa! you're awesome, mister tail!
want to come with me again, you two? you don't mind, do you, colter?
i don't believe you... you're hiding something from me, it's written all over your face.
so... you're saying you'll help us out? i knew i could count on you, partner!
whatever. what else do you know? how did you come to the conclusion that i'd be in grave danger?
hehe, you're right. people still rely on me as their doctor.
the diviner said i need to provide something from my past experiences...
as much as i'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, i suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
she's the big shot! definitely got that "queen of the castle" vibe going on. aww, so cool.
he even hid the fact that my mother died due to complications when giving birth to me...
we should be able to see more from up above, but how do we get up there?
hehe, this is something that will become very important to us further down the line. alright, it's time to move on to the next phase of the plan.
if we lose control over our consciousness, we will fall into madness... so let's make sure the boat stays on course.
but you look like you've got something on your mind... come on, out with it!
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur...
everyone's waiting for you, so hurry up and pack. we're leaving as soon as you're ready!
...thank you. i can't even imagine what you've been through up there. i'm just glad everything turned out alright.
also... the doctor is already an expert at modifying akasha terminals. maybe it's only a matter of time until he captures my consciousness inside the akasha.
ah, hello little ones. i take it you have received my commission, hmm?
so think hard about what that means. and then think again about what you hope to achieve by arguing with each other.
sounds fun, but there's a chance it won't suit my mom's taste. let me think...
nice! you found footage of him leaving?
this game allows people to work on themselves, or form strong bonds by teaming up with others. harmless rivalry is a great way for people to settle their differences.
ready? one, two, three...
seele's already become a capable adult -- i can't treat her like a child anymore.
let's head towards the first victory zone -- corridor of fading echoes!
look up there... if we can push that thing down, do you think that would do the trick?
unfortunately, people nowadays only crave to be thrilled, and a mere duel will not slake their thirst for excitement!
well... it's not like we have any other options. unless you wanna do the honors, paimon? fancy flying up there on your own?
whew... give me a second to wrap my head around all of this...
i guess so, but that still doesn't fix bronya's problem...
and even if that's the case... there's no reason for it to simply shatter... unless...
thanks for the concern, kaveh. i just... haven't been sleeping well lately...
be serious! i really wanna know...
that being said, opening a bar in this place... filled with monsters... is quite a feat. siobhan must have a lot of tricks up her sleeve, right?
i... um...
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
creating a deity was just the first step. some of them wanted to be able to control it. that's why they backed up his memory for later use.
and now that everything is over, all the hatred that you harbor has lost its meaning. rather than continuing to fight, you should consider the life you've produced.
if you tell her the truth at that point, she should be a lot less disappointed.
i've read "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." it has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
among the countless dreams, i found one that was growing fainter and fainter. this proved my suspicion.
you mean... there are many different versions of you in this world?
well, we didn't get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top ipc executive!
hey there, clara! huh? is svarog not around?
vilmant? the one who's playing the role of the villain?
i do not plan to deny the power of longing. such an intense but unquantifiable emotion could indeed have the power to organize dreams.
go and meet your friend. we can meet up in qiaoying village later!
i hope that you will be free of this pain after returning home.
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge...
i used to be terrified of the gaze of other people, especially when they had suspicion or resentment in their eyes.
haha, that's right, you tell them! and that's why they're partners of mine. they've managed to turn things around!
(so what! this is the tea society, remember?)
the bro or the sis? if you're talking about gepard, we should be careful... he's a top silvermane guard -- he'd probably get a medal for every one of us he brought in.
so you could actually hear what she was saying! why didn't you say so earlier? i thought someone was really in trouble!
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back... or maybe i'm just describing myself.
the unconscious fungus is just below here. can you all help me determine which one it is?
aha, you're learning, little one. but really, the truth of the matter is that i don't know much more about raiden makoto's realm of consciousness than you do.
it just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
so i'm not going to perform, and that is that.
let's just forget about that part. he's already in such a sorry state.
(if you let this opportunity slip through your fingers, it might never come by again.)
you talked to kiara, but didn't ask her to keep things secret. people curious to know asked around for information. then, it was only a matter of time before word of the threatening letter spread all across fontaine.
they've been tormented by forbidden knowledge for a long time. it's understandable that they will eventually become the withering.
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
no, it seems that my birth and her death took place at the same time.
whoa! was that a lucky guess? *gasp* did you go to a music festival without us?
you should know that these actions make you an enemy of the astral express.
you start missing those moments once you leave them behind... and that's a part of moving forward.
the great mine's just down here. the ipc should have the venue all sorted by now.
camera, check. extra clothes, check. toiletries...
secondly, you're probably wondering why people don't have any memories from earlier samsara, right?
no matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
it's very pleasant here. even the wind brushing against my toes feels soft and gentle. so of course, i love it.
hehe, that'll teach you to underestimate us three.
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
so it's... made up? what's the point of that? without being grounded in reality, how can the story be believable?
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
yeah, because i wouldn't just let him keep getting his way! he was just... *sigh* not very agreeable.
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
we should proceed with caution. the kujou clan descendant may well be in trouble.
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
but aren't all of those things nothing compared to the loss of jacques?
the people whose families were destroyed by sinthe abuse, the people who lost their loved ones to the serial disappearances, and the people who suffered tragic ends due to their sense of justice...
i don't know what we're looking for yet, but we've still got some time. as attorneys, i suggest the two of you think the case over again.
and if it's a form of knowledge, then it can be understood.
the past is set in stone, but you can keep moving on. and the longer your future lasts, the shorter your past will become, until one day it is but a tiny fraction of your life.
not yet -- don't forget the elite player that mister giovanni mentioned.
oh? what's with these looks? perhaps the welcoming ceremony still isn't enough? hmm, what else should i say then?
huh? what are you saying...?
i didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was... she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
i feel so much better now that i've gotten some food in me... delicious food really does wonders for one's spirits.
hat guy, you're okay! wait, what about the dragon... durin?
there are wounded everywhere...
i never thought i'd receive a family portrait of my very own, especially not like this. seems like i'm not such an unlucky person after all.
i am not callas, and i will also never become him. the spina and the poisson that you loved are both gone.
hmph, do you even know who you're talking to? if your boss knows to treat us with respect, you'd better start showing some yourself!
nothing? i thought there was an answer for every single permutation.
actually, i have no idea...
um... maybe we should just grab some takeout.
so it's a recording device. diting must have heard its signal and called us over here to investigate.
had you not helped me to resolve the crisis, not only i, but sumeru and even the entirety of teyvat, would've suffered great misfortune.
but i'd really prefer not to talk about this stuff. and what do you mean by "saving me a trip"!? i'd make the journey even if i had to visit you two somewhere else.
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
living in the underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. i'd rather trek through the frigid snow plains than live in a beautiful cage.
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan...
there you go, a small parting gift. if one day, you unfortunately fall into the deep waters of the memory zone and there's no memokeeper to join you -- hopefully it can guide you on my behalf.
let me guess -- time, karma... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
i think i'll just... take a quick nap... just a quick one...
besides, this has only come about because i failed to make a timely decision. this issue started with me, and i shall be the one to finish it.
are you all there? here, like last time, repeat after me--
just a suggestion though -- you're safe as long as you stick with me~!
the call is yours. we still have time to re-shoot an ending if that's what you'd like.
which is exactly why the spina di rosula exist.
it has the ability to purify and stabilize powers that shouldn't exist in teyvat.
i used all the power i had to keep her dying dream alive as long as possible, but it still wouldn't have lasted for much longer if it hadn't been for you two breaking the samsara.
(so tired... so sleepy... i just wanna eat up and get to bed...)
uh-oh, he's gonna fall. catch him!
training fungi... and then domesticating them?
ahh, juice... if i say the word, i get a craving. if i get a craving, i wanna drink some. and if i drink some... ahh... i can't stop!
well, your troubles are written on your face, silly! i'm always observing you, you know.
during our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by mister sunday...
"'sweet dream' is no dream, yet it nurtures people's dreams."
alright, anyway... that's the information i wanted to share with you -- even if it did sound like i was just complaining towards the end.
no, it doesn't seem to be her.
(hmm, i think i heard somewhere that it has a lot of ridiculous abilities...)
well, it's not often we have the chance to chat. i'm sure you must have a lot of questions?
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already...
but dreams also have the potential to exploit people, confuse the senses, and distort the truth. unfortunately, you were all chosen as prey for an elaborate scheme.
...wait, what do you mean, "either"?
uh, hello, i'm a rtawahist student and would like to see the checkout logs for "theoretical astrology" and "a quick reference guide to astrology cases."
i wouldn't have put it past them to try and nab that stellaron from inside you.
hmm, so... in the end, we still have to start by talking to neuvillette...
all the shots had great composition, and i could really feel a connection to the characters and their lines...
huh... who's wilder? ...and what's "aetherium wars"?
there must be something wrong with how i installed the mechanism. it was my first time putting one of those rods together!
makoto and you are inazuma's past and future, and both are indispensable.
hehe, i suppose so. once they're done writing the manuscript, i'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
look, diting found a strange chest... and there's a hand print on it...!
the magician twins could have committed the crimes, of course, but they lack any logical motive.
(*sigh* fine, i'll be me. you guys will have to imagine his lines instead.)
face it head-on? wh--what should i do? do you really think i can...?
an interesting answer. but if you ask me, i think all emotion shall ultimately return home to the heart, and slowly settle with the passage of time.
but on some level, freedom also means no longer being needed. i have no further use to people.
can you do me a favor and try to recall what happened that night?
if you had used your talents and determination for a just cause, you could have become a sage of the new generation.
hmmm... honest kid. i know where you are, miss sparkle.
yes. they're both dragons but apep, the dendro dragon, has been around for longer and has accumulated dense elemental power...
i think it's high time detective march took the gloves off.
well, i made sure to take good care of it! considering the... circumstances in which you gave it to me, of course i had to keep it safe.
don't worry, paimon. this is my responsibility. the fire seed is technically just a ball of highly concentrated elemental power.
however, we are both born of elemental power and both suffered the torment of forbidden knowledge.
i... i don't remember... it's a blank canvas...
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences... and can come to represent what we seek the most.
questionable motives? ...me? w--wait, huh?
in other words, dreams are rich bundles of human wisdom.
everything in this space will be wiped from existence... including all memory of our reunion.
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
i am the boss of spina di rosula, after all. this may be my first time as a king, but there are a few similarities between the two roles.
...i'm afraid that what you're thinking right now is correct...
thank you for the meal. i thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
it's okay, i understand. you must have some important things on your plate? don't let them get ahead of you.
the law only judges criminal behavior, and does not weigh human emotion. the court's verdict can settle the question of criminal liability, but...
we both came from the overworld. maybe that's why we're so eager to turn back the clock -- to return to when life below ground was no harder than life on the surface.
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia... he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair...
oh, and you don't need to worry too much about the sages' activities for now. the akasha won't be able to conduct another project on the scale of the sabzeruz samsara in the immediate future.
trust me. when have i ever been wrong about something like this?
...do you think the great mine was affected by our fighting on the surface?
(this isn't working.)
this stool is a piece of evidence, right?
scorching hot days and freezing cold nights... i--i don't think i'm gonna make it...
(they are still a ball of fire as ever.)
i see... but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
this is the end. you have won.
indeed, my dear, loyal citizen, this joyous moment is an honor for us both!
mhm. you may blame me for being a bit too self-indulgent. i was thinking about talking with you, and the next thing i knew, i had made a connection with you.
one need only to turn their eyes towards the oratrice mecanique d'analyse cardinale in this very opera house, or consider the indemnitium that is used in every aspect of life.
oh, has night fallen already? then you'd best go have a rest.
my body... i can't move it.
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
they're definitely up to something bad. wait, they disappeared? let's catch up to them!
okay, but please keep it a secret between us from now on! please don't ever mention it again!
it means that this "professor aisha" she keeps mentioning might have foreseen the danger, and was prepared to never return.
your match is over too? you took your time. i'm assuming it was a close call...
ah, that's right. as a small token of compensation for playing that little trick on you with the empty light cone, i will gift you with some words -- they hold great significance to me...
*yawn* ...so tired. i just wanna put my head on a pillow and drift off...
hehe, it would be rather boring if i had arranged every last detail in advance. the chance encounter between you and haniyyah came as quite a pleasant surprise.
he was granted the power to connect with irminsul when he almost became the god of a new era. even though he no longer has the gnosis, some traces of its power remain in him. he can still connect.
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
me? i'm just the newbie president that's running around and causing everyone trouble.
it's my pleasure, really. you're sumeru's hero! you've more than earned it.
jade stone can be pawned off, but not everything can be used in an exchange. outside of life itself, there are more valuable things that i don't want to give up.
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
hehe, you should prepare yourself. i certainly won't go easy on you.
instead of being interested in the end product, it's like he's enjoying the experimental process.
mm... too late, the moment's gone!
i do admire his vision and perseverance, even though "blizzard immunity" always seemed unachievable to me.
"keeper"? you mean guard, right?
then this stone tablet must have been left behind by their companions.
i see. it's as i thought, then. as your god, i did already expect this, but i wanted to see how far your human wisdom would allow you to analyse it.
you saw it all for yourselves. i'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
took you long enough sleepy head. we've been waiting all day!
could you be any less discreet!?
yeah, who's that? are they some sort of gaming prodigy?
since we're all refreshed, ready to head out for the day?
ahh... what a mess! i really want a nice cool drink of soda to help me calm down...
hold on, let us explain! we're not--
i told you, it's purely out of a spirit of competitiveness.
it's f--freezing here -- the blizzard's so fierce! the power from the trailblaze path isn't enough to stop the cold...
the one who hired you to come to penacony probably doesn't want you secretly linking up with other forces, right?
did you get enough sleep? if you're still tired, you should go back to sleep for a bit... me? *sigh* i'm... used to it...
how's the journey been? if there's something weighing you down, let me do a little divination for you...
these are... records of his experiments.
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
whew... all that running around has worn me out.
if i can narrow the search, it'll make my life a whole lot easier. i won't have to buy hundreds of different things and get twirly-whirly to try them all...
hey, you should tell us more about that fight against the geovishap some time! maybe your master was onto something, hehe!
...how is that gonna improve our chances?
come. let me give you a list of materials we need.
a little earlier, we suddenly heard a loud noise. at first, everyone thought that something might have exploded in the waterways, but before we knew it, water started pouring out from everywhere.
of course, it would have been more stressful for shingo and youhei that way, hehe. still, the experience may ultimately have been more effective than me scaring them into submission with a little exaggeration.
not bad at all. i'm glad you finally got to reveal the tricks you've been keeping up your sleeve.
no need. this is merely a memokeeper's duty.
let me see... ah! of course!
this should be our final stop. setaria is always thinking of this restaurant when she's working at the akademiya, so she always comes by whenever she's out in the city.
the next part of the story requires us to solve the puzzle, right? let's start exploring the area.
precisely. according to the rules i designed for her, matters of this nature are to be delegated to the tri-commission.
yeah, and that's when i started having sleeping problems... i just began to sleep less and less each day.
everything in this world runs in a loop... this cycle is called a "samsara." you, me, and everyone else are all stuck inside a one-day samsara...
dan heng's speculations are usually right on the money. but even if we've guessed right, we can't go home now.
well, it is what it is. you know what my father was like -- even i often struggled to figure out what was going on in his head.
yes, this is it! thank you so much!
right now, let's follow her train of thought and head to the next puzzle. i hope this time we can get ahead of the bloodhound family. i want to try and avoid using my memokeeper powers.
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
*sigh* looking back, it wasn't. he deserved much worse...
hee-hee, yup! when you're free, let's head over to the divination commission together and ask them for a favor.
oh, you beat me to it. looks like your brain is intact.
don't you think a tournament like this makes a perfect candidate for light novel treatment?
you want to... create a situation where all three parties are present?
i see. i'll be sure to remember that.
huh!? you mean that stellarons can communicate? i've never heard that before...
you bring honor to the title of "guardian of eternity."
yeah, that makes sense... general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
(in truth, the third person shot jacques first, and was shot in turn by my father when my father seized the gun from him.)
young people should be energetic! here, let's do some relaxation exercises.
decades...? but i'll be an old lady by then... no, no.
(is it such an outrageous thing to do, anyway? to find someone in whom you can confide your frustrations and sorrows? surely, it could not hurt?)
but it's fine if you want to give it a shot... i trust your judgment.
why don't we try using the lamps' heat-transferring properties?
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
suspects!? that's not good...
hehe, but that would only be the case if he cared about what others thought. my father was always really stubborn. once he made up his mind, good luck getting him to change it.
twirly, quick! do the thing... the wind vortex!
don't worry. if my assessment is correct, though there may be some minor disturbances, it won't lead to a disaster. please rest and recover your strength here until i say it's safe.
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them...
hmm? what are you talking about? what do you mean the "other" layla...? i am layla.
a kite, a parasol, a little tin frog that jumps... oh, and a stuffed toy of a mythical beast...
so, you mean... the ones who scoured the settlement for me were also from the spina...
yes, it's something really, really good, and i'm very thankful for it.
whew, good thing azzam was willing to hear me out...
um, no need. i'll handle the clinic. i assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
there's no need for this. there is no point in fighting, what we need is the truth.
...and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible... factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
mister sampo, take a closer look... this is a wonderful smoked red herring.
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone... just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
when you give someone the truth, you give them a chance to choose their own destiny.
like i said, i've already explained everything!
unbelievable... how could all these problems happen in just one day?
recite the incantation in your heart, little one. also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head -- a wish, for example.
...you can always find them.
the place you are going to is called rivet town. follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
really? have they found anything?
shh! it's an old astral express escape signal. do you play cards?
yep, paimon's right. we cannot fully rule out the chance that the meet-up tonight is just a trap.
lefton's suspicion level can be downgraded.
aaaah!!! how come it hurt even more than the other two!? hmph, at least that's the final step...
veronique, do we have any other spare ones we can use?
you are the enemy of eternity...
seems like only dan heng has a kind word for my coffee. what do you think? ...well, i've always thought that bitter is better...
well? feeling less worried now?
i still remember the first time we met. you were too scared to join our picnic and hid behind ms. petronilla the whole time.
it's not a perfect solution, but hopefully it means you won't have to lie low while you're here.
seems like perkins picked up a stammer?
a touching story, a magnificent venue, and last but not least, a passionate and dedicated cast!
ooh... so many options. i'm seeing stars already.
when i first saw it, i was in awe too. the sky here, it's like... a reflection of the twelve dreamscapes.
falling asleep in a place like this... impressive!
(it looks like it's in a good mood, and is waiting for another fungus.)
the sabzeruz festival is happening every day, but that doesn't mean we can waste an infinite amount of them. hurry and find the truth before today's festival ends.
they would be under neuvillette's jurisdiction. unfortunately, i uh... don't have any connection with them at all.
we need to get permissions from her? what's she got to do with this?
i was wondering... if this troupe is so important to all of you, why does it have to disband?
(is he talking about how no one in the capital seems to remember the hunters and their legacy? i didn't expect the script to contain this level of social criticism...)
i... think we should leave this matter to the belobogians... don't you agree?
the auction... right hook? the one at the vagrant camp?
as sumeru's deity, it is my responsibility to be on guard against the balladeer. but as someone who counts you as a friend, i want to do something for you.
it's embarrassing to be out of breath so quickly like this...
huh... how can this be? did i underestimate the caliber of this material?
ah, it's too late for regrets... i'll let that one go.
is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
that doesn't sound like too much of a bad thing, to be honest.
wait, we came here to fight the dragon as well. why don't we go together?
in the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the navigator mentioned... we'll have to try a little harder.
"we have decided to make you confess all your crimes in person. the time for change is now, your twisted desires will be stripped away by us."
however, to wake up everyone in penacony and get them to share the same determination... that would be nearly impossible.
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
exactly! so, best of luck with impersonating them.
a pile of clothing was found at the scene. the gardes once believed they were used by jacques as a costume to disguise himself...
...slow down -- you haven't completely recovered. seele, don't pressure him... let him rest.
it's actually not too bad. my perspective in this form isn't much different from usual.
maybe i should take off my hat, and let the snowflakes fall onto my face... i feel like that would be really refreshing.
deal. i can't believe you won such a valuable item. junjun must have fetched a small fortune, huh?
yes, this is definitely it. she made it herself -- it's the only one of its kind.
i think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
hi there, have you heard of the legend of the wisdom seelie?
how did you become affected by forbidden knowledge?
well, we don't want to act in haste before the situation has stabilized. we need to wait for the right time.
and i'm always scared that i'll miss something important... ugh, i'll never be able to forgive myself if that happens!
it's clear that in each of the erroneous samples, one of the stars underwent a significant shift. this means that...
if i understood correctly, there are currently two problems in the kingdom that need solving, right?
it must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
hopefully, there won't be any more interruptions. this time, we should be able to meet greater lord rukkhadevata.
i can't deny that i am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his vision, but i rather think the shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him... okay, fine. i'll give it some more thought.
it's a really long story. we shouldn't disturb her. her consciousness is still weakened.
let's write about inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? i can help with this one. we can use the vision hunt decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
is there a way to make them revert to their elemental form?
ah, uh... it's nothing, really. there are actually some other factors that i've been speculating about...
imagine if all the traveler ever thought about was making you stronger, forcing you to build rock-hard muscles just to watch you send mitachurls flying... would you gladly comply?
your existence is more than just an opportunity. it's the very key to all of this. to that i say... well done, child, you did not disappoint me after all.
as far as i can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
of course not! i spent the whole night reading the novel from cover to cover, marking sections that either need to omitted or adapted.
could she be tired out from her cosmic concert tour? insisting on performing under such circumstances, miss robin is a superstar among celebrities!
...another recurring dream?
...instead, he did something closer to creating hallucinations. that was still within my power to fix.
i'm good, everything seems normal...
you know, ei never said goodbye to me before she stepped into the plane of euthymia.
why is our opponent... soulglad?
got it! we'll get out of your way, then. bye!
all the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that i added to our novel?
hehe. come, let's pay a visit to the venue in ritou together. i promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
of course i am! i bought tons of fun things to bring home with me!
my dear demoiselles... uh, ladies... no, uh, i mean... friends! please take me with you!
come onnnn, you were the most excited last time we got off the train!
alright, i'm ready. changing into a fungus should be quite an interesting experience.
wait, so while you seemed to be playing with your phone, you were actually arranging things with moze? are all yaoqing people as quick as you?
th--that's not how it's supposed to go...
but your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
if i'm not mistaken... we've already met him somewhere, haven't we?
well, it's just an expression, really -- one that i just learned from clorinde, and used on the spot... so let's invite her to explain in detail. a round of applause, please!
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
i think we're all set. time to depart.
don't say that... you and your subordinates did everything you could.
oh... *sobbing*
thank you so much, everyone... then i'll be brave and just accept everyone's support for what it is...
i see. yes, this is an important relationship, so he must choose wisely, but the decision-making process is a source of agony and conflict.
well, in that case, let's take a short breather here.
what do i have to do to get you to yell from the top of this mountain? name your price.
oh? you recognized me right away. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
so we'll take that elevator on the central platform to go down to the master control zone. do you know the way?
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
i still think we should keep an eye out for romeuf's folks, though. if he decides to ignore the warning i gave his men...
if fate is the ultimate knowledge, then your future will be the ultimate fate.
it's difficult. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
you mean, what happened after the doctor put you to sleep?
ei seeks eternity. to her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
yup! i always dreamed of a head-scratcher like this -- a chance to showcase my detective genius.
right. the forest isn't the only place where strange things have been happening to the residents. have you come across the "gift from the goddess of prophecy" yet?
i knew it... no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
was the other puzzle piece... taken away by it?
pleasure to meet you, miss topaz. i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
oh? am i really so terrifying? well then, i'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up...
oh, what a coincidence. i guess i just need to catch it now, right?
you mean... leave the plane of euthymia?
well... how else was i supposed to save your skin from the balladeer, exactly?
yes. this is the strongest piece of evidence we have to go on.
from mediating disputes and providing protection, to solving conundrums -- you name it, spina di rosula does it.
listen to me, listen to me, everyone... please don't give me such cold and disdainful looks. what happened just now didn't prove a single thing!
...if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
don't let her carefree nature fool you -- she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
as always, to follow in the footsteps of akivili.
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like... hair accessories or brooches?
i've seen the caliber of the other akademiya students, they're all geniuses and fast learners. i'm nowhere near as gifted as they are...
right! i bet you're quite familiar with them, too.
that's your big reveal? the important part is: we're from a different planet!
ei, how are you feeling now?
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
but you don't belong to this world. perhaps you are just the company she needs.
then let's stay here a bit longer. anyone want snacks?
svarog wants to preserve humanity, but he's not concerned about what humans truly think.
wait a minute, we're not done here! you dragged us to the underground -- so what's the big idea?
and then... since melus loved using shorthand, i decided to also follow his example, and come up with some shorthand of my own.
the grand notion of eternity she once held has long since given way to the eternity of her own definition.
...i thought i told you that it won't help to bring anyone here.
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
i can instantly tell which students are asking serious questions and which are just trying to take advantage of me to slack off.
...me? have we met?
okay, looks like we've learned all the essentials -- let the fun begin!
yes we did, we just fell upwards.
anyway. now that i have been defeated by you and your plan, i will honor your wish to abolish the vision hunt decree.
i'm sorry, i'm not very knowledgeable in that area.
you're right. i can't always be like this... sometimes, it's better to take action than overthink every little thing.
venti...
himeko! you finally spared a thought for us!
eventually, i managed to return with a few adventurers i ran into along the way.
the hint for the final question was a little too obvious.
i'm sorry to interrupt your celebration, but... have you noticed that what's happening here doesn't quite match up with your memories?
...there's no need to knock us out this time, right?
do i even need to say it? i think we're becoming fast friends... isn't that enough?
huh, okay... any particular reason?
sometimes you remind me of a sumpter beast, plodding along with a big pack full of materials and supplies.
why would he leave exalting sanctum via a secluded dock? that's so suspicious!
i love their oak cake rolls! i get one from here every day!
you're right. the more challenging it gets, the harder i should try.
hey, i've never missed my target!
have you been down to the beach by any chance?
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
not there. come back.
good. in that case, with regard to the matter at hand, let's vote to decide our next move.
heh, we've wrapped up most of the rebuilding, but there are still a few things left to take care of.
i saw the game was called "akitsu yuugei." i'm guessing it originated from "akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura." the thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
is that pela? looks like she's teaching the kids again.
...are you done ordering? you... you have great taste! haha... i... i'll get the bill...
hehe, now we're talking like a serious acting troupe!
alright, alright, stop joking around. the lightning-lord may be all-powerful, but they're not going to cause sudden memory loss. i'm just glad you're fine.
i need to make some preparations. since i'm now free, i can establish a direct link to the akasha and control it.
you know, i was just thinking... how did the two of you meet?
we'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. there's a bit of time left before we jump. in the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
at least she's not trying to arrest us anymore.
...now's not the time for those thoughts. i need to focus on treating the injured.
ah, the one from chioriya boutique! hello, hello.
so you're one who will try to change fate, then?
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
...what's wrong, mister yang? see anything fishy?
which means they were definitely here, right?
mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
woohoo! the coast is clear!
do you not know how to wield a blade...? or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
you... when did you get here?
...yeah, i really like them, so what.
mmm, fresh food is the best. i feel like i've traveled back in time.
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you...
uh, eh-he... this interpretation is sounding a little odd... do we have any other evidence?
what he went through today would have been like living an entire lifetime in an instant. he'll need some time to calm down.
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow... none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
that's true... seems my father really had no choice...
what are those people... i mean, those "monsters" we just dealt with?
i say that our powerful magician, mister lyney, is now the prime suspect for the serial disappearances case.
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
you're saying that the real tingyun is still...
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
whatever the case, the only way we'll know is if we go there.
y'know... i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request...
they say kids grow up really fast. yanqing, are you a little bit taller than before?
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
that depends on how you define "good" and "bad."
now talk. who are you, and why were you tailing us?
brr! how do people living in all this snow celebrate anything...?
let me see... metal plates, gauze bandages, painkillers, rubbing alcohol... perfect, that's everything i needed.
time to broaden our horizons again.
clearly, everyone needs to take a step back for now, and reflect on what really matters. when emotions are running high, things get lost in the fray.
...and if you run into any trouble, you can try asking for wildfire.
youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. whatever shall we do?
i think you made the right decision. still, it means i'm going to have to draw up a detailed dosage plan.
the first one is clearly a result of your own doing... but i do admit to consuming the last serving of the express special.
did he think i'd just accept his meaningless death, and live out my life just as meaninglessly?
but it seems... in the land of the dreams, anything is indeed possible.
this area isn't for receiving guests, it's for unloading cargo! who decided to send us this way?
oh? i guess you're pretty clever. but before you open the pouch, you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
i don't like to rely on using terms like this often, but in your case it seems that it ought to be called a "previous incarnation."
my time with the spina has taught me that carrying an unreliable weapon is worse than not carrying one at all.
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations...
*sigh* how do you crash into someone in space...
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around...
you may not have the courage to challenge me, but i trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
you bet! the interastral peace broadcast recently did a whole segment about your glorious achievements!
when forced to confront such "brutal" truths, people may break down into tears, talk nonsense, or lose their tempers...
*gasp* are these echoes too?
this is the first time we've met in real life. before, we've only met in dreams, consciousness, or when i was in someone else's body.
but, which problem should we tackle first...
found you! you ran all the way out here just to play hide-and-seek? it's too dangerous!
hahaha! just a moment, please. i do hope you know how preposterous you sound at the moment.
regaining your memories means reverting completely to your previous incarnation. all the emotions that you discarded will return to you.
oooh... i wonder if it's gonna be a big one?!
vache... it's been so many years. are you still alone in the blizzard...?
he's still in a coma. i've hidden him like how one would hide a feather.
pom-pom knows how to keep people on the edge of their seats.
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
all gods don't have the same secrets, you know. she was herself, and i'm me. is it really so strange that i know nothing?
is it just me, or does the guide sound like it's enjoying itself?
hehe, guinaifen's enthusiasm is super contagious, i hope we bump into her again.
just a strange feeling. i had it a few stops ago, but it's super strong this time.
yeah! if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
thanks for introducing yourself, mister giovanni di... something something...
take all of our fungi and defeat her fair and square. force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
(hey, this is pu'er, not mister yang!)
great. well, i appreciate your company, so please don't disappear just yet.
ugh... it feels like mister giovanni has been stringing us along the whole time!
i even used the techniques that it taught me... seems like its warnings were not unfounded.
then... i ran away. i scrambled towards sumeru city looking for help.
as for your life after that, it will be up to you how you want to exist.
...but as things are right now, she's just a small bird in the sky that's about to lose its last feathers. all i can do is raise a gale to delay her fall.
huh, you must've had some miserable jobs.
hey, stay with it! this is the final push!
i did, yes. you're paying, after all.
hey, you! yes, both of you! over here! i've been keeping an eye on you for a while now.
plus, we're pretty well-equipped for a classic heroes-versus-dragon story. we got miss nilou as our magic caster, and i... i guess i'm the melee warrior who leads the charge?
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know...
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
due to the difficulty of designing an experiment and the challenges of validating theories about the past, astrological research is usually based on an immense foundation of experience.
"protector of justice"? wait, you mean... that vigilante hero from twenty years ago? the one who was always active at night?
ah sorry, i didn't mean to interrupt you... i just got a little excited. uh, please, go ahead.
i'll take his records and data with me and continue what he started. one day, the world will see a perfect blizzard immunity.
...that actually makes sense.
let's have a look over there. my gut tells me we should find something connected to vache...
i seldom had the time to drink tea. any free time i had was spent practicing martial arts.
let's take a look at what it wrote...
of course i don't. there is no need for commerce in the plane of euthymia. if i ever need something, i can simply have one of the commissions bring it to me.
that's right, be confident in your work. that's exactly how a light novelist should be.
hear, hear! ooh, how about we play through the night!
come on, let's go. just think of it as... keeping me company for a while!
you keep asking the champions of each venue to give us cryptic hints, don't you? what's that all about?
hmm? have you finished exploring the festival?
hmm... but anyway, apep disappeared and has been gone ever since that time. it's been enduring unimaginable pain all the while... it's probably in pain as we speak...
it's times like these that a leader must stand up and do what's needed...
hey, when have i ever treated you poorly?
oh? what a rich aroma and delicate texture... i didn't expect you to be such an accomplished cook... with refined taste, as well!
*sigh* ...yeah, that's exactly it. seems you know just as well as i do.
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
huh... you're right, though. i should make an effort to get out more.
during my absence, i place everything in miko's hands.
please wait a moment. i want to check something.
*sigh* fine, you're right... in that case, we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
everything he's done, not to mention the danger he poses, are beyond ordinary comprehension and completely unforgivable!
of course! don't worry, we're here on official business. you can trust us.
but that doesn't make any sense. before she was their mediator, my mother was also her own person and a member of the spina. she should have the right to take any side she wished.
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
my father could have exposed it for all to see, but he chose to take it to the grave.
hey, it wasn't like i wanted to play! the kids forced us to...
...easy now, seele. anger isn't good for one's health.
hmm? what's wrong? just adjust the focal length a bit.
suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
alright, check out this move!
right answer. now's our chance to get through to her. you, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
(y'know, just a little dramatic effect...)
umm, this is getting a little complicated... is there a... simpler explanation?
...actions rooted in persistence sometimes bear bitter fruit. sometimes, you have to let parts of yourself go, or you'll never be happy.
looking at its operational status, we must prepare for the worst. the god they wanted to create... is likely close to completion, or already completed.
yup, got it. say no more. sure thing.
why would i be worried about that? we've faced much bigger problems than this before, and we always pull through. this should be a piece of cake!
it's unnecessary, as far as i'm concerned. but since you are inviting me... a change of pace might well be nice.
still nothing new from the forest. seems like we won't be able to find your other family members for now.
let's stay alert and make sure those monsters don't spot us.
the akasha is the legacy of greater lord rukkhadevata. as lesser lord kusanali and the first akasha terminal, my consciousness has always been linked to the akasha.
so much for cutting calories...
no need for fright, and do not take what i said before too seriously. go now, to your duties. the trial i await... it will come one day.
because this is the raiden shogun's eternity.
although it's my first time working with the akasha like this, its internal structure and operation procedures are easy for me to understand. greater lord rukkhadevata's design is truly brilliant.
i've located where the false god is. time is of the essence, so let's skip to it.
hey? aren't we supposed to kick off a short story and have a fight here just like we did in the previous acts? why aren't any of these puppets saying anything?
since we're out for a walk, we shouldn't stress too much about the destination.
let's see... "have you found it? the unremarkable place downstream?"
when the childrens' parents are away in the mines, the clinic becomes a kind of nursery... haha, to be fair, it's me who invites them. perhaps i need them more than they need me.
the thing is, i'm terrible under pressure, that's just my nature. even the thought of everyone's expectations back home is enough to make me feel nervous...
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
never mind. i'll be honest with you then, i desire to spar with you.
yes. she went to khaenri'ah alone, without telling me.
miss tingyun must have left us these clues, right?
probably because the other contestants are coming up with their own ways to catch butterflies... alright, i'll do my best, too. huh?
so you never noticed how we changed, or how we grew as individuals.
*shivering* gosh... the temperature keeps getting lower... but we can't give up halfway.
they found out about his betrayal?
the flower vase and the thud we heard during the performance could indicate some altercation between halsey and the criminal in the tunnel.
me? i'm spina di rosula's guardian angel... if you've got a problem, i've got the firepower.
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
you can't change them? what does that mean...?
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
why hello... if it isn't the triumphant traveler. and why might you be visiting the shrine? a sign of piety, perhaps?
hehe, it's fine. forbidden knowledge doesn't exist anymore.
i asked some old acquaintances in town to make adele's uniform, so we should be able to pick it up right away.
so that was just a hallucination? huh, why do i feel kinda disappointed...
that's true, but this... really doesn't seem fresh...
when i'm in danger, i instinctively create ice to protect myself.
so... could the author not simply add a narrative device whereby the main character could accept the feelings of all seven admirers at once? yes, that would solve it!
hehe, well, at least i was smart enough to figure that out...
i'm not going to sign it, obviously. oh, and don't forget about our agreement.
she's suppressing a lot of guilt, but before she realized it, she had already become the sages' accomplice. she can't deny her part in their schemes anymore.
i may have misjudged this game's complexity.
hah! hahahaha...
"seems like you haven't forgotten about your very first failure."
let's go, my mom will be there soon. best not to leave old folks waiting!
so... is this a dead end?
the sighing spirit of the laboratory... ever heard of it?
look, it's wilder! he should be able to get us registered for the competition.
sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. but try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
yeah... yeah. it's finally over. it's all thanks to you guys, and my partner.
it is because they're afraid to wake up from the dream.
the tvs are so bright, it's hurting my eyes... careful, something's up...
(what's going on? is she really planning to... that's not what we thought she would...)
haha, it was nothing. a small task for the spina di rosula. silver, melus, it's time to go.
ooh, she marched off quickly. so cold.
hey, lay off, alright! my bluff is hanging from a thread here.
didn't you say you were here to negotiate with me? somehow it's starting to seem like you intend to take it by force now.
let's go. braving the unknown... that's the real spirit of trailblazing!
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
if it were me, i'd just leave him be for a couple of days. he'll recover on his own soon enough.
i know my brother he's -- meticulous when it comes to medical experiments. there's no way he wouldn't document his results.
i've seen a lot and it's made me think a lot... i really can't praise it highly enough. i hope i will remember it for a long time to come.
alright, time to go. let's get through here and meet him in person.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
there we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
besides, i doubt furina understands any more about what happened than we do.
is that where the monsters are? outside the forest, in the area with the difficult terrain?
what prophecy...? oh, wait. i know -- i think. i don't know why, but it's... in my head somehow...
but what about the rest...?
the will i carry within me will never be eroded nor destroyed.
here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
so... i can defeat him just like that?
but could you try to spice it up a bit? tell it as if it were a best-seller from yae publishing house.
it's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that i'm used to.
oh, uh...
why don't we keep up the momentum from our respective first-round victories? let's give our fungi some special training to strengthen our bonds with them.
and obviously i played my part, too.
if you're interested, you can go to the beach and give it a try.
a meticulously choreographed "chance meeting..." sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
maybe the stars above decided to help out after seeing all the effort i put into my research... haha, if that's even possible...
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
the harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. the family takes them in, but they... don't belong here.
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved..."
but by staying silent, we retained the ability to deter our opponents, and continue the stalemate.
yeah, but those are just stories and anecdotes after all. it's hard for me to piece together a more complete or intimate picture of her.
seriously, trying to save face in front of kids? *sigh*
you found him! will he know what to do about this elevator?
huh!? would miss topaz stoop so low? i can't believe she'd be that desperate...
i was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. it seems she was quite frightened, too.
a play... hmm...
*sigh* of course, the most comfortable choice is to stop progressing, give up thinking, and just keep repeating whatever you're already familiar with.
wow, you really do have that never-say-die spirit. i'm impressed.
many devoted scholars go mad as soon as they connect their consciousness... i've warned the akademiya about this many times, but people still keep falling victim to it.
"...can't go back... there are countless spaces here. our sabzeruz festival in sumeru city is just one of them..."
i hesitate to call it a solution, but i might have some information that might help.
huh? why the adventurers' guild?
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
compensation? they hit us!
is this... the lower level of the commercial district?
hey, do you think this could be related to the seals?
first, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
sounds like you went through a lot of danger... are you hurt, miss serval? i can have a look if you like.
i never expected pom-pom would be so distraught...
mm, may the world never forget this beautiful flavor. thank you.
well, here's the thing. even if skott apologizes, do you think he'd actually feel sorry for what he did?
when i got back to the arena, i saw miss yae's opponent running away like they'd just seen a ghost... miss yae said she needed to find you and discuss something, so i came with her.
yeah, he's gone... wait a sec, who're you!?
if we don't stop the god creation plan in time, we'll be in for a tough fight.
you can see the common traits of the erroneous samples on page three... ah, excuse me, i mean from the starlogs in the appendix.
at the time i was in such a hurry that i didn't hear the whole mystery. i tentatively speculated that the murderer had killed the victim the night before, but hadn't locked the door from the inside.
they may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. i need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
yes, and we should get ready for whatever we may encounter.
don't worry! if you eat like dan heng, you'll be as tall as him one day! *stifled laughter*
seems a little out of the blue, but since you came all this way, it must be urgent. go ahead.
...never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
i've been waiting for you for ages.
where is mister shamari right now? i'd like to meet him.
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
please stop... the more you talk about it, the more silly i feel...
i was perfectly calm until she volunteered to help...
but it turned out you had come to rescue me... you came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
look out! enemies incoming!
...sit up and take notice, right?
i'm surprised, too.
stay? but herta...
i'm sorry, but i should tell you that your dream did not create us. we are real people with our own consciousness.
but the appearance of your wife seems unusually stable and unaffected by any outside interference. statistically, this should be extremely rare.
let's sit down somewhere, so i can tell you everything that has happened while you were gone. fair warning, there was... a lot.
sorry, but i don't really have time to chat right now.
that hand of his! it's gonna explode!
the water that flooded the area contained primordial seawater, so the lower levels of poisson are still hazardous. to ensure everyone's safety, i've asked the people there to leave as soon as possible.
this lady... is really something else!
...it's like it's been erased? who's done this...
...stellaron hunter: sam.
i didn't expect the first lesson to be so intense...
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
hehe, i enjoyed them too! oh, do you remember that one time we went exploring around the spina together? we overheard papa call your master fontaine's "protector of justice."
still... there is one other thing on this topic that i suspect you may be curious to know.
the akasha relies on the power of a gnosis to operate, as it is the manifestation of the god of wisdom's power. it compiles the wisdom of the entire populace, and it grants knowledge to the people.
in some of my tournament matches, i could see my opponent's hands shaking, hesitant to play their cards. now that i think about it, perhaps they were scared of what would happen if they defeated me...
wait... i wrote that! that's a story i made up about my past!
people join wildfire for themselves, for the newborn next door without a mother, for the elderly with no home to return to.
avoid entering someone's past memories lightly, especially hers.
...no! i can't accept this!
huh? you want to help me?
why do people choose to sleep? i think...
she says what she thinks -- i like her. and did you hear what she said about the silvermane guards? haha, sounded like she'd been waiting a long time to say it. i think i'd get along with her.
huh, you do seem to travel light. but... don't you at least need some pajamas!?
that... doesn't even sound human.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
furina sure was quick to point the finger at lyney without any decisive evidence whatsoever, wasn't she?
so what does he want us to take a look at?
that statue... it wasn't here last time.
vache... if you had the chance to stand here and watch jarilo-vi from afar...
you say that... but do i see your ears saying otherwise?
i'm sorry. i hadn't considered that kind of possibility...
so i am afraid i can't help you.
these conclusions are all correct in their own way, but none of them objectively describe the shroomboar.
what's that? you want to open it now?
my concept of "self" has become so clear...
give me a moment. i'll contact them right now.
as an individual, you don't have any sense of belonging... and you seem to have even fewer convictions than a typical scholar.
h--hello, are you azzam?
that doesn't sound right... i need to think about this some more.
as you wish. it's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
i've been staring at books and my thesis every day... i've forgotten how nice and happy life actually can be.
after all, that giant dendro dragon is also your family. maybe it would listen.
mm... don't give me that look. it's just a game after all, and having fun should be your main concern.
some things we heard were pretty straightforward, but others were just ridiculous...
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
it's all good. we've had you for practice.
you're heading back to the store, right? let's walk and talk. i'll tell you all about it on the way.
(hah, it's quite amusing to watch how all of this is playing out. a little nudge in the right direction and things will become much more dramatic...)
heheh, you're quite concerned about that young lady. that's fair -- she was hell-bent on assuring your safety even at the brink of death... started to tug a little at my heartstrings, even.
clara, you're observant, right? take a look at us. do we look like underworlders?
i'll find a way to dispose of vache's leftover reagents. next time the "mutual aid society" wants to whip up a quack cure? they'll be out of luck.
if you drink sinthe for an extended amount of time, you'll suffer many side effects, such as losing the ability to focus or control your emotions.
they're concerned that we might be colluding with outside parties, or that we might find outside help to disrupt the case...
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
hearing urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. in return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
and that's it, that is all that's happened so far.
in any case, i probably can't take over their minds directly.
however, convincing their most chronically lazy member to help us is well within my abilities.
hoo-wee! we may be new to the xianzhou, but we're already investigating the mysterious disappearance of luocha...
rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. thunder is required.
huh? are we starting now!?
that... that's not something i will accept.
...but deep down, it feels kinda good. is this what slipping into the dark side feels like?
although he doesn't seem very... friendly, merchants are usually a good source of information, right?
she's my source of knowledge. i'm merely the representation of how she would be if she were rested and healthy.
well, you see, just recently we were attacked by a horde of unnumbered gardemeks in the city.
but then again, i know you'd be able to see right through those words... i'm feeling weak, there's no hiding it.
that kid puts up a strong front, but under the surface he's afraid of becoming a burden -- that's why he trains and fights so hard... i hope one day he's able to slow down and listen to his heart.
besides, i'm the president of spina di rosula. i've got to keep my chin up.
it's a pretty solid story overall. i thought it was just an ordinary adventure at first, but the further we got into it, the more impressed i became with the production and the plot.
we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
what about all the unresolved emotions of the parties involved? what happens to them?
after some system hours, the words will turn into a common language that everyone can understand.
keep it safe? is that all you intend to do with it?
if you mess this up, it'll reflect poorly on me, too!
very good! the wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
but be that as it may, i believe that a lot of them genuinely do expect great things from me.
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
so, eric, why did they threaten you like that. what happened?
would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at yae publishing house instead?
we're close now. it's just a little further inside.
so what about... making lots of friends, helping them solve their problems, and reading their letters from front to back? are those habits, too?
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine!
this also explains the insubstantiality of our dreams. no matter what they may become, we don't really care.
look around you. the grass grows green and lush and a soft breeze blows. this is inazuma at peace, as you will no doubt remember.
i like keeping busy, otherwise i start obsessing over... pointless things.
still, you did end up victorious. i gather congratulations are in order.
nice work indeed -- you're sidekick to a genius detective after all!
you saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. after leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
k--keep watch? are we space cowboys now? i guess this is the cosmic wild west.
but is this nation worth existing for eternity?
if only he was that easygoing when it came to talking business...
i can't remember the last time i went swimming. i might not even know how to anymore...
conductor, can i get a juice, please? thank youuuu~
yes, but time's of the essence, so i have to take what i can get... sorry, i'm just making excuses...
here! there are still survivors here...
but it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the inazuma of today is no longer inazuma.
i'm gonna go write down my question. hopefully the seelie replies...
here it is, just as i thought. the seelie must have placed it here in advance.
no, no, this is completely different.
he must be a fan of this book too... i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
honestly, i don't think clorinde would make things too difficult for us no matter what the fateometer says... isn't that right, clorinde?
time marches forward, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in the history of trailblazing expeditions.
haha! well, i don't think it's carved in stone anywhere that fancy ladies can only read books, sip tea, ride horses, and play the piano. i just really enjoy making snacks.
a magnificent, dramatic, and wondrous trial, a trial to end all things... ah, how could you hope to understand...
where's our next stop? i can't wait!
...you're really into clockie, huh? he's just a fictional character, not a real person!
huh!? wait, this is it!
you're willing to tell me all your secrets because you have nothing to fear.
they were helping evacuate the residents... but they couldn't leave in time...
i'm just curious is all. i have a feeling you'll say something amazing.
doctor natasha said that she's a handful, but that she also takes care of the homeless kids. maybe she's more mature than she seems?
drifting memory fragments...
...do you think anyone's gonna know what you're talking about?
and now here i am, investigating his death. you really are a handful, aren't you, papa?
i just got a minor fracture, so i had to rest at bimarstan for a while.
we're not that old ourselves, right? and yet here we are -- express passengers on trailblazing expeditions!
but... doesn't that mean everyone will die? i'm a fontainian just like them -- will i dissolve too?
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
gah! hook, say something -- you're freaking me out!
i don't know everything that you're going through, but how about replacing your hammer?
hey, check it out. the bases of these stone lanterns are different...
nah, i'd like to live a little longer.
after all, every person in sumeru city is one of their hostages.
you must be wondering how someone can be so clumsy...
so. from what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
let's go for one more round in the administrative district! i wanna take more photos!
...oh, right.
someone with a vision should technically be really powerful, right? handling a group of treasure hoarders should be well within my abilities.
most of the tourists around at the moment are here to attend the wardance, and that's why we're here too.
she's right here. this is ilman's child, haydar.
i suppose the significance would be the journey itself and the world we helped create. there's still value in the time i shared with everyone here, in the things we were able to accomplish, even if no one remembers them.
we just so happened to arrive during this... invasion. of course, as a -- ahem -- crew of heroes, we're happy to lend a hand.
it's my honor to meet you, general huaiyan...
during the hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the grand narukami shrine. having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
that's good to hear. otherwise, given that i am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
serval, you seem to know more about aether spirits than us -- can you tell us what's up with this little guy?
let's call it a day. thank you for cleaning up the mess my brother left behind. here -- for your trouble.
i would like to observe the number of guards stationed in the hall.
he's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
huh, what's that? a fungus with a long beard? there's no such thing... though if there were, i'd love to give it a pat or two.
he will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. remember, this is the price you pay.
quick! don't let her escape!
huh? where'd the sound go!?
i don't know if the family only lost their belongings in the end, or if something worse happened to them.
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here... mind if we ask you a few questions?
wait, i think i get what it means by the "child" and "awe and fear"...
giant trees will completely block out the sun... plants and humans will fight over oxygen... sumeru will no longer be suitable for sustaining life!
however, why are there still so many people striving to move forward even when they know the path ahead is dangerous and painful?
that's bronya! h--huh? is that cocolia too!?
hope the seelie's clue wasn't also torn to shreds by avidya leopards...
actually, i've sensed a familiar feeling ever since i arrived here. it's brought some old memories to mind.
we have to issue an evacuation order to the townspeople, and get them as far away from the entrance as possible. that should save them from the worst of it...
that's impossible. it was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
tonight i'm going to focus again on clearing my mind... no schoolwork, no assignments, nothing! keeping it completely blank...
*sigh* am i to take it that the safety of the people of inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
thank you so much. i've made up my mind not to use astrology for this. i think i'll just try my luck in the city.
they seem to be pretty ancient, alright.
ooh, true, very true. in that case... boss, we'll have another two dishes!
however, in spite of the bad situation, i still managed to make a fair deal with the doctor.
"self-reflection is a wonderful quality to possess, but you'll only end up hurting yourself if you overdo it."
"those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
really? i was just explaining what it is i'm trying to do.
hmm... let me think, what kind of character should i play this time?
well, go on, time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. i'm counting on you.
well, never mind. what about one of you, then? anyone who can defeat me, takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new tenryou commissioner.
sorry, sorry, i shouldn't have brought that up. i wasn't planning to talk about sad things tonight.
sheesh... the logic in this plot and dialogue is really being pushed to its limits...
squealing isn't enough! you also need to apologize to the owner of the sleepless earl, and take back what you said about xianzhou swordplay!
one of them is yanqing, the boy we've all met before. the other is yunli, the granddaughter of general huaiyan from the xianzhou zhuming.
that's possible. you see soulglad everywhere these days, so it wouldn't be a surprise if someone brought a bottle here.
oh, and there'll be a cameo for mister kamisato and miss yoimiya as well. they'll be used to show outsider perspectives on the fates of the two musketeers.
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
and yet, to think that someone was able to use this magic trick to commit a crime.
hey, don't rush her! so sorry, miss jingyan, they can be a little impatient. take your time, we can wait.
no need, why don't you just take us to the city? we don't really know the way.
*yawn* ... that's enough sightseeing and photo-taking to last me a while...
i don't know. before i could figure out what was going on, it spat me out...
it's rare to hear such comforting words from you. i graciously accept them.
it's just like last time. after my father took his place in the duelists' ring, i pushed through the guards to talk to you as a last resort...
perhaps you thought i'd planned an intensive training session for you? heh, that won't be necessary. on the contrary, when you're constantly on edge, you miss quite a lot of important things.
sure enough... the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
the kitchen knife and spices supreme... i think i heard about that store before -- over in exalting sanctum.
and is that... lady furina in the third image? did the hydro archon fall into the water?
well then that's as good as nothing for now... so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one...
patrolling the streets is the tenryou commission's job. the shogun has a lot of information to process and orders to give out. she doesn't have time to deal with it herself.
well... doctor jiaoqiu? are we really doing this? shouldn't we defeat him in a more honorable way...? maybe we should just completely forget about this idea.
i see... perhaps if we were able to find miss topaz, she'd be able to give us some clues.
yeah, exactly... uhm, are you being sarcastic?
ahh, watch out! behind you!
forbidden knowledge? hmm, it seems you know about a concept that even i don't completely understand. could you tell me what you know?
during the course of finding memories, a picture is worth a thousand words.
i'll also ask someone to write florent a letter and inform him of everything that happened here today, so he can increase security around poisson, and be on guard against any suspicious individuals.
right on! i'm stealing that!
so, ask yourself this... who was it that deprived him of that right to exist?
what did we plan to do after this...? i kinda forgot.
why don't you skip all this rigmarole and just have a heart-to-heart conversation with me? it might tickle a little.
the storage room... it's behind the shelves, right?
a train? could it be...
of course, if there is a day when the underworld doesn't need a doctor like me anymore and everyone lives happily ever after...
don't worry. such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, so once you leave my sight, you'll be able to remember everything again. and also...
before we learn the truth, please don't try to recreate the scenes in your dreams. whatever you see, don't be tempted by them.
...she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
i wasn't scared by anything... but on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
...but given the present circumstances, i'm afraid i must regretfully decline your casting request.
yes, i paid her a visit right after i woke up. she was resting at the time.
well then. the door is open. hop on in.
i do believe he was prepared for that outcome. i could see it in his eyes.
the doctor was set on developing a medicine that would steel the human body against the cold. he named his research project "blizzard immunity."
i never thought that i'd have the chance to stand next to my mother... not even in my wildest dreams.
if even you can't find anything, that seems to confirm it: irminsul does not keep records on the descenders. anyone who comes from beyond this world is not counted as part of teyvat.
but strangely, he not only requested the duel himself, but rumor has it...
oho, did i just hear someone taking a dig at fleuve cendre? i'll tell my guys to stuff your pillows full of actual seaweed right now!
it's all happened so quickly i can only make conjecture. after leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. i hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
after recent events, the akasha can no longer function as it used to.
her body may have perished, but she became the sacred sakura. this, too, is a form of eternity.
i see... fine, i respect your choice. let's return to reality.
miss topaz, bronya's already told us about belobog's debt situation...
yeah, it's his problem, not yours.
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
i heard mister yang was once the leader of a secret organization and saved a whole planet! not to mention he's been a teacher, and even a storyboard artist! *sigh* he must be an alien or something...
i have a responsibility to protect the well-being of my patients... or to put it another way: i must eradicate any and all threats to them.
are you trying to start another fight...
then where did it go? and why is it so quiet all of a sudden?
is today the day of your creation? return to the city with me. i will read out a speech for you in front of all my attendants. "embarrassing"? ...understood.
what a childish conversation this is.
this is your hard-earned money. looking after a bookshop is no easy task.
but the people of poisson... they've already...
correct. although it possessed shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. as a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train shingo to become bolder.
please... you've got to believe me...
hahaha. come on, in we go.
the stellaron hunters have interacted with the ipc, but not the ten stonehearts... our paths have never crossed. as for your offer, i can pass it along to my partners, but i have a question...
mister giovanni is right, we got all the victory zone mastery marks... all we need to do now is wait for the final showdown!
at that time, i could sense ei's whereabouts, but i also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
ugh... let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
but let me ask you this: how do you plan to solve the issues we are currently facing?
huh... it's just, there are less painkillers than i'd expected. did someone break into the storage room?
the place we're going is called the palais mermonia. the office of the chief justice is on the fourth floor.
oh, this is the short sword clorinde mentioned last night. i found it!
right! i'd totally forgotten -- that's the whole reason we came here in the first place!
it's a shame, though, that this pawnshop can't give me what i desire. my last attempt in penacony... well, it ends with "hope."
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
forget it now, please forget that i ever said anything! ah, wait, but it'd also be bad if you were to forget it...
wow, what a beautiful lobby! it's gonna be soft mattresses and cushiony pillows tonight!
if this space is exclusive to debbi's dream, then the others beside her are most likely the people she cherishes.
i was wondering the same thing. why would they pick on someone half their size?
but i'm very concerned about your homeland. this is something i should help with, it's really no trouble to me at all.
*sigh* alright, i guess the cat's out of the bag. of all the times to wake up...
she's also in the running for the legacy... how is she going to sneak into the dreamscape unnoticed?
did kafka escape? argh, how are we gonna explain this to the master diviner!?
then why didn't mister callas explain himself in court? if he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya...
the important thing is not the format but the creative work itself. it is impossible to come up with anything fresh if you're stuck using some rigid format of the past.
thanks to the knave, spina di rosula received generous support from the fatui, which allowed us to complete the rescue and evacuation work so quickly.
i was dying of curiosity the entire time! i mean, you did a pretty bang-up job of pretending nothing had gone wrong. furina actually looked like she thought all of it was planned...
guess what! something weird just happened when i was on my way over here. someone gave me a strange gift.
thank you for your assistance, miss alley. by the way... is miss robin doing fine? we are looking forward to her performance.
that's why fate is the ultimate knowledge, isn't it?
clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
oh? my, you've been busier than i thought.
...time waits for no one! let me show you around!
mom... i have so much to say to you, but there's an urgent matter that needs your help.
come, this way -- it's a short walk. don't get lost.
aww, i thought that one would be the hardest question. that's why i put it last.
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
seems like the first day of our trailblazing expeditions is always pretty eventful, huh dan heng.
that's no ordinary kid. so young and yet so... stubborn? no, intelligent?
don't worry, you don't have to do any actual fishing if you're too tired.
we have two possible leads right now. the first is the checkout logs of those two books, and the other is the red stamp.
we'll be arriving at our destination soon. how are you feeling? are your minds still intact?
but eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, ei.
our battle... their battle... it's just beginning.
with you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous... *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
all right, everyone. let's make a decision.
as if you've ever described a situation as being "out of control." i'm pretty sure any situation you consider to be easy to handle would scare a reasonable person half to death!
there's a crowd over there. looks like something really did happen...
did the prophecy say where that family member went?
...how imaginative...
*sniff* what's that weird smell...
she even factored my immaturity into her plan.
they say that alchemical divination is the dendro archon's divine revelation. so then, if nahida has referred to herself as the moon...
huh... do you think svarog and clara felt the effects of our battle with the guardian?
huh? something wrong, clorinde?
later on, she probably got sick of answering those questions and decided to stick to just two -- the "protector of justice" and the "protector of order."
i'm the complete march seventh... with all of your forgotten memories.
i'm done with the parts that needed my involvement to complete.
(b--because, uhh... well, we're too law-abiding to understand bad guy logic.)
good idea! we might be able to get some leads on the monsters and bad guys we're after!
today's training ends here. the qualifiers should be over now. we should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
i see. so compared to a distant and uncertain future, what you really care about is making sure the people around you have a good life...
haha, then it's settled! let's go hunt some monsters!
(it seems to be anxious and afraid.)
oh, you mean that they got the incantation from that book. yes, i know the one.
be on your guard, everyone. the monsters might still be around...
i don't know what you're talking about -- but you know acheron, the galaxy ranger, yes? i have something to ask you.
okay, okay, that's enough of that. let's go and find julian.
shh... listen to what the people around us are talking about. the conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
i've always respected my people's free will, so i've never actually occupied their consciousness. when necessary, i just borrow this bionic snezhnayan puppet.
i don't need your apology, your guilt, or your support from the shadows. you don't have to do anything for my sake.
human beings really are conflicted life forms...
and if my charges prove true, then tartaglia here will be proven innocent by default, correct?
you are right that it is a bit strange, though. if you've already committed to build three lines, why not just add a fourth?
that's right. this is how indemnitium is produced.
okay. is everyone ready? i--i'm gonna do it.
their appearance is highly random. some have tried coming up with ways to predict their occurrence, but the results are less than reliable.
now, time for a change of pace. where should we go?
haha, so you've caught news of that already?
you're not dead yet. how can you give up that easily!?
are you sure that's alright?
yes, i am. this is probably the first time i'm faced with a calamity of this degree since my birth.
yeah, we haven't gotten to the end yet.
...let's leave it for now. i'll feel a lot better once i've gotten rid of this mess that vache left us.
i've managed to secure more than a few urgent medical supplies through him, and he's been a big help to wildfire... in any case, i don't think his intentions are sinister.
i have high hopes for this journey!
i'm fine, seriously. really! i...
i... might've exaggerated your condition for sampo's ears... but that guy owes me. he better bring me back some medicine.
uh... kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
i got here a little late, but i watched your duel with luka -- it was amazing!
what are you so afraid of, honestly? we're finally about to meet the true author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." aren't you excited?
uh... can't we get bronya to cover the bill?
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
...okay, so, can i ask now?
normally you'd want a heater inside a building, right?
urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
huh? no, wh--what is that?
great minds really do think alike!
the tea society is just a code name, did you think they'd call themselves the evil society? they have to have a nice-sounding name to conceal themselves!
ah, right. yes, i remember now.
this is amazing! i'm so jealous, you're good at everything.
if people of the past deserved the gods' attention, then so do the people of the future.
yes, but i don't think i was of much help to you all...
your mind will begin to build the dream far more attentively, which in turn will make it feel more real.
thank you for your concern, dear. but, believe me, i am quite comfortable wherever i go.
oh, and don't forget to return the pass permit to me after you have finished with it.
who... are you? whose voice is that? it sounds familiar...
the result being that in the centuries since their sacrifice, i have dishonored their will.
...furuyama? is that you?
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
nah, i don't think so. i don't like you.
(i can sense its excitement from seeing its fellow fungus wake back up.)
good morning! is work going well today, master diviner?
hmm, good point. why else would it use such a roundabout way to tell me its answer?
thanks for the information. we're planning to head deeper into the snow plains to find my brother.
so that one day, the people of poisson will enjoy the boons it brings as well.
no... that doesn't seem right... i need to think about this some more.
so you suggest accepting aventurine's proposal to team up?
but from now on, i want to spend my time learning real stories about real people, and how they touch the lives of others around them.
when ayato approached me about holding the test of courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help chizuru face her problem.
how many reports do i still have left to write...? four... oh, no, five...
so, how was last night? did you get a good night's sleep?
all those losses were meaningless, driven by the demands of the "laws." there's no point in bringing it up again.
(what does she mean, "onto something"? i certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
so, in argenti's eyes, wubbaboos are a thing of beauty...
but in this supposed "bliss", people won't have defeated their demons. the chance to overcome their tribulations would be forever lost to them. in other words... it is an escape.
in fact, aside from our inability to physically interact with each other, there's something else you should know about this space. with caribert gone, we won't be able to remember anything that happened here...
as for the truth... that's on you to find out. if you were told the truth instead of discovering it yourselves... it would literally blow your minds. i don't know how you'd be after that.
and there you have it, that's the truth behind what happened...
such a long tunnel. didn't feel this long when i set off.
...sorry, don't mean to sound cynical. maybe it simply represents the people's hopes up here.
we still don't have enough evidence to work off of, so it's hard to draw any reliable conclusions yet... but i'm concerned that ilman's case may not be unique to him...
don't be afraid. the one who has come to greet us... has arrived.
on stage, the lead role is the focal point of the audience's attention, and you're all used to seeing the director as the heart of the troupe.
hehe, thank you for the kind words, but i honestly don't need physical freedom as long as i can connect my consciousness to the akasha.
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
back then, i didn't even dare to dream about having someone to confide in.
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
you have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
because we need geomarrow. after belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. the eternal freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
hehe... regardless, please do look after me while i'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
hey hey, go me!
since the goal here is to bond with our fungi, we should treat them as friends and create happy memories with them. eating and having fun together are vital components of "friendship training."
s--sorry... i'm just a little panicky...
oh, yeah! fyxestroll garden! it's famous for supernatural stuff, with those mischievous heliobi floating around! it's pretty fascinating!
do you remember us walking through the snow plains?
as long as the terms are reasonable, i don't think there's a problem in making a deal. even with the balladeer.
why, i wouldn't miss it for the world -- seeing as you put so much work into everything.
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
anyway, i really didn't expect to meet you here.
in any case... why did you come to poisson?
also, it's much more spacious here than a birdcage.
i thought that the story between you and the fungi would follow a master-servant paradigm, but you offered something even better: companionship, based on mutual understanding.
it looks so much like dan heng... i wonder if...
my, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
anyway, are you scared, little friend? don't you worry, now, it'll be over soon. just think of it like having a dream.
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them... but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
ugh... the syrup has turned clumpy... i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
there are many homeless people in the underworld. if they had safety and security, they wouldn't have to struggle to survive.
let's see what we have this time... whatever it is, i'm ready.
jeez, you sound just like those parents on the xianzhou! can't i get some praise now?
...see, i told you it wasn't going to be that simple. where is this?
anyway, we both know why i'm here. tell me, how can the spina be of service to you?
oh, okay... you do your best, too.
oh, you haven't heard? "lesser lord kusanali" is the deity in whom the people of sumeru place their faith. it's their chosen term of endearment for her.
i couldn't even save her. if i were a competent archon, i wouldn't have let my most faithful follower die at the sabzeruz festival with so many regrets...
uh -- what about your mom?
even though it will cause your present self great mental anguish?
is the starskiff haven always this crowded? there are so many people here! i can barely hear anything!
oh? it's been a while. did pom-pom call you back?
traveling to other worlds is all that anyone seems be writing about these days. huh, goodness knows what they find so disappointing about their own world.
huh...? huh!? so, you're the real chief? wh--what about oleg?
well whatever, we won... thanks to that giant robot, we were finally able to take care of the stellaron... and bronya made a promise -- the underworld and the overworld will soon be reunited.
it's soulglad! but i thought they didn't sell soulglad at the bar?
all right. drift peacefully off to sleep, and i'll be right with you.
it was still being set up when i was there earlier, but i assume it should be ready soon.
hmm, let me see... which sword is the most powerful? single sword? greatsword? or maybe a flying sword?
...alright, alright, i'm coming. no need to drag me!
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
casual... how about this? this feels quite natural.
if not for the vigilance of my partner, i probably wouldn't even be here talking to you right now.
hmm? agreement?
you need to use it to pray to the goddess... i'll explain later -- first, let's help these guys!
if the dendro dragon fails to hang on, the elemental power inside it will no longer be able to maintain its form, and will all be dispersed.
this shrine looks somewhat familiar.
it sounds like... the three of us and seele might not be enough. why don't we go back underground and get wildfire to come with us?
i've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near fountain plaza. don't worry, i know my way around the administrative district.
if there's one thing i can't stand, it's a false accusation. no one's gonna orchestrate some conspiracy to take down one of my friends and get away with it.
it said it knew about my past... and then it stopped talking.
trying my luck with another phenomenon is better than doing nothing.
but that's not all... there's a large void within its elemental power.
the philosophy of life that he shared with us just now, that was makoto's view on reality. she always saw things that way.
makoto never saw me as a fearless weapon. likewise, i should not regard you as a mere tool.
in focusing single-mindedly on confronting the heavenly principles, we neglected our original mission: the revival of the homeland.
...wait, three? there is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? wait... it's...
oh!? you mean... you'll help us investigate?
perhaps... i might have a shot at beating both masters in the ring?
we're looking for a stellaron -- it's the source of all the disasters here. if we find it, we can--
then we could still have a fight on our hands.
these words have been appearing and then vanishing persistently for awhile now. whose thoughts are they? and who is this mikhail...
if i can't learn swordplay well, i'll have no one to blame but myself.
it's up to you... do you wanna try something different?
(the sound we heard may have come from a clash between the missing halsey and the criminal.)
by neither saying goodbye nor seeing me again, our relationship will remain forever how it was... in her mind, at least.
you really zeroed in on the issue and put it right in front of her. it might feel a bit overwhelming for setaria...
in any case, since you remember what happened just now... well, that's put my mind at ease.
thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
let me guess -- time, space... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
let's see... this should be the place. nothing seems out of the ordinary...
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley...
follow me. i'll explain it once we find that elemental life-form.
see? my takes on fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
only through elucidating what really happened in that case can we connect all the dots for the serial disappearances case.
ahh... oh no. i'm losing it... so dizzy... ugh...
dreams are fantastical, complex, and full of imagination. people's brains are the most active when they're dreaming.
speak quickly, unless you want to earn yourself a one-way ticket to coupon-town.
it's nice to walk from time to time, isn't it? think of it as something like a hiking trip.
...entertainment for grownups?
you've been standing here for half an hour. it's rare to see you like this.
i see... these are all people who i communicate with quite regularly.
hold on. i think i got something.
we were just talking to her in the museum... do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
has anyone finished this round yet?
what are you waiting for!? hurry up or they'll start getting suspicious!
many people's images are flashing before my eyes. i'm sure some are coming to those of you in the audience as well...
(oh no... judging by the atmosphere, clorinde and navia are probably thinking something similar. the mood just got super awkward all of a sudden...)
don't let your emotions get the better of you. if i were in his shoes, i might well have had the same reaction. now i need to focus on treating the patients, and dispelling their doubts.
the snow is sparkling. just like the stars in the night sky.
take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
if we were looking down from on high, i wonder whether we'd find that the ley lines are just the reflections of the stars upon the earth?
but wouldn't that mean i'm just pushing it all on you? what if she just gets angry at you instead?
it would seem that there has been a misunderstanding. to be clear, the raising of both hands is not always an indication of surrender...
i have my ways. i would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
no, it wasn't that bad. it really depended on how lucky you were. grilled apples and sunsettias are actually quite delicious.
if you want me to appoint a new clan, then naturally, there must first be a new duel.
that we will! i'm looking forward to hearing about your future adventures, so make sure to stop by and tell us about them sometime!
but as this war continues to rage, and as i continue to seek that final answer...
but seeing as you're a hero who's been all over teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
i'm okay, my mind just decided to stray elsewhere for a moment. give me a second to gather myself... oh, is this the celestial globe that i needed to borrow?
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
but where did i put it...
so, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
best future? best for who? as if you'd consider anyone but yourself.
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
...i'm going back to my dessert now. you all can keep discussing that on your own.
i don't know much about my life story... but i do have extraordinary skills!
well... this doesn't necessarily mean a thing, right? in terms of methods, both the fools and the riddlers could pull it off. hasn't the ipc cracked the message, too?
huh? really? i just wanted to say something...
hehehe... "those with keen eyes see the dust between the stars!" i came up with that, by the way.
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
still, if we're going to hunt the monsters, we need to know where to find them. can you give us any leads?
have you ever seen anyone outside of the crew interact with misha?
don't lose heart. sometimes you might feel like you're the unluckiest person in the world, but for all you know, it could also just be an unfortunate situation.
as wildfire's leader, i couldn't simply look on while you fought on our behalf. we had to come help.
thanks to their guidance, i've actually made some progress. when i get back to the express, i'll definitely show off my skills and impress you all!
the defeat was a heavy blow to her. it also didn't help that i forgot to bring her some tricolor dango and light novels when i went to see her...
i am the current president of spina di rosula. if your boss wants to talk with me, i'd be happy to meet with him.
mm-hmm! oh, we brought you a message from bronya! ahem, "the blockade will soon be lifted. the people of the underworld will breathe freely."
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
i almost feel like there's still something extremely important i need to do... but i can't remember what it is.
...though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
see these musical instruments playing themselves with no human performers? that's the sweet dreams troupe.
right now, you're in a dream i created using information extracted from your memories.
maybe around thirty... or forty percent?
ahem! s--seeing as our hosts are so thoughtful, i guess we should help ourselves. right, mister yang?
*sigh* leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of inazumans.
get revenge? wait... you're not romeuf's followers, are you?
i can't think of any connection i have with vimara village, though. i've only been there once, and it was pretty uneventful.
yes, it's right inside.
strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here...
hehe, i suppose that is what she's been calling me.
favor...? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
i can't forgive him for what he's done. but nor can i say i don't miss him...
the tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
what's with all the people gathered around? what happened?
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
we heard about miss firefly from black swan... but we never expected miss robin to...
have you noticed? these landscapes seem quite distinct from that of penacony's in your dream, yet strikingly similar to the dreamscape described by miss black swan.
oh, you bet. between that and all the other errands i have to run at the court, i'm always forgetting one thing or another.
this girl's pretty strong... hey dan heng, maybe now's a good time to show off your secret strength!?
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
you already asked that when we first got here.
hey, there's a ride attendant over there!
we can cross the polluted consciousness until we've found the right path to meet with her lucid consciousness.
no, not at all... look, i am the hydro archon of fontaine, focalors. the god of justice, who is loved and adored by many...
you're afraid... afraid to accept that the fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
and what's more... the fragmentum corrosion has begun to reach us down here, too...
ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? sure, i'll take one.
three years ago, he was accused of murdering his own friend, but he chose a duel to defend his honor instead of standing trial. he died in the duelists' ring.
and with funds from the confrerie, he could also afford a large number of gardemeks...
next up... let's interview those two over there.
huh? that's sooner than i expected. is she well enough to...
here we are. this is the place.
just like what happened with greater lord rukkhadevata, no one remembers him, because there's been a change in people's memories.
hahaha. good work, you two. then i'll get to it. please sit tight for a moment, you'll get to taste my awesome snacks soon enough!
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
but if the prophecy will come true, i'll also die anyway, right? so if i've already met you as my magical meeting in this world...
wait... do you plan on slipping skott a laxative?
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master..."
urakusai, how much time do you have left?
wait, how? none of our investigations have had anything to do with him.
hurry and go. dreams are supposed to be fantastical, romantic, and full of pleasant surprises. unnecessary things like this samsara... need to end.
i did feel a little faint when i first entered the desert, but i feel a lot better after resting here for a while.
none. no one has seen the devotee of eternity since she shut herself away. in fact, no one even knows what it looks like in there.
you have friends and family that have been affected, don't you? that have gotten stuck?
y'know, it's funny how the "rules" always seem to work in your favor, don't you think? this world's been hanging by a thread and now you're here to pull the plug on it!
luckily, i managed to finish my restorations and mind-jump away from him just as he was about to capture me.
precisely! heh... and i'm not even the hydro archon anymore, so all my power is gone anyway.
just look at caribert. he was so pure and single-minded... the space we now find ourselves is a perfect representation of who he was -- quiet and peaceful.
so... you're also saying the guards want to work with wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
i'll definitely think of a way to make it up to you once i take care of my thesis.
yeah, they mentioned miss topaz! what's that all about?
even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. amazing...
now, i need to make some preparations, following which our joint investigation shall commence... you two shall be my assistants!
as for the other descenders... i still need to verify their existence. it could take me some time.
then i should find someone who's already involved, but hasn't decided to side with the sages.
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
i see. you decided to admit to your feelings in an effort to bring me down with you...
well, let's not just stand here twiddling our thumbs. actors, to the makeup booth. we'll start on the next scene as soon as we get a working kamera.
well, you see... we are the ones that owe an explanation. if we keep putting off the meeting, it could easily result in the problem escalating, right?
well, how can you become renowned through all of teyvat without a fancy signboard of your own? the spina's way ahead of you in that regard!
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything... it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
this experience is a case in point. i feel like i've learned a lot, and it has already been well worth the price of admission.
there's just no way that svarog's calculations would have included variables like us, y'know?
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself...
the spina di rosula has prepared a special vehicle for you, so you can just get in, and we'll push it all the way out of fontaine!
well, friends, i would say we've earned ourselves a nice meal for our efforts! let's go! spina's treat!
really? you jumped just now -- it was really sudden, too.
it's all thanks to your amazing guidance, masters!
of course i want to live on, but... what fate owes me, i want it paid back, not passed on. no one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.
since it was raining that day, the culprit was confident that they could use the rain to wash away all traces of their dissolved accomplice.
hmm, well i'm not convinced that it was makoto's power alone...
alright, i've answered your question. now it's time you answer mine.
...but, the gate didn't move an inch...
phew...that was scary, it just suddenly attacked!
the child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some fried tofu.
but if we decide to abandon reality and embrace our dreams, then our dreams would become far more substantial.
...seems we have to go into a dream and find out the truth for ourselves.
in an attempt to adapt to its new environment, apep changed color from the emerald green of the forest to the yellow of the sand.
what a frightened look you have. don't worry. since this has nothing to do with you, i won't be suspecting you of anything. why don't you come take a stroll with me?
you... you would draw your blade against a god?
i picked up slivers of her thoughts in the memory zone. these will help you form an impression of her. now, you must hang on to these thoughts with all your might, and shape them in your mind.
(come to think of it, she disappeared after mentioning that she was going to meet with the genius society. i wonder how things turned out for her.)
wait a minute, so we're actually looking for wubbaboos, not passes?
what's... going on? i can't seem to remember... anything clearly. the only thing i know for sure is this prophecy... will it really come to pass?
i gave a speech to inspire my people, so if i were to fail to live up to those words myself, then that would be too embarrassing, hehe.
ahh, whatever. can you please tell me how to submit a question to the wisdom seelie?
hah -- and who do you think were the inspiration for the tea society? us, that's who.
hah! once you bite the dust, you'll know what i'm capable of!
one after another, people were taken by the water... all those treasured lives and memories, washed out of existence in an instant.
...despicable. my "criminal activity" senses are tingling.
...it's okay. thanks.
so be it. well then, you who would defy eternity... time for you to enlighten me.
nope, she seemed normal to me too. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
something i've begun to realize since my departure from the opera epiclese is that there's a lot you don't see when you observe everything from on high.
i wasn't planning on saying anything... but i saw a couple of very sad-looking faces in the crowd.
n--no! we're not on a date!
we've walked pretty far now.
not so fast! last time we were here, that evil madam guardian interrupted us before we'd gotten the most out of our luxury suites... don't you think we should make up for it?
it somehow makes me feel a little... lonely.
it said that they are looking for a way to save their homeland, but the catastrophe of the desert should've ended a long time ago.
yes, photographs often record very precious memories.
we're here. th--that's the spot.
long have i heard of your grand deeds, o fairy, who restored the lifeblood of the forest, o hero, who... huh?
it's so nice to speak with you, greater lord rukkhadevata. i've always wanted to meet you...
well, king deshret is long gone, and setaria is also too smart to fall for any simple tricks...
just share it with me. i'm what you'd call a "witness."
i understand that you have an amazing resistance to forbidden knowledge.
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
i understand why you're trying to make her the hero of the story, but... isn't she your hero already? after everything she did for you?
oh, no i... i'm actually having a lot of trouble with it...
hmm... well, let's say a rishboland tiger ate a fox and got diarrhea.
am i... really not needed?
didn't she tell you? in private, she insisted on accompanying you.
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously... well, at least we finally get to go through...
last time you entered the plane of euthymia, it was in front of the statue of the omnipresent god, correct?
i think i'm following now. so what you're saying is, even though we decided to put on this trial to avoid fulfilling the prophecy...
there's a few things that seem a little off about this place. lemme collect my thoughts for a second...
so, tell me: where's the real haydar?
true... and if i don't get an answer, then i'll only have wasted more time.
still, the miners watch fights in their spare time. it's less pretentious than that theater they have on the surface.
huh? you have a gift for me too, master yanqing?
...who're you calling little miss pink!?
ah, how wonderful. everyone's keeping their promises today.
what about you, then? is this the moment you finally find the "death" you've been looking for?
the puppets are gathering around the frame. are they expecting us to enter it?
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near...
it is as if we have returned to the moment when the laws of eternity were first established. your will today is as strong as it was back then.
alright then. your turn now, my little friend. toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
let me see which one we should try first...
"empathy"? hmm, i see... this is valuable knowledge indeed.
anyway, i should have already taken care of most of the things on the list. there are still a few symbols that i can't decipher, but... i don't think they're anything too super important.
what? you want to help me with my thesis?
not only that, urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," to become the most popular in inazuma.
also, please stop making it sound as if i somehow need the company.
to be honest, i've always been pretty good at observation, and if i'm fortunate, i might be able to find that special butterfly species...
and it's likewise for me. i have a wish i want to achieve so badly in the real world, but i can't. so, i want to give it a shot here...
i haven't done this in a while... i kinda wanna give it a try.
it's like i can feel... emotions contained within them. confusion... fear... sadness... and others so faint i can barely feel them...
yes. i don't know whether it was the sages or lesser lord kusanali who came up with the idea.
well, though the victims have received relief payments from the court, in my opinion, as the administrators of poisson, spina di rosula should take some responsibility as well.
huh? mister florian...?
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
but disposing of vache's reagents isn't enough to solve the medical supply shortage. many of my patients can't be seen promptly, and my stock of medicine is running low.
whew... who'd have thought just taking a stroll could be so tiring?
don't worry. let me think again.
...naturally, his sister was overjoyed. after all, as far as medicine was concerned, her brother had always been the standard she'd strived to attain.
strange and cute at the same time. it's a name only paimon would be able to come up with.
alright, it's about time to head back. pauleau should have finished the ending by now.
if rishboland tigers stopped eating foxes out of fear of diarrhea, they would have become extinct a long time ago.
exactly! we're xianzhou experts!
um... what's going on?
the hydro archon's true sin... was creating us?
i thought... i thought we were going to fail. i thought that... everything we did and all the time we spent was for nothing...
this is an emergency. i'll have to ask you to stay here for now. everything's arranged, and nobody will disturb you.
yeah, you just need to tell us what the trouble is, hehe~ general jing yuan pulled out all the stops to get us here -- you can trust us.
we are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
you're a fast learner. in short, this is the last chance to get inazuma back on track. otherwise, an eternity of darkness awaits.
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
i'm here to meet with some researchers, but when i saw you two looking so troubled, i decided to follow.
at first, i was worried i wouldn't be able to get to sleep without my normal bed, or that i... well, anyway, turns out i was worrying for nothing.
ugh, what am i talking about this for? way to get everyone down, huh.
look! there's a big crowd around the clinic.
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
you...! every time an important moment arrives, you hesitate.
and they were caught in the seawater... *sobs*
...yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player...
no, i'll fight, too.
and it's behind a gate. what are the odds...
every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
is this... an answer from this world?
i need to organize my thoughts as well...
sounds like the association really cares about their players.
i'm so lucky to have two great masters! but why does it feel like things are getting a bit weird?
you witnessed human memories leaking from the ley lines, didn't you? well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
...that means we must be really close, right?
but no... the more i think about it, it can't possibly be that simple.
mister giovanni... again? what's he up to this time?
it was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. with regards to the annihilation gang... i can also prove that what aventurine said was the truth.
i suspect the reason they're dragging their feet is that they have their doubts about whether the show will really go ahead, considering all the issues you've been facing.
traveler, if i'm guessing correctly... you were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
mumbling?! i'm praying!
thank you all very much. i promise you that i will create a bright future for inazuma.
they've taken on the duties of the guards: maintain safety and order in the underworld and compete with fragmentum corrosion for living space.
faced with an endless battle, i had to remain focused at all times. had my concentration lapsed for but a moment, the shogun's blade would have taken my life.
"dealt with before"? so... "death" does happen in penacony, if i understand correctly?
well, i thought since pom-pom can't leave the express, bringing a doll with us is kind of like taking them trailblazing.
haha! you're a pretty good judge of character.
wow! they've really outdone themselves! i'm starting to get excited!
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
still, it's all just used test tubes, beakers, and other vessels. no sign of any sample reagents, or lab notes for that matter...
how rude! questioning my cooking skills, the audacity!
no... we're probably gonna need some time to digest all the... incredible information you've provided us.
ugh, read the room! enough with the mean jokes!
huh? looks like the little guy's scared...
doing that would be ignoring the safety of my people for my own selfish goals. how is that any different from what the sages are doing?
so... how about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? i'm quite eager to have it back.
one, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
i bet, you were mumbling something about "stellarons" and "wishes"... i couldn't make sense of it.
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals... at least, it was at the time of recording.
wait, wait! master diviner, can you divine our fortunes for us? is there anything we need to watch out for?
i feel something that doesn't belong here... i sense danger.
we might as well just be direct and ask her where she is. she seems like the type of person who appreciates a straight approach.
thank you, uncle marcel. but i don't intend to go into hiding. i'm going to strike while the iron's hot.
oh? you're earlier than i expected...
oh, i know! it's that "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," right?
despite all the pain and loneliness she had to endure... she never once stopped believing in the beauty in this world.
then, how about you, good sir?
yes, it's still on repeat... ah! there we go.
there's just one thing i have to ask, one thing i could never understand...
hehe. so you noticed.
i think colter's got a point. both marcel and romeuf had my father in their sights for a very long time.
so, you were saying -- "the little oceanid"...?
or... did you want to hear some family flower stories?
even if the future is full of pain... we won't escape from it!
hey, the "me" in the light cone looks kinda cute, don't you think?
were you seriously planning to leave this stuff unchecked at the dock for days? that's way too dangerous!
let's search the area. perhaps we will find out.
but have you really been enlightened with new ideas? or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they...
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
erm... that would be awkward, wouldn't it? why don't you fly up and sit on top of my head?
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
that crook cheated us out of five hundred strales.
if we can get her to help us, we'll bag a stellaron in no time!
hehe, i really appreciate this. it tastes lovely.
this may be an everyday occurrence for you. but for me, this trip has been quite an occasion.
you may have heard that an archon's power is derived from their people's faith. however, i'm not as well-loved as greater lord rukkhadevata.
then let's face the sun and pick the first mint we find.
...i will have no choice but to fight.
alright, i'll give it a try. just promise not to laugh, okay?
hook, you're upset that you don't have a gift for your daddy, right? well, what about this?
whoa! stop! ah! stop, stop, stop! there's a big evil hunk of metal right there!
ah... general huaiyan's gone. wait, why does something feel off about what we talked about?!
obviously! how could "light cone me" be cuter than actual me?
the pleasure is all mine, "sole of the deep."
you can still run, jump, and talk as usual. everything seems normal, but then you'll start doing everything slightly slower than others...
he sold his kids to chase a dream... even if he intended to go back for them, it's still insanely irresponsible.
you already know all about me. there's no need for all the pleasantries.
precisely. now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the hydro archon, i order your arrest.
don't worry, we can keep a secret. just make sure it doesn't happen again!
i see, so that's the purpose of the box inside another box!
(...is he just feigning ignorance for my benefit?)
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
well, if that day comes...
strange... why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something...
yeah, i did say that, but this is all happening so quickly, don't you think?
i see... thanks for bringing me up to speed. the clinic has been busy while you were gone. we've treated many people -- soldiers and civilians alike.
but right now, our host is unaware that this is a dream. no matter how many times they're served, it will always be food.
...that story begins a long time ago. after greater lord rukkhadevata disappeared, the sages found my newly born self and took me back to sumeru.
hehe~ ready or not, here i come, naughty children...
huh... looking back now, it all seems quite dangerous... but i had the crew there with me, so the problems didn't seem all that bad.
as an orphan, i never knew my birthday. my adoptive parents took me to the overworld and made the day i joined the family my birthday.
hmm, if i had to guess, he probably received an order from the sinthe boss to kill my father. had he refused, he and his family's lives would have been forfeit.
fine, we'll keep our guards up. our last hotel experience was eventful, to say the least.
got it. he says the wind is too strong here at the port, so it's not easy to follow the scent.
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to...
it's eerie how quiet it is here... it's kinda creepy...
well... maybe it's better not to mention it... haha.
wh--what? why?
(the thief is likely using komaniya express to send packages...)
alright, i'm gonna give my legs a rest. i'll be waiting for you here.
yes, and it shouldn't be far from here. let's go and take a look.
well, you can get good at getting lucky~
the suspect is knowledgeable about the spina's internal affairs, has the means to dispatch meka to assassinate us, and possesses significant intellect and foresight...
the flow of turbulence may well have been influenced by makoto. but it took everyone's efforts combined to ultimately help ei. so this time, it looks like thanks are due to you.
mm, you're right, we need to finish what we started... let's hurry up and find natasha.
yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
are you ready? don't be too surprised.
ten years of being sealed away has sapped the underworld's vitality. now that the furnace core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
yes, but luckily, she hasn't been injured or jolted awake yet. let's carefully move her somewhere safer.
what she really wanted to say was this: "how soon do you think you could open a branch in the plane of euthymia?"
*sigh* seeing you again is a change to eternity... and a very nice surprise.
ah, then perhaps we should thank the stars that we were able to wrap both of your parts so quickly today. switching around the filming schedule would have been a real pain.
or maybe you'd rather try this? i know, i know -- i normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
...how should i put this? i guess... you wouldn't feed shroomboars to a sumpter beast, would you?
if we simply engaged her under the guise of king deshret's believers, she'd definitely be wary of us, and we may not get anywhere.
i appear to have frightened the people.
no clue, but i know one thing...
sampo... are we there yet?
hmm? what is it, good citizen...
but rifthounds attacking the sacred sakura... it brings back bad memories of that terrible disaster...
my first thought was, "has a great disaster befallen inazuma?"
as the raiden shogun they revere, i should not be the one to hold them back.
she had already become desperately hungry by the time we were chatting over macarons, so she swiped two of them right under our noses. talk about a sneaky thief!
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him... not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
it feels like someone left these slates and these words here for a purpose. but does he mean that fontaine should be destroyed?
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
well, good thing i followed the traveler here. after hearing this tragic tale, i can no longer stand by and do nothing.
well... i'd say we were the ones who backed him into a corner...
ahhhh, goethe hotel~ home sweet home!
you agree, right? i mean, who wouldn't want to be a swordmaster?
the fire was extinguished, but the kitten lived. it left that side of the mountain and found a little bird who had a broken wing.
let's go. we have to find another path...
okay, show-off, now it's my turn!
"happiness belongs to the noble." does this mean we can take it? ahaha, doing good deeds does pay off! thank you!
a great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the yae publishing house's ace in the hole. and i would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
the sacred sakura can absorb and purify the filth in the ley lines. after the rifthounds attacked, some of this filth leaked out through the cracks in the trunk and formed a physical entity.
alright then, let's bring this journey to a close!
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
the question is, do you know who we are?
(i want to tell someone, anyone, about this... but would that not destroy all i've done so far?)
foolish question. there are only two kinds of things -- those that must be done and those that must not.
huh? it's you... you were there at the fort...
who i am, where i'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
no stress, nat. just tell us what you really think.
as of now, i'm missing crucial observation data. i need the results of an observation to validate the conclusion of my thesis...
i don't understand -- did you not show them to my parents?
you're just here for the show!
hmm. so you've heard of it, too.
why is this guy suddenly getting all serious with kids?
thanks so much! ahh, you guys are the best!
great! everyone's just as heroic as when they arrived. so, what's the master plan, general?
i remember now. this is not just the balladeer's story... it is his very own memories. i made a backup so that it would be preserved, no matter what happened.
if others were to find out i agreed to work with you so easily, then, well...
that's wonderful. i'll be looking forward to your cooking during our adventures together.
(i just... don't know when these days will end...)
but i cannot go with you to the next world to find a new home... at least, not yet.
therefore... i shall allow you to leave tenshukaku alive
ahh... wh--what? what is this place...
don't worry, i'll keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't do any evil.
i plead not guilty. how can i be guilty?
oh, hehe... thanks for the compliment. i sure don't get to hear that often.
if i were to die now, i would only be a weapon. i believe... i should die as a human.
you know, the kind that keep buzzing around the room and distracting you.
i suggest that you act just before sunrise, while most people are tired and resting. you may find some important leads.
but he shouldn't know anything about me... he shouldn't even know who i am.
huh, mister assistant detective? you seem to be getting anxious?
that's right, i'm the first one, he's the second! we're here to help!
yeah! what was so important?
hmm... i'm feeling calmer now... okay, let's go look for more leads nearby.
oh, nothing. let's tell the people here to gather at "a moment of dreams" after they wake up.
a patient's medicine doesn't just reveal their illness. it also offers a window into their desires and needs.
the sacred sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously i get to prune it exactly how i like it.
we'll be back soon, don't get too comfortable!
stay safe, now! and tell me if you hear anything interesting -- i'll treat you to afternoon tea in exchange!
no, it's fine. we're just about done here.
...you think so? i actually think it's pretty snazzy.
...he looks like a skilled fighter, the covert kind. he has large palms, yet his fingers are slender and nimble. i reckon he has experience using knives, like a short sword or dagger...
silence on the set! lights, kamera, action!
yeah! alright, let's go! to the sleepless earl!
we hardly saw any animals, let alone people.
tell me, then...! if i'm not the real hydro archon, then who is?
i'm feeling nervous, but excited at the same time!
what the heck is she talking about? master diviner, did you actually say that at the time? i can't remember.
and there he goes again... i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
look, it's antonia! the miners and vagrants are all in the same spot.
see you in the qualifiers. blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
the ipc soldiers are well-equipped -- it wouldn't be wise to fight them head-on. captain, what do you have in mind?
wait, when did this happen exactly?
returning home is the most important thing to you. i've come to understand that during our travels.
it requires one to take their sword firmly in both hands and cut down the hopes and dreams of others... even those of one's closest companions.
mister oswell? i thought you headed back home with mom. how come...?
apart from the incense that helps you sleep, there's also... something i trust you will like.
(the contents were light, and were no larger than an envelope...)
my father always had a lot of unrealistic expectations for me, but the more that he tried to get me to become like him, the less i wanted to listen to what he had to say.
well hang onto it, it's cute.
i thought it would turn out poorly because i felt rather rigid. but it actually looks much more natural than i'd imagined.
this information regarding your past also dismantles your prior "timing" defense.
anyway, give these a try, fresh out of the oven! there's three for each of us.
i'm sorry, you probably just wanted a relaxing stroll, and here i am dumping all this heavy stuff on you.
you are free to choose how you want to live your lives, but as your archon, i should first make this information known to everyone.
as archon, she still reserves the right to influence the final verdict.
she was built to resist erosion. her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
the real dunyarzad's consciousness has indeed disappeared. it can no longer endure the constant dream harvesting.
look, i'm sure you must be curious about the information i received from the fatui in return for my gnosis, right?
anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much -- it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
so you do know something else, melus.
that's right. how do you get rid of the next big thing? you replace it with the next next big thing.
well, we're back... just being here again is enough to make me feel dizzy...
okay, so get this: there's this creepy laboratory in our institute where strange things happen.
what exactly would that look like? i can't wait!
oh, so that's... what happened... ahaha... guess i got a bit ahead of myself just now. back to what you were doing, everyone. you can all just pretend like i didn't say anything...
should we wait here, or go find the messenger from the divination commission?
oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
bronya! and... topaz? you're here too?
gardes, take vacher away!
huh? what's this about winning something?
no, it's not like that. if it's daytime, all i need is an astrolabe...
so what did the gardes say? did the criminal escape through the vent?
i simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. she's more fragile than i'd imagined.
what flavor of biscuits would you like, mister snezhevich?
hehe, well said. i am proud of your decision!
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
i'll come and have a seat here more often, if you don't mind.
...a few hours? *sigh* do you have any vacancies?
it's a vicious cycle... the less i sleep, the more mistakes i make. the more mistakes i make, the harder it is for me to sleep...
hehe, don't you worry about that, urakusai. arrangements are being made.
now, from the gold, blue, and rainbow decks of cards, please pick the deck that fits you best.
it is a pity that i can't help her retrieve her lost memories.
everything was ready to go, and i was positive that i'd be able to get some great data.
aaah! stop it!
does that mean he wants to fight us during the charmony festival?
but all of my understanding and stirred feelings probably can't even account for even one percent of the pain they've experienced.
thanks, huohuo! you've already been a huge help by teaching me how to use the exorcising tools! even though i've only been learning swordplay for a short time, i'm confident i can take down the ipc mechs.
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
as for what has triggered this change, i believe it must be the loss of his vision. for to be stripped of one's vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel...
it's not that i don't understand her at all, but i... i just can't deal with this yet.
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
anyway, thank you for the info. i'll be sure to take note of everything you mentioned.
but the equipment was a little heavy, and i didn't notice that the ground was muddy and some spots were unstable.
and the atmosphere here... is completely different from the previous two scenes.
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
i thought things were finally looking up as i managed to dodge prison during my recent trailblazing expeditions! but now it looks like i'll be back behind bars again...
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe... an explanation.
rest...? but my deadline's just around the corner. i don't think i can afford to rest right now...
looks like you two are in a pickle. why not consult someone who always tells you everything she knows?
even though i am utterly unlike makoto, and can never become the person she was, i still need to do the things that she would have done.
the elemental power inside the crystal is completely identical to that of the fungus.
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but... there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
i'll bet that's a gift to mini durin from the three goddesses of this world!
rumors are abroad that someone's scheming against melusines, and that you're investigating the case.
there won't be any further gaps for you to exploit.
it's actually not new, i just never had the right occasion to try it on.
if the explosives do go off, not only would the people of poisson be in danger, any aquabuses using the line would plummet to the ground.
that's right! i'm your ancestor!
but we can't lose our momentum, master yunli!
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
ugh, whyyy... i still wasn't able to fall asleep yet... can't i just try a little longer? *groan*
yes, and for that, i'm sorry.
...well, this is how it turned out.
however, thanks to your memories, now we still have a chance to turn the tide.
...sounds like you two are getting along! what's numby saying?
...but it's impossible to sit on the sidelines, right?
...actually, i was wondering if diviner fu could do me a favor.
huh? you're not coming with us?
see those oracle pillars over there? just use the magic thread to connect them together in a specific pattern, and the goddess of prophecy will answer your prayers.
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
i think so too, but for now, let's focus on giving her a great atmosphere to grow and thrive. she can commit to us once she's older, and can really make that decision for herself.
if you lie to us, we'll be back!
don't worry, the express crew keeps its promises. we won't disappoint you.
hey, that's enough! picking on a kid, are we?
don't worry about that. i'm lesser lord kusanali, after all.
i sent people to hotel debord to investigate, but whoever did this left no trace at all.
lack of sleep hinders my ability to focus, and if i can't focus, i can't do any proper research or thinking. i'm stuck in a vicious cycle.
...half an amber era ago?
have you seen our weapons anywhere, sir?
catch up to greater lord rukkhadevata.
huh, so everyone saw the same thing? i remember... it was a room, and then through a mirror, i came to a long hallway...
with their stronghold exposed, i doubt the balladeer is stubborn enough to try and retaliate now on his colleagues' behalf. it would be more trouble than it's worth.
now, gather around, everyone, and join me as we make the night sky of this wonderful city turn once more!
you may not need it right now, but it should be helpful in certain situations.
what happened at the opera house made us realize that lyney's case and my father's may be related. we're trying to re-investigate the details of my father's old case.
we know from the case of the serial disappearances of young women that fontainians can be dissolved in primordial seawater...
the strategic investment department comprises the ipc's most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.
well, as luck would have it, i happen to be in a good mood today. how about i tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
it's always easiest to just run away from your problems. but that never fixes anything. you can't get around the obstacles without facing them.
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
looks like we've got to help those guys kneeling down over there calm down a bit, right?
but she doesn't seem to be able to move or talk...
miss hu tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
don't worry, this is my treat.
well, no time to dwell on that now. let's get back to filming.
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
then... i've something private to take care of regarding that galaxy ranger. let's leave things there, shall we?
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
haha, it's probably because i expended too much elemental energy at once. haha... i'll be fine. don't worry about me.
hey, if you keep inflating my ego like this, i might just float off into the sky with my parasol.
or perhaps the ley lines did not have the power to sustain him for very long. as was the case with the memory we saw earlier.
you've probably never seen what your planet looks like, right? i took this one. behold, jarilo-vi...
were... were you upset, clorinde?
tell me this. why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? why now?
wow, this would be the perfect location for shooting a film.
pom-pom can't just leave the express whenever they feel like it. you didn't know?
the prescription's on this side, but on the back there's... huh? so that's what this is all about!?
phew... so are we all good here, or what?
hey, where are you going? the snowshine lamps are the other way.
satomi is yae publishing house's ace in the hole. her specialty is that she can write all kinds of completely different stories, and all under different pen names. as for what those names are, well, that's a trade secret.
yes. although the signal was choppy and had some interference, we still managed to receive two messages from you when you were outside.
come on. don't crack jokes at such a serious moment.
before that, clorinde would have meals with us and even stay over at the spina some days. she was on great terms with papa as well.
eh, what's that? it looks like there's something on clockie's face.
we're lucky this guy caught us on the way down!
regardless, i need to first investigate the sages' motives, make things right, and punish them if needed... but i'll have to be discreet, or they'll see me coming.
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
this doesn't seem right to me. wanna try again?
this is a place i once sealed off with my own hands... the entrance to raiden makoto's realm of consciousness.
well, let's hear it, shall we?
well, since you asked so nicely...
then it seems like we've reached a consensus. i have a feeling that this will turn out to be the most mesmerizing performance of your lives.
don't worry. i don't think my parents will be picky about the flowers they get. quick, that florist is looking at us.
and... *sigh* let's just say there's another devastating and unforgettable failure i had.
anyway, i actually came over to let everyone know that we're all done for today. you can go home and get some rest!
in all honesty, your past experiences have made you a useful asset to sumeru and to me. winning you over was indeed a part of my plan.
thank you for helping us, and i'm truly sorry.
as one who is thrown into the sea, though he fights back desperately against his predicament, it does nothing to prevent his descent into the depths.
sure, that would be nice.
...after all, the akademiya betrayed greater lord rukkhadevata's trust.
did she fight to resist the forbidden knowledge pollution in such terrible conditions, all the way up till her last breath...?
but you're talking about real evil.
calm down. the war you speak of is over.
why would you think that? i've never harbored any ill intentions... well, not when you were around, anyway.
excuse me, any chance you saw a foxian lady pass by?
...uhm, nevermind. let's hurry over to the next stage.
hah! see, they weren't brave enough to follow us! freedom!
we probably still have a while until the stars come out...
sounds like you two help out miss yae quite often, huh?
...the auction, the one at the vagrant camp?
but madam faruzan, i don't want to fail...
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur...
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
the more time we waste, the more people will ignore our warnings and return to their alluring dreams.
three days... come back here in three days, and i will show you the evidence.
the akademiya's sages are determined to harvest lots of dreams in a short time, no matter the cost. they have to be up to no good. unfortunately, i don't know anything about it.
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return...
"happiness is the dream of the humble." does this mean we can take it? something feels weird about this...
geez, did you join the antimatter legion when i wasn't looking?
she was trying to lean on our friendship to get me to do an exclusive piece on the serial disappearances case.
hmm... i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
no, i have nothing to say. i am furina, the archon of fontaine! everything will surely get better!
you're quite right, miss hu tao!
...mister yang put it nicely, but the reality is this: we sealed the stellaron, but that's not gonna solve the problems on this planet...
look -- that big guy down there -- is he the one in charge?
anyway, it would just be a meal, so it shouldn't take up too much of your time.
hehe, hopefully i didn't wake you or anything.
wow! suddenly, i don't feel so tired.
something is actively attempting to cover up all the clues without my knowing.
alright, take him to get some rest. he's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
"believe in the furina you see on stage. she is the one you can trust."
let's have a count. hmm, doesn't seem to be enough...
i'll be sure to ask some people i know to see if they'd be willing to act as extras.
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
i wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
yeah... but oddly enough, when i wake up, all the things i was stressing over are taken care of.
don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the raiden shogun? that's all that light novels are supposed to be -- a bit of fun.
the tag on the tie reads "only for imperial master lefton"... seems like it's one of miss sparkle's personal belongings.
ei, you're thinking about this all so conscientiously. i've only got as far as wondering whether i'll be able to sell entrance tickets to the grand narukami shrine in the future.
but, i think we can't just ignore the safety of penacony.
hand them to sara. she can examine them for herself.
i know. march, get out of there right now.
(oh! do i smell a redemption arc?)
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because...
huh? so you could see through my guise? oh. i thought my impression was accurate enough.
phew... miss topaz wasn't kidding... mister giovanni really knows his stuff!
huh? wh--what's going on? did we fall into another trap?
but... my past isn't something i'm constantly thinking about. i have plenty of other dreams...
that case had nothing to do with him! you've got the wrong man!
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
ah, we're finally back! ...i forgot what fresh air tasted like... nom, nom, nom.
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
when you put it like that, it doesn't actually sound too bad.
well, it's nothing too poetic. i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived at the xianzhou ship...
at the time, i believed that if he only stood trial and was duly investigated, something amiss would crop up and prove his innocence.
that's right! if i'm not mistaken, you're also among those who wish to cut down the thorns and pursue the truth, no? and by the looks of it, you're not from fontaine.
can't sleep from all the excitement, huh? i can't wait to experience the dream world!
right? even if master yanqing says there's a mechanism in this sword that helps with cutting... can it really slice through a mech?
am i really that important to someone...? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories...
there are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward...?
(so you made contact with that part of his mind... well, it's true. betrayal turned the balladeer into the person he is today.)
i have heard about the thunderstorm, though. as to the cause, it is not inconceivable that, as you suggest, her will has wavered somewhat.
the footprints, which are half as big as standard, must belong to a pepeshi person.
svarog? that name sounds familiar...
i would like to book the opera epiclese for an event. you see...
agreed! okay, let's continue on. i can sense "his" aura from here...
you... aren't hiding anything, are you?
what if it can be converted to a different form?
of course. i still haven't really gotten used to a life without them...
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
the memories i have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
alright, this one's done! let's go find the next lamp~
i doubt i'll be able to sleep either... not that i don't trust you! it's just... you're a silvermane guard officer in the underground. there might be people looking to harm you.
hehe, guess i made the right decision after all.
why is everyone gathered here? and what's... this?
miss tingyun... it's great to see you so happy... but i can't help feeling a little sad.
a body that capitalizes on the balladeer's original construction as a mechanical puppet, with the gnosis serving as a constant power supply...
hey, what's that supposed to mean?!
it's not bad if we're resolving a misunderstanding!
please! you thought your crude replicas could keep me out? you appear to have woefully underestimated who you're dealing with...
that is of no concern. this is my recuperation state.
alright. well, i'll leave the decision to you.
look, a solitary chain. go say hello to it.
hehe, i didn't expect to run into you guys here today. are you headed somewhere?
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation...
let's wait for their reply again. though i know waiting can feel unbearable at a time like this...
have you heard the saying "don't wake a sleepwalker"? likewise, if someone suddenly had told you all of this instead of you learning it on your own...
ahem, i... i mean, i appreciate the compliments... but what's with the flattery all of a sudden?
her final words are... ... ...i'll let you read them for yourselves.
"it is believed that takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the souran isshin art, tominaga masanari."
quite unusual, i must say!
i don't believe anybody could be more committed to bringing this story to life on the stage than they are now.
i, furina, will use this trial to show the world the true meaning of justice!
hahaha, oh, the looks on your faces right now. too perfect. hahaha.
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter...
they managed to get away again... ugh, i have a feeling this won't be the last we see of them...
don't come close. this bomb is very dangerous! and... i'm the real firefly!
hmm... it's impossible to preserve forbidden knowledge. but...
will you be staying here for a while? or are you going to check on the other contestants?
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow...
i also heard that when dreamflux reef took shape, it was the center of all dreamscapes in penacony.
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
...the akademiya saw the plan to create a god as their ultimate goal, yet you only saw it as an ordinary experiment...
miss march took me to her room just now. it was quite cozy. i liked it very much.
it looks like "she" will no longer allow me to do with this body as i please.
hah, i doubt it... i mean, unless i somehow came here while i was unconscious, and don't remember it.
miko... a few days ago, some strange paper notes flew into tenshukaku, demanding that i "hand over the dog"... so i am here to see what on earth it was all about.
in my father's case, the culprit intended to kill both jacques and callas. as a result, they planned to act after hearing two gunshots.
i will protect you. once i gather more information from him, i'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but...
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise...
dehya sold her greatsword to raise additional funds, and then she was injured because she wasn't used to her new weapon.
my homework's somehow finished before the deadline, and my papers are perfectly written.
humans' yearning for sweet illusions borders on obsession, leading them to subconsciously resist... the harsh reality.
well, you can find all kinds of local delicacies here -- clockie pizza, oak cake rolls, alfalfa salad, and the classic soulglad! feel free to pick anything you like! today it's my treat!
no, i don't believe it! he never appeared to look sick to me!
a new case awaits, my dear partner.
by now, even those who never use akasha terminals find it too shameful and embarrassing to talk about their dreams.
my time to move freely is quite limited, so it's only natural that i would punish the people attempting to waste my time.
what opportunity? what do you mean?
but if spending some of my power will guarantee the safety of you and its family, then i am willing to try.
well, i just like to have a proper ending to every important memory, that way there are no regrets later.
(it appears to be encouraging itself. is it about to face some kind of formidable foe?)
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
i'm sorry, paimon. but we're out of options.
hehe... oh, don't worry. the change is already underway.
hey, why do we have to fight while enjoying the show?
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
that's because people don't remember their dreams most of the time anyway. and in any case, their actual dreams are being taken away from them by the akasha...
as you two probably know, greater lord rukkhadevata disappeared after the disaster in khaenri'ah. the timings of these events do line up, so your suspicions are reasonable.
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang...
okay, we're done with chapter one. let's move on to chapter two.
the ipc are all about their sci-fi sorcery, so it's not that surprising. wanna go take a look?
instead, i ended up catching a few mechanical devices that looked very similar to butterflies. i wonder where they came from...
wow, you really got under skott's skin with just a few words.
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing...
haha, well... they do sound like... a brave soul...
well, this whole thing isn't exactly over, is it? i do feel that we're getting closer to solving the serial disappearances case, though. don't you think so too?
(i've spent a lot of time out of the spotlight, and they didn't use my name during the curtain call either. hopefully, not too many people recognized me...)
uhh, not the most pleasant memories of that place...
alright! adding in the ones we picked up on the way here, i think that's all of them! let's go hang these stars back up in the sky!
th-that's quite high praise...
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes"... i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
i know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
huh. is it just me, or did you get a new lipstick?
after leaving inazuma, hmm... i think it would be easiest for you to go to sumeru.
i see. well, even though it's highly unlikely now that i'll join your crew, there's still something i'd like to ask... exactly what film are you planning to make?
final duel? so you're finally willing to...
my father was the one who asked for it to be built like this. perhaps our taste in exterior design is the only thing we occasionally had in common.
whew, himeko~ what took you so long! that last wave of antimatter legion came at us like a swarm of locusts, have you ever tried shooting locusts with a bow?
don't try and get me to cook. i can take care of anything else, but not that.
sea creatures are born into infinite darkness and live their lives in the depths of the ocean. it's a complete unknown to me. eating them is like swallowing an icky storm cloud.
...after a long flight, it still needs a place to land and rest its weary wings.
yeah! and it was an absolute blast, too. you gotta ride with us next time, miss nilou!
it can't be... it's happening again...?
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand... anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
you're right, so we should let go of the past. i suppose this is also a part of growing up.
because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
i once had informants all over teyvat, searching for clues and feeding information back to me.
seriously? who puts a lamp there... there's no way we can directly load the thermic core into this one...
goodness. are people in liyue really so complex these days?
forbidden knowledge once polluted the desert thousands of years ago, but was successfully repelled thanks to king deshret's self-sacrifice and greater lord rukkhadevata nearly exhausting her power.
how do i put this... you're no match for her at all.
i know what you're thinking, but i by no means plan to cross the boundary i've set for myself. besides, they're no longer looking for a replacement anyway.
come on, let's head to our next destination -- herta space station victory zone!
it's absolutely right about everything... i'm starting to feel guilty now, i can't deny any of it.
back in this office again... the last time i was here was... the last time i was here.
hehe, i knew it, you really are my best partner!
it sure is... *sigh* let's press on and see what awaits.
doesn't look too bad, how did you make it?
in that case, let's just sort out our findings together here. pity, i was hoping to take you to try some of fontaine's famous desserts, too.
alright, then... who will be my opponent in this trial?
and then, we returned to reality. look, this is your room.
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
i can't allow my partner to face the danger on the clementine line alone.
*sigh* how are we gonna convince her?
we can use the building materials that are floating around in the air.
then tell me, which of the ipc's achievements can you personally take credit for?
anyway, even though we didn't make a breakthrough, let's still compile what we were able to find.
does this "true taste" have anything to do with that mikhail?
...she disappeared.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
it's because people don't only live for themselves.
hey, don't take everything so seriously.
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now...
miss fu xuan, do people in memories always say weird stuff like this?
huh? so that snowy planet is our destination this time?
you're right. let me think...
it's fine, let's use the power of the fire seed. i can't bear leaving them in the desert like this.
hmm... five days ago, you say...
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall...
speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current inazuma?
aw, that's so kind of you! you just made a loyal customer out of me.
hang on, i'm still struggling to understand this. i need you to explain it again...
or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what i wanted to do.
i know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
they've got loads of it down there. i just chipped off a tiny piece.
perhaps what is about to take place has all happened before.
but just now... it all became clear to me. i still don't have the right to come to terms with fate on behalf of everyone else...
hmm... while you were investigating vacher's headquarters, clorinde gave testimony on my father's behalf.
we'll also need to make some immediate adjustments to the lighting, props, and costumes.
it's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. you can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful ei...
oh? you arrived a little later than expected. did you run into some trouble along the way?
no, perhaps people just revel in that kind of "drama." it's not something exclusive to people from fontaine, really. everyone's like that.
i just gave her a little wisdom so she could look at life in a new way... so that she could be her own person. but even so, she still...
i can, however, provide some artistic guidance from the vantage point of a highly experienced audience member.
of course! don't underestimate a veteran roleplayer's exploration skills! wait, i mean, marechaussee hunter navia's exploration skills!
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
at a glance, it was a kind of drink that could excite your mood and produce many pleasant hallucinations.
i knew you'd pick the right flowers. mom and dad will be so happy.
she's... terrifying... but she also seems really dedicated to her craft. i hope we can be friends.
*sigh* anyway, let's look at the clue we've found.
clara? oh, the girl we saw in the great mine?
alright then, let's go get our ticket to the championship!
mm-hmm, i do. what about it?
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
ugh... i don't wanna see a bunch of marches roaming around the express! one of me is enough!
instead of interpreting it as a result of their longing, i have to consider a more antagonistic explanation... someone is taking advantage of their longing.
oh -- i've been wondering -- you see that heater over there? why do they keep it outdoors? this city is so weird...
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
this is also why you felt a sense of peculiarity when traveling with her.
there's so much i wanted to ask you, but for some reason, i'm not interested in asking those questions right now.
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
well, since i'm here, i guess i should help her finish this. what are we supposed to be doing here again? finding a ley line disruptor, was it?
those kids better not have taken advantage of the chaos to go on an expedition.
hmm? oh, was i... was i sleeping?
i am very familiar with dreams, and normally, they lack logic and continuity.
you definitely sound like a... what was it again...? oh, amicassador! by which i mean -- nice speech.
i've confirmed that this dream belongs only to debbi. because, i'm unable to hear the thoughts of the other two people with her.
still... i will give them a little more time. after all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
never mind, at least it's memorable... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments...
so... this tablet was created not so that the hunters would be remembered by the people, but so that they would be remembered by each other.
besides, everyone knows that the main difference between a human and a god is the possession of "authority." gods can do what humans cannot -- that's why they're worshipped as gods.
stellarons bring about different disasters on different worlds. but every world seeded with a stellaron will give birth to fragmentums.
okay, let's go give it a try. i've already prepared my question for the seelie.
bam, and it comes out just like that. no matter how many times i've seen it, it still looks magical.
take them. i have no need.
are you talking to clockie? ..well, it does look like things are getting out of control...
uh... is he talking about us?
of course not... but you're not planning on doing something like last time, are you?
but looking at it now, it was probably another one of marcel's plots while he worked at the confrerie of cabriere.
agreed. i really want to send them home, so they won't have to wander around anymore.
i just... stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
i see. well, it wouldn't be of any help if i practiced for her, but i'll leave some notes that should come in handy.
and on top of that, just how much people still look up to him to this day...
how should i pose? help me out here. it should look good but not too over the top. this isn't coming naturally to me at all.
with pleasure. i'll give you a general overview. *ahem* you're probably aware that astrologists rely on the movements of the celestial bodies to calculate the past and the future.
he looks like he has a lot on his mind. we can't just let him go alone... why don't we accompany you to the artisanship commission?
...ugh, this is serious, y'know.
when you travel with mister yang, he'll give you a thesis on everything he sees -- if you have the patience to let him go on and on.
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
(wait, what's going on? why is everyone suspecting me of being a fake? oh, this is bad. if i get exposed here... there'll be no saving the people from the prophecy...)
but who among the three suspects would have the ability to control privately owned gardemeks?
you wouldn't be wrong for thinking that... i don't sleep much, so i get light-headed pretty often.
my trial? wait... wh--why would i need to go to the opera house?
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
i'm surprised an outlander like you is aware that there was once a change of electro archon... few citizens of inazuma are aware of this.
surely... you aren't planning to turn a blind eye to them?
never knowing what you might have to overcome... doesn't that sound exciting?
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of...
how are you feeling? any aches or pains?
i... i'm fine! look! look at me, everyone. my hand is still here. i haven't been dissolved!
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
it's so quiet... someone say something.
thank you, miss topaz. we're on our way to the hounds to verify some intel. perhaps you've had dealings with them?
did we do something wrong? we really did save the luofu, so why do you want to sneak off like we're fugitives?
i'm not surprised to hear that from a nameless. if you ask me, i'd say it was the unity of the family that brought this dream into existence -- and the dream has become just as loving and forgiving as the family.
now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits"? anyone?
i'm sorry, i haven't been sleeping very well lately. i tend to get dizzy from time to time, but don't worry, i'm fine now.
hold on a sec, i wanna get this on video.
thanks, but i'm fine. i'm used to pushing my limits... i know how far i can go.
why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
but that's not uncommon for her. if you remember, the justice had to interrupt her and ask if she was pressing charges just to keep her from getting carried away.
haha, then you're officially in the clear, thierry.
isn't that topaz's support squad?
"the express has lots of express friends, and it wants to find them and play together."
as inazuma's god, it is high time i honored their wishes.
the grand sage said, "go celebrate the birth of that god to your heart's content." did he mean something more?
so, your first possession, hmm? what was it like?
i think they'll be fine... plus svarog's devotion to clara is even greater than his hostility to wildfire. if you're worried, you could look for them over at the robot settlement.
it's truly the world's most amazing invention.
the rest is up to you. if you discover anything at all, make sure to share it with us.
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
i'm sorry, i'm sorry... i got carried away. please help us out, would you?
will you indulge my curiosity... and will you accept my request?
i suspect that those behind this have already taken steps to hinder an investigation from this angle -- but that does prove that this vacher person is a key witness in the incident.
seriously, i've never seen the luofu so lively before.
but then we heard two gunshots from the courtyard. we raced to the scene and found my father, still holding a gun, and jacques, who was already dead on the ground...
*sigh* i may not be for long.
i'm sorry... i'm so sorry...
...which means, with the power of imagination, they can change anything in this dream.
the garden of recollection has eyes everywhere. if he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the memokeepers -- i've warned him about that.
i... don't know, but i hope you do.
so you want to experience something new in your dreams... sorry, i'm getting a little confused. why don't you seek out some new experiences in real life?
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony... but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
well, the history of dragons starts from the very beginning of teyvat.
my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
well, what i heard is that most of our businesses don't actually use poisson as a hub, so there was no real reason to build a line straight to poisson.
stop deluding yourself. these new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
hey, is that supposed to make us feel better!?
"i've placed the third hint at a crossroad without a cross. you can turn left or right, but turning back shouldn't be an option."
as the god focalors -- the god of justice -- i shall do all within my power to lead you into an age of fairness and justice.
what say you to traveling together? we can help each other out on the road.
huh? i... isn't this a scene from the angler mystery?
roger that -- you can leave the rest to us. if everything goes smoothly... this should be wildfire's final mission.
that's a shame, but i understand. just let me know if you ever change your mind.
(the key to refuting lady furina is the order of events -- what lyney experienced and what he saw...)
navia can also use firearms, but unfortunately, her style is quite different from that of the characters in the story.
...lastly, painkillers. there should be a bunch stored in the old lab. hopefully they haven't been destroyed by monsters...
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
ooh, maybe i should commission a sequel: reborn as guuji yae. what do you think?
the true story is anyone's guess, but everyone aspires to emulate his success and be the next watchmaker!
i can still communicate with the world through the forest. it's just that you won't be able to see me for some time...
it seems like the intel we got from svarog caused her a significant shock... but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
what the actual -- that thing was flaming hot! you said things that never happened to me in reality couldn't happen here!
well, i've actually discussed it a bit with florent before, but i could never come up with any fresh or original ideas... it's probably because my idea of them is already kind of set in stone.
"monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. what started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
this memory was extracted from him by the scholars. presumably, they kept it to have something to defend themselves with...
who's to say there isn't an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?
hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," urakusai.
yes, i just so happen to have something that i would like to ask you.
well, things aren't always as they seem. you still feel like your papa was a good man, right?
that's right. i suppose i'm the "other katheryne" in your mind.
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
that you have piqued her interest. perhaps it's because... she has never seen an individual who is so unpredictable in the face of eternity.
i bet that hacker kafka pals around with had a hand in it.
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
the world is the same way. no one, not even i included, can understand it in its entirety. all of us are somewhere on the path toward truth.
aha! i've just received a message from serval and pela -- it seems they're ready for us!
yeah, perhaps. soulglad is a classic in penacony, and it'd be strange for a bar not to have it.
i don't want to inherit my father's grudges, too. moreover, when it comes to the aquabus, i don't think what my father did was entirely correct, either.
what...? i don't remember doing that at all!
you're right. children see the world as a place where anything is possible...
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality...
the path of the swordmaster is filled with twists and turns. it is no small undertaking to pursue the position of greatest swordmaster in the world.
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile... we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
actually, that reminds me... when will you be leaving, kirara?
could it have something to do with... that clockie that only you can see?
okay, got it. she's at the museum -- let's get going.
is... this the guide?
the situation gets more interesting with each development... blitzara injured pyro-one soon after the match started, and haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
*sigh* you rascal... you only come and find me in situations like this.
just trust in me, your archon, and do as i say -- never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. it'll all turn out fine.
...careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
so, for the name... do i fill it out with the name of my character?
losing a talisman like that is definitely a bad omen...
your sense of deja vu is stronger than everyone else's, yes? as for an explanation... you two received the blessing of dendro, and you also have special, sensitive constitutions.
my power was compatible. looks like everything is fine now.
but that can't be helped, right? we do many things not because we want to, but because we have to.
yeah! i'll show skott the power of the xianzhou swordplay that he despises!
now, we also know that every aspect of the vision hunt decree's promulgation and execution has been enthusiastically spearheaded by the tenryou commission from the outset.
soooo what made you suddenly decide to come down from the express?
oh, outfits... ah! that's the errand i forgot back in the city! do either of you still remember that girl? the girl i went to see with you two. her name is adele.
...please don't do this. he seems like a good guy! hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
huh, glad i saw this. i almost didn't even notice it.
resting? booooring!
it's okay. i find it quite interesting. i didn't realize that this was how ordinary people viewed the shogun.
i think i'll leave that to the shogun. the greatest threat to eternity is still the erosion that comes with time.
is this order really correct? lemme see...
it'll be a story about a meteor shower. you'll accompany her on a brief journey, do a bit of work here and there, and then receive the meteor shower as a reward.
carefully think back and retrace your steps.
yes, that is true. but now that the sakoku decree has been lifted, inazuma is no longer the same nation that once resisted change tooth and nail.
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
serval, we're racing against the clock! no time for head-wrapping.
gah, so you're leading us on another wild goose chase?
having made modifications to the props beforehand, his accomplice cowell then caused halsey to vanish using the water from the primordial sea.
is truth something you care a lot about?
precisely. it's all thanks to you that i made the connection now. back then, we all just thought they were some costumes that jacques used to disguise himself at the banquet.
i've got a lot going on right now, but i'll try to make it next time.
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
but now i see that hers was a gaze full of delight and hope. it was not just a duty, but a joy, too. she loved humanity very dearly.
no more unnerving gaze this time! hehe...
not all astrological phenomena can be directly observed. some are deductions based on other details that we know.
hmm? i'm great.
sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. you two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
it's okay, there's no need to argue. i'll think of something to do about the elemental power that will be used.
hehe, of course. in the time we've been together, you two have been everything to me.
continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
azure dragon, white tiger, eating less carbs!
...i didn't think he'd be capable of something like that with so little power left.
alright. deoteria, is it? how is your son's illness?
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
a--are you sure this isn't the real her?
this way... this is where we part ways. all of this is like... a nightmare.
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
the akasha relies on the power of a gnosis to operate.
gotcha! see, that's what you get for annoying me!
...no, i figured i could just learn it by drinking flaming potent tea.
(kirara's deliveries contain the treasure chest card backs!)
and in terms of reputation and renown, you've also done many great things in sumeru, yet they didn't even flinch at you.
aww... that's so nice of her. she's talking about us!
you'll have to wait for us to finish checking in first.
penacony, the planet of festivities, the universe's biggest and fanciest amusement park awaits!
oh... okay... i've got a pen and paper with me. let me go through them real quick.
that puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins...
yeah, it almost makes the blessing feel like it was just a tool used for my studies, no?
i'm sorry... i feel a little dizzy. ugh... i...
well... could you help me put up some missing person posters...?
given everything that's happened since... it's quite possible.
a memory zone of this level is mere child's play to a memokeeper. come on. let's head out through the front door.
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
i was scared of someone recognizing me for who i truly was, and exposing the secret i swore to protect.
it wasn't my idea! it was all that pink-haired fox acting on his own! all i did was... well... kind of... engage in free-form sword fighting?
i took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
why you set out on the journey doesn't matter. what matters is that you've proven you can choose your own path.
okay. grab the kamera, and i'll give you a scenario.
the sages wanted to realize their god creation plan without being discovered. the safest and most convenient way would be to build within the akademiya itself.
oh, i remember you mentioned something about strange dreams before...
*yawn* dear, dear. other players lose their games and throw a tantrum... you win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
did they just call us? look at their outfits... they're from penacony, right?
after we cleared her father's name, she became a lot more cheerful and outgoing. it's probably because she now knows for sure that her father was never a bad person.
you should be able to tell from just one look, like when you peer into a crystal-clear lake and you can see all the fish swimming around inside of it.
i sent them back to poisson, it's spina di rosula's place of origin and where we have our headquarters. there's not much for them to do here at the moment.
this mural is pretty interesting... looks like time hasn't had any effect on it.
yeah, i suppose that's true... with the way he'd set things up, if i had wanted, i could have just lived out my life without a care in the world.
that sounds like what others have said. but i don't have the time to wait for a reply if the seelie doesn't answer right away...
sounds like we did it. let's press on.
it was like having new waters flowing into a stagnant mire, causing new hope to spring forth, and the reflection in the murk to become clearer.
do you want to go with me now, or do you want to head over by yourself later?
so she didn't regret her decision. even as she sat in silence, waiting for death to come.
you did defeat her in court, clearing citizens of hers from false accusations -- false accusations she had nearly upheld personally. i'd imagine that she feels quite ashamed about the whole thing...
i've been great, of course. every day is a happy one.
true. dan heng's always saying that clara's really insightful for her age.
what am i gonna do... why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish...
haha, i see you're already a full-fledged trailblazer. you're right, we can't remain indifferent to those in crisis.
but the love that i've felt from everyone was just as real. i've felt it. they've helped me get to where i am.
yanming, what is it that you've prepared?
dan heng! bronya just sent all of us a message. did you see it yet?
hm, if the world above is a fairytale realm, then maybe we've fallen into the next page of the book...
this must be... when the crew first found me? i don't remember a thing.
before i lost my memory... so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
you left something behind? hurry up and go get it, i'll wait here for you!
though just pieces of paper now, they demonstrate our commitment. they're necessary to restore the people's faith in us.
...what would wildfire do with her? what would they do with you?
pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. now you're trying blame it all on me?
that's just called never giving up! hehe~
oh, must be the key to the big door...
don't be afraid. to that memokeeper girl... salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall is of great help to the garden.
good, you passed the test.
in fact, the heavenly principles has been quiet since the khaenri'ah disaster five hundred years ago. i used this point as leverage against the doctor.
i have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. i'm sure she was as happy as can be.
miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
that's why the shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. it's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
but before that moment arrives, we can still choose what we do... we all have this right, don't we?
so we have to clean up and reorder the footage ourselves?
and if teyvat is, in its entirety, a show on a stage, then you're just a "spectator," aren't you?
then the situation is not as complicated as you seem to have made it. after all, i am the one who appoints the tenryou commissioner. the process is quite simple: anyone who can beat me in a duel becomes the new commissioner.
hey, the guide is on the move, let's keep up!
i'm a doctor by trade -- please let me redress your wound. you don't have to suffer like this.
yeah, let's go! we've got some time before we board the ship, so let's catch up with everyone at dreamjolt hostelry.
i've asked them already, but they're both pretty busy right now. i just gave the members of the spina a few days off, too, so i don't want to bother them, either...
but now, i feel like i'm fully enjoying myself. it's really great. so, what are we doing next?
we are just friends, i don't see what sheltering has to do with it. tell your subordinates to leave, we have things to discuss.
hey! he was just giving an example! i'm the nicest girl in the galaxy.
that's right. i've always kept an eye on the serial disappearance cases -- my interest stems from a matter back from my father's time.
...you will see me appear once again as i have done today -- only next time, my blade will show no mercy.
that person up ahead... is he asleep?
good work, everyone! we're looking to wrap with our two main ladies today. i can already smell our success, hehe!
people in sumeru don't dream. what a strange phenomenon.
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
pretty simple... i just hope these tests don't take too long.
dreams have amazing power. they inspire us to remain resolute in the face of adversity, and help those with aspirations achieve their desires.
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
we all have painful memories, but we don't have to let them cloud everything we do.
isn't a robot shoulder cold to begin with?
...wait, i get it now! paimon, this is the real marechaussee hunter "treasure"!
...my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
her condition has stabilized. however, since eleazar is a manifestation of the withering on the human body, we can only cure it by finding a way to take care of irminsul's own withering.
on the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. but aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
okay, why don't we go there and take a look?
i've been underground for so long, i already forgot what flowers smell like.
so, sunday is messing with us? he said we'd have a final showdown on the stage, but why is there no one here?
yep. we could just about make out someone yelling things like "help me!" and "what should i do?". so we hurried up here to check it out.
what about you, partner? what do you think?
plus, it's not like you could've known what happened after we split up, and i was facing the doctor by myself.
three years later, i still don't understand why he did that...
then on to the next order of business -- let's discuss your companion, shall we?
himeko must be gathering information. let's hurry up and get going.
anyway, some of the monsters outside the city saw this as an opportunity to launch an invasion.
please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. in ancient times, poetry was all the rage. but nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
but even the gods of other lands, hehehe...
most of the people who participated in the disturbance this morning were my subordinates.
are you done ordering? then i'll pay up.
this dream... is becoming more and more separated from reality.
mm, yes, i thought so. okay, that makes sense.
could it be... some competitors working on other films?
always, but no matter what, we can't change the past.
the reason is you've already been caged. it doesn't matter what your physical body turns into, your mind will still be stuck in the same predicament.
(i can't seem to make a connection here.)
conflicts between the two sides are destined to continue until a balance can be found.
the same to you and your friends. you've just arrived and already helped resolve such a sizable conflict. i don't know how to thank you.
but since the three commissions work together to serve the shogun, they have a close relationship. someone from one of the other commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to...
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
wait... are you that stellaron hunter hacker girl? what are you doing here!?
"the book is selling exceptionally well, traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. when is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
how did it go? did you find the film?
really? wow. i dunno where you get your strength from...
since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy lantern rite.
because... aren't we supposed to be inside a dream? how could someone die in a beautiful dreamscape like this... shouldn't only good things happen here?
worse comes to worst, i'll just make another trip.
well, uh i...
what? you just matched up those symbols. is that it?
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
but even then, inazuma was left more devastated than we could have ever imagined. those terrible tragedies left great wounds that are still felt to this day, both on the land itself... and in my heart.
if a vision is a gift from the gods...
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself... it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
actually, i didn't really understand the problem.
only a deep commitment to his ambition to become the best made it possible for him to rise above the pain of these encounters -- to focus on the way ahead.
but the space we're in has been turned upside down. do you remember the characteristics of dreams that i mentioned earlier?
excuse me, madam. if i'm not mistaken, your name is bernette, correct?
he's in a dream now. what he said just now matches almost perfectly with the dreams he described to us earlier.
this is why wisdom alone cannot answer all our questions. we look, we see, and we comprehend, but the question still troubles us.
i've got no idea what happened there, either. but hey, it worked pretty well, didn't it?
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors... but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
my mind is growing even bigger. it feels like you could fit the entire sky and ocean inside it.
a gigantic and glamorous ship embodies discovery, opportunity, ambition, and conquest. it symbolizes spina di rosula's bright and limitless future.
in that case, it's unanimous.
we've collected all three passes now -- that should mean we've solved all the puzzles in the victory zone.
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
yes, and i just so happen to be good at this sort of thing. i'll see what i can do right away.
defense or offense, we need to pick one and go all in.
but now doesn't seem to be the time to indulge in this feeling.
the atmosphere here... looks similar to sunday's inner world. perhaps this so-called "stage play" is created with his abilities.
but inside a realm of consciousness, i exist independently of her. she cannot affect me in this way.
i considered this matter worthy of my attention. so i pursued them, and they led me here, where i happened to run into you.
i agree. tell bronya that wildfire will work with the silvermane guards on security matters. however, things aren't simple down here -- please also tell her to draw up plans in case the situation demands--
the rules i set for the shogun are... no, the shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. it shall not be easily swayed.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
we've talked to all three suspects, purely based on their conversations with me...
you're right, but the things we've seen today have brought back many memories for me.
can you hear that? the heavens are whispering to all living things, "it's time for bed now."
that was some speech, bronya! if i had to talk like that in front of a huge crowd, i'd be shaking head to toe!
but after running a few errands in the city, i'm kind of struggling to even read my own handwriting anymore, hehe...
i hope you realize how lucky you are. if it was anyone else, i don't think i'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
a record from my personal collection. it was tucked away in a corner.
you know... how much you're willing to pay me to be the director? the pay is also an important factor for me to consider, you know!
#uh, you sure are getting better at rolling with the situation, paimon. hmm, i do wish to see how skilled {nickname} really is with a kamera.
also, if our clapper loader could avoid shouting at the start of the scene next time...
good to see you too. whew, it's nice to be out -- feels like i've been cooped up inside for quite a while.
miss fu xuan? is that you?
she didn't completely eradicate forbidden knowledge, but if it weren't for her actions, the pollution would have been far more rampant over these past five hundred years.
i know your power more than anyone else. had i relied upon my strength alone, i would have lost this duel for sure.
also, i don't consider you a loner. oh, i don't mean him, but rather behind you...
okay, fine. then it's decided!
it's futile trying to escape. anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. after all... you did summon it together.
my body has fully recovered, and the shogun's will no longer fights against me.
hehe, don't be nervous. just follow your heart's desire.
that's enough chatting for now. i'll leave blitzara in your hands. remember to take good care of it.
(from the look of things... could the prime minister be the evil sorcerer? or... could both the king and the prime minister have fallen under the evil sorcerer's control?)
are we... in a lot of trouble?
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
thank you both for your guidance. so, did i pass the test?
it's the power of tuning... don't let the song distract you!
i'm not surprised. they'll know that i'm completely against them using this "wonder medicine..."
after my partner here put the dots together for me, i feel like we should try to reopen his case.
heh, well, i was the biggest star in all of fontaine, after all. it takes more than just a pretty face to earn a reputation like that. i know how to get serious when the situation calls for it.
"mister skott, a great sinner of arrogance and insolence."
that cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. if she detects any change in the underworld, i don't know what she might resort to...
yeah, you could say that. by uncovering the truth about the case, i was able to give her closure at the same time.
huh? arlan wanted to go on assignments just to experience stress!?
he's done right by us so far... shall we head over?
this is wonderful. my troubles are at an end! i can't even begin to express how grateful i am.
a dreamchaser story... if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
(all i can do is keep heart. i must maintain this act. it is the only way to save fontaine. please, "mirror-me." you have to succeed...)
no, he might have set up everything precisely because... he never thought i'd be able to understand him...
...including those of some of my closest friends.
so you've decided to resurrect a dead aeon? no one's ever done such a thing.
if you fail to make a clean break with the past, the past creeps up on you...
the test now is about body language... i don't think dialogue is allowed here.
erm... y--you don't need to go that far...
sightseeing... hmm, that does sound pretty nice. i haven't set foot outside the akademiya in quite a while.
to think that the enemy we've been fighting against has been right next to me all along, among those i trust the most... it's almost too hard to believe...
in any case, i wish you smooth sailing. i'll see you again, partner!
it is precisely because of their helplessness, because their visions have been taken from them, that their will is all the more precious.
no... based on what we know so far, there isn't any evidence to support that conclusion.
seriously... there's nothing inside this dream bubble?
the plot does not end here. there is more of this story to come. wanderer, are you able to continue?
wildfire can provide that while svarog is recovering.
after comprehending the hollowness of the unreal, it's time to revisit the meaning of existence.
yeah, yeah, i get it.
you know i would never do such a thing...
these are the people who have had recent dealings with the marechaussee phantom. they're usually hidden in the fleuve cendre, but i sent for someone to invite them over.
yes. five hundred years ago, a great catastrophe befell inazuma.
absolutely! i've learned a lot from my adventures!
so... should we tell everyone the deal?
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons...
you could go see how madam faruzan's doing. i've heard that she's quite knowledgeable about the desert, so she's probably made some progress by now...
...uhh, not that there was anything wrong with the way you looked before, of course! it's just... ugh, you get what i mean.
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
look! seems like he's coming around.
i should've been wary of him sooner... sorry. regardless, the family must be hiding something -- something about the truth behind the dreamscape...
your first priority is to prove yourself innocent, after all. i'm sure there is little that needs to be kept secret now... unless your "script" already has holes in it.
yeah, yeahhhh, if you say so~
because one of the lines said... i'll experience "death" three times in the land of the dreams.
three times!? this can't be serious, right...?
oh, was she whisked away by work already? i was just about to tell her how great she did.
other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. a little bit of this, little bit of that...
hmph, i'm not hiding or backing down. you challenged me, and i'm here to accept it.
(it looks really sleepy. why doesn't it go to sleep?)
huh, another challenge?
it's just, people in the underworld still need a doctor...
that was to be expected, of course. the guilty can never produce proof of their innocence.
i can feel its power lingering and shifting around us. sometimes it feels distant, but other times it seems close. this is its way of warning us.
including the beginning of your twin's journey recorded in irminsul. what exactly happened before and after that point? i want to know as well.
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear...
...this is the approach ei has come up with for realizing eternity.
no one is any the wiser as another day passes in the dream, and so begins another samsara cycle...
as far as i know, that nation operates on a judicial system.
as expected of my partner! i just knew you'd return in the nick of time!
even though marcel's faction has been dissolved, we still don't know anything about romeuf's whereabouts. if they're still trying to get revenge on us...
unfortunately, the semifinals is where my journey ended. the reason being...
it's not that the dreams are getting deeper, it's the owners' attachment to the dreams that's getting stronger.
things are on the mend, but it's a slow process. some people may never recover from the trauma they experienced.
we need to hurry and prevent the birth of that false god.
...the votes are completely even! ugh, i don't know what to do -- both sides have really compelling arguments.
people who know about my past might think i've suffered a lot of misfortune, but i don't see it like that at all.i count myself lucky to have received so much love in life.
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
the exchange served as both punishment for the doctor, as well as a boon of new knowledge that i couldn't refuse as the god of wisdom.
people love you so much and... and they've missed you so much over the past five hundred years. i... i am exactly the same. so how...
ugh, it's so cramped in here...
whoa! my sword is talking!
the two promised they would spend their whole lives together, but the little bird did not have long left to live. it passed away soon after. after burying the bird, the kitten left the mountain for good.
i know... but it's still a shame, don't you think?
now, i'd love to hear your suggestions on how to defeat skott.
card games these days are rather ingenious.
it's a cinch. this music box -- the "invitation" received by the annihilation gang... there are latent memories that linger on it yet.
also, he's so cruel to his shroom buddies, when they could have been friends... it's not just his loss, either. it brings all the other contestants down.
it must be difficult for asta. being the lead researcher isn't easy.
were you waiting here for me? did we manage to make any progress on the statue?
i mean, it's not often we get the chance to stay there -- and i really miss their pillows!
hmm... i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
it's trying to say that when they've suffered enough and reached the end of their life, they become a tumor of the withering.
monsieur neuvillette just saw the amount of bags we had, and offered to take them back for us.
seems like you've given her a boost of confidence with your encouragement.
so, the final conclusion is...
...but after seeing it for myself, i can totally see why people are so taken in by it.
unfortunately, that didn't really work out. instead, legends of "the seelie" started going around. hehe, but that's alright.
"sacrificed herself," huh... sure. yeah. that's the whole story...
i'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
hehe, since you are willing to admit that, i suppose that means we can still be friends?
by the harbor's grace, a lone boat lies in rest, let the moon give chase, for here begins our quest.
to me, that would be a family portrait. i've always been super jealous of other people's family photos...
biological tissue? does this crate contain living things?
the atmosphere here is so different now... it's so lively!
back here again...
another wubbaboo! ...it's crying?
okay, i'm ready to head back now.
(well, they guessed right about one thing: tatarasuna was sabotaged.)
the right to punish inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. not yours, signora.
but the truth is right here in front of my eyes, and i can't deny it.
her handwriting here gets patchier and more illegible by the line... she probably didn't have much strength left.
hmm, well, she's always been in a fragile state. if she knew that there was another "layla" who's always taking care of everything...
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
worth focusing on? ...oh, no problem. i'll leave it to you then.
if people can become water, does that mean that the water tank's real use was as a means to hide water stains? and if cowell was targeting that girl...
well, we've ascertained the state of the crime scene.
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
no, forget about winning or losing, layla! it'll be fun either way!
though i occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it -- i can't exactly avoid seeing it at the grand narukami shrine, after all -- my fate is intimately intertwined with the sacred sakura.
let's keep moving. it might be hard to believe, but being out and about is making me feel a lot better than usual.
it has been a long time. we have not seen each other since the resolution of the tenryou commission crisis.
i gave away my true identity when i restored everyone's minds, which means we've lost another one of our trump cards.
mm... it did seem like he had a kind of... tunnel vision. and it sounded like he was holding himself to unreachable standards to attain his dreams.
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown...
what happens next is going to blow your mind...
i'm gonna miss you twirly-whirly... take good care of my best shroom-buddy.
once dunyarzad could no longer bear the akasha harvesting her dreams, her consciousness began to dissipate -- but this also meant it escaped the akasha's control.
mona megistus the astrologist said that those who constantly use astrology to obtain things that shouldn't be theirs will eventually lose the "blessing from the stars."
it's nothing, it just feels like people are getting along better since your unannounced disappearance...
i wish to borrow a tea set from the yashiro commission.
alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. come on, off we go.
you needn't worry. the leader of watatsumi island took some troops to clear the place out. she's also issued a strict ban on the use of delusions across the whole army.
by the time i turned around, the person had already vanished. so i handed it over to a nearby hound. i heard there were many similar reports before the charmony festival started.
they're all just *burning* remembrances... a stark contrast to this deep sea.
uh... is this my room? i didn't get a chance to tidy up. don't judge...!
who's in charge here? how can they just let kids attack each other...?
there'd be no point in him lying to me in the letters. still, it's possible he may have gone completely insane before he started writing them...
which is precisely why i've decided to revive the irodori festival by...
that's really amazing. statistically speaking, continuous dreams are extremely rare.
yeah, you didn't drag us in. we got involved of our own accord.
what if i told you it was a secret art from the grand narukami shrine, and that i had the balladeer down on his knees begging for mercy in an instant... would you believe me?
i'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. unfortunately though... it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
and why do you still collect even more during your travels?
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
kirya and edgar... are one and the same.
but master yanqing, facing you in a duel... do i really stand a chance?
pajamas, hot water bottle, pom-pom doll... that should be everything! let's go!
(i think she's enjoying herself...)
...i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go...
time travel is extremely difficult to perform. the current situation probably has something to do with the disturbances in the ley lines...
we've already met two people who ran off to the countryside alone and got caught in dangerous situations by falling to the temptations in their dreams.
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
haha, hang in there paimon! the hard part's nearly over. after that, it's downhill all the way!
i see... it all makes sense now. you must've used most of the budget to pay for the copyright.
(looks like this isn't gonna work...)
you know, if you smiled a little more, you'd definitely get more business, and i bet that would make your life just a little bit sweeter! i'm not saying it's guaranteed to work. it's just a tip!
it's unfortunate -- the six-phased ice that once enveloped her carries its own mysteries, and miss march has amnesia about her own past...
it is not destiny that shapes us, but we who shape destiny.
then let's go. we'll take a boat over.
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration... what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
i actually grew up in the orphanage. it wasn't until i was adopted by an overworld family that life changed for me.
not quite. i only want to ask, how exactly did she become a galaxy ranger?
but the way i see it, his situation is much worse than my other self's... she just hadn't found what she wanted to do at that moment, which is why she felt lost.
how did it go? did you find the ingredients?
forget it, i don't kick people when they're down, even if they annoy me.
it's... so quiet here.
er... just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it...?
could it be...? that never even occured to me... but i guess it's not impossible!
did you hear that! she just called me "my lovely lady"...!
goodness, what's all the commotion over here? discussing something interesting behind my back?
this is the grand narukami shrine, after all. ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the shogun herself...
kaveh, meanwhile, knows what he wants to do -- he's convinced that he has to win -- and yet, he still seems conflicted...
hey! d--don't scare me! i'm sure there's a scientific explanation for this, right?
it's at the rivet town plaza, right? let's hit the road, there's no time like the present!
oh! boss svarog's robots! what's his deal?
nice to meet you, i'm natasha -- an underworld doctor. feeling sick? take a seat, let me take a look.
also, i've seen you instructing ayaka. that cold and dignified personality is exactly what we need for the older musketeer.
hehehehe...
...this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
anyway, any progress with the investigation?
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool... and it seems like a stunt they'd pull...
but i got so busy and distracted in the city that i forgot to pick the uniform up... ugh, so i did forget something important after all.
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute...
they should all be things i can use... i think.
exactly! i prefer the cool, calm and ruthless way of doing things - that's my kind of style!
isn't this fight way off from the actual storyline?
even if we catch up to him now, we won't be able to change his mind, much less quell the fear that many others like him are feeling. all it would do is turn him further against us.
there's nothing like the smell of fresh ingredients. they already smell delicious.
(according to collins, the pankration tournament only took place because the fonta company sponsored it. the company must want a return on their investment as well.)
in that case, there's no time to lose. there's nothing else to be gained here, so let's head back first.
thanks to him, i'm able to make time for the people. i do my best to make sure that they have everything they need... at the same time, i was formulating a plan to deal with svarog.
seriously, think about it, it's aether copying! i've only ever heard of that stellaron hunter girl using this kind of tech.
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
well, you did foil a plan that they were probably pretty proud of, and almost got their name in the process.
i'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *primal dreamscape*. how lucky.
the memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. but when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
so i'm glad that i can roost here in your nest for a while.
when the silver sting swarm lands on a planet, it looks like glittering snow has fallen. after every battle, i look back... and see the ice-cold remains of the cavalry in the swirl of silver fragments.
no no, after all they've brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. i just feel like i'm starting to understand them less and less...
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
great, well, now satomi can get started on that.
and i wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. all we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. or just explain it away as a dream.
what a wild and desolate sight... allow me to grant you the blessing of water!
she sure knows how to boss people around.
well... i do think there's something fishy with this tv.
as long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
come on, master diviner -- i'll give you a whirlwind tour of belobog.
got it, seele. we'll do what we can to help bronya out.
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
what's her deal...? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
i had promised to let them rest in peace here... but here i am, breaking that promise.
i feel a little awkward taking it by myself. would you like to join me? let's commemorate this moment.
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that...
what's the matter? i thought you were having fun.
pff, not yet, maybe, but... anyway! what are you even doing here? i do hope you didn't come here just to ogle at my fall from grace?
(we often see miss sigewinne observing the prisoners at work near the production zone. it seems like she can perceive the general state of a person's health just by looking at them.)
as for that aventurine... welt, i'd like to hear your thoughts.
and it looks like they went that way.
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
i just finished. and i really got a lot out of it... so many interesting and novel thoughts.
the looks on your faces tell me you found some good stories.
so tell me, how do you plan to respond to the fontainian musician? it sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war...
mm-hmm. judging from the current route, the boat of consciousness will soon take us out of here.
i trust that one day, her present experiences will become unique memories.
you can call me... the memokeeper, black swan.
well, that's that. but it is gonna be hard to let go of this bazooka...
that was when ei began to change. makoto was her greatest loss.
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
this was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
exactly! it's time for the crew to save the world once more!
i'm worried that if you were to continue dreaming like this, the lines between dreams and reality will gradually become too blurred for you.
these dreams may not be as pure and beautiful as they seem. some kind of power may be exploiting your feelings.
let me think... i don't think you ever actually told me what the outcome was. oh -- it's probably more accurate to say that both times, you never came back the whole night.
oh, i see what you mean. then let's swap.
blocked the road does stand, such is our hunters' plight, yet with sword and courage in hand, they march forth to pierce the night.
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
alright then. i'll come out for a while.
of course, i'll be there to help guide you through irminsul from the outside.
sorry, i underestimated the situation. well, too late now, i suppose. florent, where are they keeping their explosives?
or... we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
hmm, something tells me you just want to finish the free desserts before we break for the day...
i can go over the tasks assigned to the spina di rosula, since they were rather straightforward and easy.
...an aesthetic you share, miss acheron.
so lyney proceeded to knock him out too before stuffing him into that box.
interesting... very interesting.
hee-hee, you like it? it's yours. a farewell gift from us.
maybe all of this is rooted in your deep longing for her.
before the second round, he had a chat with the other me. he said that worries can be like illnesses -- they don't always have a magic cure. sometimes, you just have to endure them as best you can until they run their course.
*groan* if we're wrong about this, it'll be super awkward...
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars... as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
next, i'll bring you somewhere you can really have fun.
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place... you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
uh, w--well...
i'm really sorry.
if the secret had gotten out, the culprit would have fought an all-out war with the spina right there and then. i wouldn't have been the only one in danger -- all of us would have stood to lose our lives.
haha, look at you all, you've already gotten really close.
try to focus on that flower...
if you look around, there seems to be fewer people on the streets. i'm not sure if this is the case for the entire city, though...
no, because unlike you, she can't enter this dream.
that's right. i've also tried to investigate the murder my father was implicated in, but i haven't found a single new clue in my countless reviews of the investigation records.
it's hard to imagine that the xianzhou alliance actually agreed to accommodate the ipc's request, don't you think?
(he, uh... had no choice? times are tough.)
huh? i just think that he... well, i, ah, think it might be a little early to talk about formally pressing charges...
it's okay, i know. you were just following the rules. plus, we really are quite behind schedule with the printing.
well, if we can't see anything, that means we can't fight to the fullest of our abilities. should we... retreat for now?
oh -- and i wish you a pleasant and enjoyable irodori festival.
see, papa? spina di rosula's still doing well with me at the helm...
can i trouble you to access the records?
besides, if we fail to uncover what's really going on in this tournament, we simply leave haniyyah to her own devices... who knows what chaos might ensue.
by the way, where is your general? didn't you say he would be joining you?
well, right now, i'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
nor do i think it is any great shame. there is no lack of fine actors or inspirational stories, either on or off the stage.
but for the children who were born into this era, who grew up in this isolation... this will be a new life altogether.
choo-choo! aerial express, moving out!
although i don't think anyone will have any objections.
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
how do i completely relax?
how about it, this journey of beautiful dreams... was it to your liking?
well, yeah, but she'll be really disappointed...
i can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
that guy can't have gotten too far! let's search nearby.
greater lord rukkhadevata's residual consciousness in irminsul seems to be contaminated with something that has a very dangerous aura to it.
then next time i'm back in belobog i'll tell them i boarded the express, and i'm sure they'll give me a hundred different explanations of how it happened...
surely an onion can't be that expensive... right?
whoa, this must be it.
i've lost many beloved people and memories to the sea. even though i cannot stop for them, and must continue to keep moving...
is that the amount of confidence he had in me? and what if i was never able to make it to where i am now...?
it was a close call, i only won by a hair... i'm so glad i trained with miss yae beforehand.
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
we're in a dream. the concept of fixed spaces doesn't always apply here.
who are you? i don't remember you.
well, consider this, for all the horrors of the archon war, at its heart, it was just a game where a bunch of gods fought over seven seats.
whew, alright, it's decided... my mind needs a rest. so i'm not going to do anything, or worry about anything at all.
he was a very ambitious man who rarely looked behind or beneath him. for better or worse, that always made him stand out from the crowd.
master diviner? can you hear me? darn it... something must have gone wrong!
oh? so you're a mind reader now, too...?
...so that's why you slept for so long.
huh, so is this game already popular in belobog?
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left...
plus, he's a former harbinger with knowledge of many of the fatui's sensitive secrets. being stuck here in sumeru could make him a sitting duck, depending on how the fatui plan to respond.
i... i was just ever so slightly concerned about the situation you mentioned. yes. a teensy bit concerned, that's all.
hehe, no need. while what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
not to mention the monsters in that area... the situation is very dangerous.
she had already lapsed into unconsciousness by that point, so all i could do was enter into her mind... as far as you're concerned, it would be somewhere similar to the plane of euthymia.
"the person present, who shouldn't be"... who could it be?
*gasp* what a cute doggy! ...oh, you're here too.
well, now that we've made plans to meet again tomorrow evening, all we can do is pray for setaria's mission to go off without a hitch.
i don't see a switch for the gate.
so, have you thought things through?
if aventurine wants to bring down the family, he'll have to create a big enough chance. after everything he's done so far -- what is his goal...?
even though he only has a fraction of his full power left, that's still a fraction of a former harbinger. if you could accompany him, it would put my mind at ease.
fine by me. let's do it!
good morning... must i really get up this early? just let me sleep a little longer...
#{m#when i woke, i was all alone -- until i met you two months ago...}{f#after i awoke, i was all alone -- right up until i met you two months ago.}
wait, but we can't do that. very few people would see the statue if we were to put it on a boat. this statue is meant to be placed in the town.
thank you so much for coming to rescue me, but i also need to apologize...
hold on! that's a big guy over there.
let me think for a second.
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
you know, i've thought about it before... though my mother "only" wanted me to live a happy life, that's actually a tall order as well. in practice, it's just as hard to achieve as my father's expectations for me.
(i thought i might stammer, but thankfully, i was able to convey my thoughts just fine. okay, and next...)
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
oh, come on! it doesn't matter if she's talking about the old or new generation, we're all still a part of the astral express family!
i can understand how you feel. the things that we lost... they're forever beyond our grasp now, and that makes them appear even more precious.
wait, this looks like the star i found earlier. i told the guards to place it near the goddess statue... maybe they ran into some trouble up there.
after all, you saw makoto in there, didn't you?
that will be impossible if we can't get it to cooperate with us.
chevreuse will be playing the role of the older sister, tulipe, and ayaka will be the younger sister, iris. be sure to get close-ups of the main characters at the right moment.
hey! would it kill you to play along?
alright, everyone follow me -- i'll show you the way to the goddess statue at the top of the metropole. and stay close! you don't wanna get lost in my castle, it's huge!
in truth, everything we've done has happened exactly as the prophecy foretold... so now it seems we're the ones making sure it comes true...
so she was just like you!
hm, let me guess... fortunately, the next person you ran into was the director.
what's wrong? you look like you were about to say something.
you did quite admirably. i could see your determination and your hard work.
time for dessert. what? why not? what do you mean, "entrees come first"? ...they were only indulging me because i am the shogun? huh, interesting.
at this stage, let's revisit that scene from lyney's perspective.
alright, let's give it another try. lights, kamera, action!
she is a top xianzhou leader... mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again...?
that's alright. none of that matters compared to the dangers that apep is facing right now.
scrap metal? this is my sword! i'm here to learn xianzhou swordplay!
sadly, the past has all but vanished. but seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. you should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.
"if you're reading this letter, then you have succeeded in taking the first step."
i have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant makoto was. she predicted all the ways in which inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
i'm going up against skott soon. i'm so nervous.
vacher... that name doesn't ring a bell. i suppose he hasn't stepped forward as a witness in court lately.
whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, i'll correct you. and if you're ever stuck in a rut, i'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
...that won't be necessary, but it will help if you pretend to be a patient. help me investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
speaking of which, master gongshu -- what do you make of them? you're the best artisan in the whole commission, maybe you can pick up on something?
huh? you mean idrila -- the one he wouldn't stop talking about? but... he said he'd find them... and fulfill his duty to protect them.
hehe, alright. i suppose going out into the world will help my confidence grow.
ugh, why don't you go and marry her, huh?
thank you for all of that, melus. have you discovered anything new in the past few years?
now they are towering obstacles that i have no choice but to overcome.
that final battle especially! all the effects were super realistic.
i've known them for so long... and i know they weren't afraid... but... but...
more fixing? i'm getting good at this!
himeko! there's a celebration coming up on jarilo-vi, organized by the supreme guardian, and we're invited to go take in the sights and sounds.
three, two, one...
with her help, we'll be able to ease the underworld's medical supply shortage. that's good news for patients who'd lost hope.
can't you put a little more enthusiasm into it?
seems like someone wasn't paying attention!
what was that all about!? *sigh* it does seem like you're on better terms after the fight.
"the cold has revealed to me my arrogance. how can a child who grew up in warmth ever begin to comprehend a cure to bitter cold."
(even melus and silver... i don't want to admit it, but... but they're all dead!)
besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the grand narukami shrine unless you had a request for me, too. this is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
...so she's your sister. the landau family is full of talented young people i see.
i've seen your face before, stellaron hunter, even if it was only on a corporation wanted poster. they were offering quite the bounty... dead or alive. do you know the figure?
huh, i just found this in my pocket... how did it get there?
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
okay, listen up. everyone who's not working on this current scene can go with bonnot to look for the film. everyone else, stay put and wrap up the scene.
woah, that's amazing!
makoto saw a bigger picture than i did. in her view, a "dream" is more imaginary, more abstract than an "ambition."
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
(so, he's also using his real name... or wait, was that the name of his character from the very beginning...?)
my familiars will take the rainforest, and as for the city... there are a few nice kids who should be willing to help.
being as smart as you are, have you managed to do that?
what should we do? this is going from bad to worse!
general jing yuan?
life inherently has many rules and restrictions, each with its own significance and reason to exist. they can't be broken on a whim.
the answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
after his mother died, the child stayed in their straw hut alone. some of the neighbors helped to raise him.
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
the balladeer... hmm. sounds like some kind of code name.
whoa, the fort's packed... i've never seen this many people here before.
i'm sure you must have some things to discuss with her, too. i wish you all the best.
ha! i finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. oh, i must say it feels good.
hah! speak for yourself!
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
who cares? they're here and alive. do they look like a mannequin to you?
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions...
uh... that's like naming your cat "cat."
the memokeeper on the express...
ah, speaking of that, would you like to have some today? i mean, you've got time, right?
finally, he used the vase to knock her out, before making her change clothes to prevent others from recognizing her.
yeah, skott couldn't come up with a comeback.
he doesn't have a second personality, but... somehow, he still seems like he's at odds with himself in some way.
hey! that's not the spirit!
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
that's why, during this golden soiree... she is the dance's centerpiece.
perseverance really does pay off.
setaria is already used to avoiding her problems, so we must find a way to break through her usual sensibilities.
although i may not be physically strong, my will is as resilient as they come. i'll be fine after i rest for a bit.
i'll give you a clue: she's currently in charge of the shogun's army, she visits the shrine at this time every month, and she is our guest today.
erosion is a terrible thing. this body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve eternity.
when i think of everything that's happened to me, i feel really angry now.
if we are to believe that you are indeed the real hydro archon, touching this seawater would have no effect on you. all it should do is strengthen your case.
...i'm just speculating. in any case, we have to be careful when handling aventurine. he's skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. also...
those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
recently, i have observed a number of changes in the external world from the plane of euthymia. the most serious of these being the attack on the sacred sakura by numerous rifthounds.
yeah! of course, at times like this we're so lucky to have our crew. the family and the ipc -- everyone has their own plans going on...
ah, there's a red stamp on it! the seelie responded! fantastic!
i've had to go through so many moments like that for the sake of protecting the truth. as time went on, it got harder and harder to bear, and i became more lonely and isolated.
it's like i told you -- i have a severe sleeping disorder... and there have been a lot of rumors about me sleepwalking.
when the flatbed trolley passed, he opened the box and got into an altercation with halsey, which caused the loud thud.
anyway, let's go take a look!
w--wait, that's not exactly what happened... i still regret not helping out sooner.
right? i knew you were a gamer! wanna check it out on the way?
hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
as plans go, changing the deity's mind is a huge gamble to begin with. we can't expect to be in control of every last detail when we're facing off against a god, can we?
it looks so... lame.
now that you've decided, i don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. i think you're making the right choice, bronya.
i'm out, i'm out! it's gone bananas!
yes, and it appears again as soon as the rain stops. it's less like a flower, and more like a dendro slime that's trying to keep out of sight.
i agree with dan heng, we can't just leave her to the bullies.
don't worry. the decision is on me, i'll take responsibility for whatever happens.
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
if i can make it to the quarterfinals, i'll get to take my shroom buddies home and delegate some of my physical labor to them. of course, i'll take good care of them too.
the simple truth of the matter is that i can understand him.
this set of methods is already being put into practice at the rtawahist darshan by my adviser, drastically simplifying the difficulty of calculations involved in the triple-orbit problem.
but every encounter i've had since coming aboard the express has been strange to say the least.
come on, i've already sent them off. so anyway, how did you guys get here?
(the one with the motive to kill was jacques, not my father, and even so, jacques still had no reason to pull the trigger.)
oh, that's right! mister zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? good. we are running out of time, so let's get moving! chop chop!
for example, a loud noise outside your window in the real world could cause your dream self to get loaded into and fired out of a big cannon.
beynuni, or "moseis," said that i had never personally felt the pain of loss, but i have a vague feeling that this isn't true.
hook does always talk about wanting to go on a rivet town adventure... this could be bad.
that wubbaboo we just saw... it seemed a little upset. i wonder what madam herta did to the poor thing?
th--that was so scary! it was like a long-lost twin sister had suddenly... appeared out of nowhere! i can't believe it was only a bug!
if you stick the petals together with slime condensate, then, in the daytime, the glaze lily would act almost like a hidden container.
this has nothing to do with the aranara, and humans are not capable of creating a collective dream, which means...
himeko! wait, is that the real you or a hologram!?
trespassers are to be eliminated at once.
besides, don't you want to chit-chat with the locals now that belobog is full of life again? i know i do!
(clorinde must have broke character for a second!)
at this point, i would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you... but i think you get the picture now, don't you?
i've already prepared seats for you. come, sit beside me.
to become a god, he was experimented on and modified countless times. it was brutal torture, and the only reason he was able to survive is that he was a puppet.
there's a sticky substance on the edge of the flower petals. it's one i recognize...
alright, then i'll round up the spina di rosula and follow up on their progress.
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
no murder case this time around?
this monster---- all these creatures----are they the secret the family is hiding?
what does that mean? it's just a picture. are we supposed to meet someone there?
the best option was for her to directly interact with humans. there's no need to feel sad, i believe she was content when she left us.
you're back early today. did you find something new?
oh? i didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. you wouldn't mind it if i took a soak for a while, would you?
that's the boat of consciousness, which symbolizes reason here. its course is the direction our consciousness is traveling towards.
but what if the bigger war comes to pass? what then?
yes, i already know every one of you. nilou, alhaitham, cyno, dehya, paimon, and dunyarzad.
well then, are you having a good time?
why did you turn into this... thing!?
but when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control... f--from the bridge, i mean.
which leads us to why i'm in need of a high-precision celestial globe.
...sunshine! blue skies! good vibes!
thank you so much, mister wilder! we'll cherish every moment.
oh, okay. hurry up then. we'll leave when you're ready.
mine cart pin... mine cart wheelset... confirm... just like that?
hmm, i guess you're right... maybe it isn't such a big deal.
once the meteor shower ends and you all awaken from the dream, she'll probably realize what had happened.
it's possible. but what if he was still sane when he wrote this down...
hey! don't say something like that in front of these healers! i don't want to end up in some realm-keeping commission court!
thank you, master yanqing!
especially these days. not only do i have my light novels, but i've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
let's call it a day, shall we? and since we're in belobog, it means another night at the goethe hotel!
everyone, we meet again.
and i... i'm still really far away from being able to call myself the god of wisdom. moreover, the akademiya is also far more proficient at governing this country. my existence has little meaning.
this is probably ilman's dream.
i don't know where this feeling inside of me is coming from, but i feel very sad...
but i'm afraid it is much more serious this time, with irminsul itself already in danger.
"the nature of this memory is special. don't ruin the dreamscape experience for anyone else by spoiling the ending."
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
you're saying... you like how i wear my vision? you certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. well then, i bet you'd like to pet it.
is that so? well, in that case, we'll have to blacklist the fonta here, then.
but what were you doing here if the house of daena was closed?
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
don't you guys have anything better to do!? what did we do this time?
one down already! we're on fire!
alright, let's go. don't worry, now, i'll be coming along too.
they will definitely meet again, someday.
whoa, you're amazing! can you teach me? which animals can you imitate?
what does it feel like? like all your worries have been swept away?
yes. so, if you hadn't drunk that cup for me...
there, now you have a name of your own.
saved... your soldiers?
what's gotten into you? come on, sit yourselves down.
it's not my fault that i'm super popular! what was that saying again? my popularity has--
land of the dreams, penacony.
these ambitions have transcended space and time. they are something that no one can snuff out.
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
the shogun can't do much at the moment. come straight in and see me.
because i trust you! even if my masters have doubts, they'll trust your judgment!
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
penacony's golden hour is pretty amazing, isn't it?
it's... it's that hacker girl!
according to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
combat module? this thing's faulty, right...?
anyway, where were we? oh, right, i was just thinking about all the potential ways for us to break out of prison! we could dig a tunnel, or try to bribe the guards...?
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
and what would a festival be without me? i'll be sure to go have a look, too.
come with me. let's find a quiet place. there's something i want to talk about with you.
but didn't you say the watchmaker betrayed the family? and you said you were his companion, so that means you...
okay... where to next?
where are our rooms? come on, mister yang and the rest must be at the front desk. let's hurry up and meet them there!
looks like the next fight is you against me. let's just try to enjoy ourselves. it doesn't matter who wins, this is just a little contest between friends.
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents...
the monsters committed many atrocities on inazuman soil. and the rifthounds were always their advance guard.
eternity means never having to let go of what you already have. but on the other hand, it also means giving up on all other possibilities. that's just the way of the world... no one can have everything.
there's no reason to be upset by this. time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. so, you must be happy in the present. you should understand what i mean now.
(no, that's pu'er, the tea society's gatekeeper.)
uh, thank you... thank you so much. i don't even know how to show you my gratitude.
judging by the results, at least, i daresay i struck a good deal. hehehe.
i feel like a nilotpala lotus that's been reunited with its leaves, or a sango pearl that's found its shell.
a--ahh... don't say that... that sounds horrible.
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way...)
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me ei. i'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
we can't get through here. let's take the way around from the side.
all in all, he was only here for half a day. i'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation...
understood, miss march. i promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it...
hey, way to boost morale over there!
...oh, i see. okay, i understand. thank you so much.
huh? you don't believe it? just ask my classmates, almost everyone will tell you the same.
it doesn't matter how long i'm away from the forest, i won't ever forget the feeling of running through the trees.
this assassin first shot jacques, then turned to shoot callas, only for callas to wrestle the gun from him and kill him instead.
since that's your testimony, i have no more questions. it appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case...
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city... no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
excellent, then let's start with the scenery shots. kamera and clapper loader, you're up.
i know, right? isn't he adorable?
once you've understood her situation, come back and tell me what you think. after that... i want to ask for your help again.
do you wish to know the truth about the shooting stars at night? haha, they are but fleeting moments of luminosity. uh, you used to be one of them? are you a tengu warrior?
here's what i need you to do: go into town and find evidence of the tenryou commission's betrayal.
alright, let's take them all down.
hehe... that's why it makes no sense to waste your energy thinking about things you will learn tomorrow.
intuition, naturally. my unparalleled intuition!
i wonder why topaz would come to a place like this...
it's not as ruthless as it was before. curing the dragon of its illness has seemingly made it more open to reason.
okay, let's go and try our luck.
dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. you make it sound like i'm some sort of wicked witch.
(uh-oh! his only escape is...)
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards... we didn't meet seele until way later.
ugh, seriously! i was in such a good mood, too, until they came along and spoiled it...
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet...
...isn't that the drink peddled by the culprit behind the serial disappearances case?
when you're free, let's go hit up the divination commission together and see what fu xuan has to say.
and therein lies the largest complexity. derived and validated conclusions may vary due to subtle changes caused by the flow of time and shifts in the stars.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
th--this robot's a thousand times bigger than svarog!
i circled the whole area, but i didn't find anything.
at some point, she started going down a path that became increasingly difficult for me to join her on.
wow, that was fast... don't you have anything you wanna bring with you?
i wouldn't call it the "past," but rather... uh, this is a difficult one to explain.
i knew you'd be interested.
are you finally going to tell us?
that guy just casually throws this kind of question at us? what exactly is his deal? but fine, i'll answer i guess...
why are you fighting!?
...that sounds like too cruel of an ending to me. and perhaps a little irresponsible to present to the audience.
we've had to fight every step of the way for this opportunity, but we now have all of the ingredients necessary to stage a truly spectacular performance:
if this theory is correct, little layla's wish may yet come true. once you've gotten to know each other, you'll be able to freely communicate without using the wisdom orb.
sheesh, why do you keep asking me that? we're in the middle of investigating a murder case for the family. may we speak to your captain about it?
she's hacked into the speakers!
so, tell me. what is the matter?
so, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the watchmaker?
we youkai are not like humans. humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
i'm not sure. perhaps the fire seed was only capable of protecting one person...?
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy... it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here...
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
penacony's really thronging with talent... i hope we make it in time.
hmm... sounds like you know a lot about him?
aratani and kuroda, how are things coming along?
i'll let you know if i find out anything. consider it part of my means of thanking you.
that won't be necessary, mister yang. as the angler once said: "a true detective operates as effectively from their armchair as from the scene of the crime."
no, no, this isn't the time for that kind of talk. we have to hurry and find the clues that the seelie left behind.
wait a second... did you say "gnosis"?
whoa... the express is going to be much livelier now. but miss black swan, you'd better not use your memokeeper abilities to pull any pranks!
but i have experienced it all. that is why i have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
...i thought we talked about copying people.
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
i'm not sure how to put this... i'm really happy about everything that's happened, but i'm also feeling a little sad.
it was so warm that it felt like i had returned to the start of my life, and i didn't want to wake up anymore.
this really is quite the surprise.
so, you seem to be under the impression that i am able to offer some sort of help? who gave you that idea?
well, her reputation's greatly risen after that whole duel business with miss furina, so she's here in poisson to wait out the heat... alright, alright, she really came here to help me out.
do you ever get the feeling that the ley lines have a regular flow, similar to the way that celestial bodies follow fixed orbits?
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
oh, actually, there's still one last thing i need to do...
his jokes are like buried treasure: gems hidden beneath the surface. they're a lot of fun. hmm? well, which part didn't you get? okay, i can explain it for you.
...it all points to one person -- the boy who inherited yelena's legacy, her younger brother.
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
i can't bear to think how painful and lonely her final days must have been...
the balladeer's power was all but completely spent after your battle. he's no longer strong enough to be a strategic threat to us. that puts him in quite a precarious position.
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
quick, let's find shelter, or mushrooms will start growing on our heads.
but the only people left to consider are both technically victims, whether it's the missing girl, halsey, or poor cowell...
...i suddenly don't feel so tired.
we are lucky... the damage is not too serious. the yashiro commission will be able to nurse the root system back to health.
see, it's like i said: if you wake up and dan heng's not around, then you probably won't see him the rest of the day either.
if you truly regret my father's death, then why didn't you call a stop to the duel!?
looks like miss sparkle is adding a little spice to the investigation. let's take her up on her offer then -- mister assistant detective, this way.
oh? well hello, what brings you to see me today?
from now on, i'd like to cherish every single day of my life... even when it's not the smoothest of rides.
looking back on it, though, i now believe the most important clue was something we all overlooked at the time -- there were pieces of clothing left at the scene.
ah, that reminds me. you guys said you only came up here because you heard my voice, right? i hope it didn't put you out -- you must have other plans for the day?
the void is stopping the elemental power from flowing normally, which must be why it fainted.
so it's literally a helping hand?
teyvat's current peace was not easily won. i didn't personally participate in the archon war, but the way i see it...
but now, the youkai memories that leak from the ley lines are weak. they are no longer able to fly.
coffee... we can't really make that here...
so, the legacy is just a facade...
*gasp* do you have to put it like that? that's scary...
never imagined that's how we'd end up getting past the guard... that trick of clockie's really is amazing.
wait, could it be that the yaoqing people have some secret formula that could help me?
yes. theoretically speaking, it is possible to do this, but i'm struggling to imagine the kind of person who would dare go through with it...
now that i think about it, wasn't "illusions" hinting at the sages' deception of sumeru's people?
if fate turns that page, our paths will cross again.
traveler, do you have any information?
i know, i know, let's go and have a look!
no problem. i've got a few of those guys all ready to go! i just knew you wouldn't be intimidated into withdrawing from this year's show.
however, i feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so i used the identity of the shogun.
you slowly wash over the shore and sink into the sand...
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself... i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
as far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. they complemented each other, and they ruled inazuma jointly. so there was no need for the public to know the truth.
we can't trust everything kafka says. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
hang in there, twirly! you can still do this!
um... alright. ahem...
alright, traveler and paimon. we should go back.
if i don't do this, the shogun's rules can never change, and inazuma can never move forward.
ugh, i hardly see what all the fuss is about. everyone seemed perfectly happy to me.
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague...
oh no, i've already spent too much time chatting...
i grew up in a place like this. looking into the distance now with the breeze in my face makes me feel like a kid again.
no one questioned it, and yet its presence contrasted so starkly with the area as i remembered it... it seemed as if i was the only one to have noticed it appear suddenly out of thin air.
i see... i suppose that makes sense.
she thought she had escaped but...
seriously, you even picked a fight while drinking tea. i honestly doubt you have a life at all, let alone a fulfilling one!
it appears that the seafarer has nothing to do with the watchmaker. so, perhaps it's just a coincidence?
i'm sure you remember the entity that changed your fate -- the heavenly principles.
hehe. gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
i know, but the thing that i can't get out of my mind... is the present.
hey, florent, i hope you can understand that i can't deal with any more "shocking revelations" right now.
(this time, we need to tell the entire story from liliane's perspective.)
(but it's good to see that everything's getting "on track." there are no longer any voices of suspicion.)
although you are here and appear no different from the others, i can't sense your dream.
the murky mirror reflects the view of inazuma in a bygone age. spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
hmm... i'd probably use some sort of mechanical animal. papa once bought me some small clockwork squirrels, mice, and such. when placed in the forest, they can attract others of their kind.
hmm... i give it a nine point five!
(there is definitely more to mister zhongli than meets the eye. i could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
not a chance. even if their heir was someone who showed promise, their past mistakes cannot be erased.
let's move out then! but... where do we start looking for him?
and through it all, you also had your part to play.
this is wonderful... so it has left traces of itself after all.
i'll bet the audience has never seen such a realistic prop.
do you think... they ever regretted the choices they made? has my existence... made this world a better place?
oh, is this the marketplace? it's a far cry from how i remember it.
now, kamisato ayato and the yashiro commission are neutral parties, so i have no right to give orders to the shuumatsuban.
ippei? is that someone from the tenryou commission?
but if you do the math... doesn't that mean the watchmaker was around for several centuries?
um... i--i'd rather be mentally prepared for what might happen...
if we really did travel back to a time before he disappeared, that could explain why the villagers said he hadn't gone missing.
now that your stance has changed, i believe your future path will change accordingly, but it won't be immediate... you still need some time to compose yourself.
i thought that as long as i understood my shorthand when i came up with it, i'd be sure to remember the symbols when i looked at them later. unfortunately, i've definitely proven myself wrong...
hmm? hmph! a--are you not afraid? might i remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
well, this is the place.
i believe we're on the right track, but we just need another explanation.
i promise i don't mean any harm, and i'll answer all your questions. but before that, would you mind telling me who you are first?
then a second instance of forbidden knowledge pollution occurred during the khaenri'ah cataclysm five hundred years ago.
traveler, what do you think that "final space" could have been?
no matter what papa yelled, nobody else would say a word. eventually, papa must have recognized scolding me over trivial matters was pointless, because he eventually stopped getting on my case so often.
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
thank you. choose whoever you like. wildfire will take care of the rest.
now that i think about it, that whole speech about magicians making things disappear was nothing more than a provocation, a bald-faced challenge!
equally unforgettable, i'm sure. anyway, don't worry about the future -- live in the moment!
how should i put this... there's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
the ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. this is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
you didn't hit your head, did you? is the dizziness gone?
hello everyone! next up, get ready for the mega march seventh adventure, where i'm going to break the speed run world record!
too ordinary! hmph, such an uninspired dish will never have my approval!
so, following the clues in the script, i came up with some theories about the meme. that's why i instructed silver wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel...
hmm, i'll take "persuasion" and "investigation"! those are must-haves when it comes to missions like these.
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
ah, such an intense emotion... heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
have you heard of the complex illness mutual aid society?
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
i see, let's give it a shot! who says we have to rely purely on swordplay to beat him?
only sixty-three% of planets succeed? that's not exactly comforting...
...wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
a familiar flavor... acceptable.
purified filth quickly dissipates and will be absorbed by the ley lines shortly afterwards. in other words, it cannot exist for too long.
#uh, {nickname}, nilou... do you know this hat guy person?
she seems to be waking up now. well, this is goodbye. if we never meet again, then... i guess i did something right, hehe.
haha, you have a wild imagination.
that red-haired contestant... who is that exactly?
mhm, i feel quite a bit better, but i should probably still rest for a few more days.
b--but what about my thesis? we still haven't found the seelie's answer yet...
no! that end won't come to pass while we're around!
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
it will bear the name "firefly" and the brilliance she showed at the end of her life.
in principle, i should remain an outside observer. but you are far too much fun for that. i can't help but tease you from time to time.
ahem... okay, thanks...
i can't believe they've chased me this far... looks like we'll have to say our goodbyes. don't worry about me. just go and enjoy the ceremony!
please can you explain to us again the details of the case?
i shouldn't stray too far. dain and paimon still aren't back...
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
ah, i see. heh, this setup is quite handy. saves me a lot of work.
it sure did. apparently, for whatever reason, he went for the stars above the city recently. literally just flew up and starting snatching them out of the sky!
oh, come on... you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
as it happens, i also received an invitation letter via sara.
oh, don't worry, we still got a lot of reference shots out of the session, and each of them can be considered to be a souvenir in their own right. let's just keep the ideas we tried as backups.
you're a bad liar, sampo koski.
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
this again... don't tell me, it's gotta be...
still, i felt it was something i had to do. as i was saying before, i want to see for myself the things that i never could in the past.
oh, is everyone alright? thanks for your help.
but then the flood waters finally came. and the "hydro archon" did nothing.
after we parted ways, i was on the way back to one of our bases when i suddenly thought of what you said...
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
by the look on your face... i'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
so i told the spina di rosula to keep an eye out for leads. we've had unfamiliar faces showing themselves at the fleuve cendre lately. maybe you'll find the suspects among them.
that's the spirit! i'll come with you. miss nilou, will you be joining us?
huh? wh--what's going on?
in bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. also, sales for the book would only increase further.
...i, um... i haven't been truthful with you...
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
that will do. i will have the okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
in that case, why don't we go back to the court? i can pick up adele's uniform while we're there as well. it'll save florent's guys a trip.
he wasn't lying. there's actually a bazooka here.
perhaps...? fair enough, it's tough racking your brains all the time -- i'm struggling to keep track...
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
now, don't be nervous. just close your eyes... imagine yourselves as waves gradually rolling onto the beach.
did you know that the sound of thunder is the prelude to new life? *sigh* soon, this land will be brimming with vitality.
these dreams will always give you what you want, while reality remains full of pain and difficult situations... if you're not careful, you can get hurt.
what do you think, hook? are you willing to buy the geomarrow probe from me?
wait! can you recommend some sights? it's not that late, we wanna take a look around.
so, all i have to do is imitate that power while adding some of my own, and i'll be able to do what the fire seed was supposed to...
i'm just kidding, of course. i'm sure fish have worries of their own. i'm quite content with how things are right now.
oh, alright, alright. then tell me, when did your brother spar with domon's disciple?
she... is she running? no... running away? something's right behind her...
alright, kameras will start rolling as soon as the set is ready! let's make a film that'll make some serious waves in fontaine!
again, i didn't do any of the real work. i'm just wrapping up.
(liliane was afraid that she would be recognized if she left, so she changed clothes and hid, biding her time... just what one might expect of an experienced thief.)
hmm... usually, i would call this a coincidental encounter, but that doesn't quite fit this time... besides, it never even crossed my mind that a fatui harbinger would come looking for me.
but what do we do from here...? i can't just go back and start packing to leave.
perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
...how old are you now, mister officer?
it's alright, relax. i'm just here to look around. i'm having a change of pace today.
and yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
wait, miss tingyun, why are you still here!? you're too close to the crucible!
masters could handle them for sure! but isn't it asking too much of a poor little rookie like me?
i believe in your potential. it is rare for someone to have such a carefree, optimistic disposition.
hehe, you are the one who's been acting like a child from the very beginning.
witness my magnificence!
ugh. is this what you usually eat? *sigh* seems i'll have to share some of my macaroni with you.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
w--wait, look at the eyes...
ha? we haven't even started fighting yet!
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
i caught some very familiar memories just now -- she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. there was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger...
oh, so that's what happened! thank you, miss black swan.
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
okay, the stove's looking good, and as for the ingredients...
what have you done to him, mister tail?
so... as expected, he's missed the deadline.
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
(fonta's internal reports suggest that they're starting a new trial of an unnamed and unpackaged product. but the product has to undergo a trial because even fonta's own employees have a lot of reservations about it.)
would you still take the same stance? would you still hold the same view of yourself?
i thought it'd be impossible for me to enjoy something like this. i thought i'd never be able to get my mind off my thesis.
well... miss asta, we've made our decision.
the desert's getting colder now that night's falling. and the wind can really sting your face because of all the sand in it.
everyone, just calm down...
i would not try to change her if it wasn't necessary.
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
but this new master... seems like a bad guy to me, don't you think?
still, you needn't worry. he won't escape. you'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
all you need to do, dear spectator, is to witness my performance until the curtains fall.
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
we saw you all chatting over here, and were wondering if we could join in.
paimon, please. "who wrote this book, and why? don't we think there might be a bigger safety risk here?"
oh, your teddy bear? hehe... he's nearly done. here, take a look at him.
it's okay if your questions are a little off. i'll still treat them as real questions from an adviser and answer seriously.
what we saw in the mist weren't hallucinations, but the dragon's memories...
she clearly not a pathstrider of the hunt. but you are, aren't you? tell me, what's acheron's deal?
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
hey! you should really fix that defeatist mentality of yours...
true. none of the clues we've found thus far support the existence of this third person.
you keep looking like there's something you want to say. is there anything you want to tell me?
i'm good, thanks!
of course i do. if he had been in the magic box the whole time, how could he have not heard that sound? why do you ask?
yeah... but he really doesn't seem like a bad guy.
and now that the gods have given me their blessing... it actually feels more like i'm finally able to take my fate in my own hands.
the angler mystery -- the novel! there's a scene that's identical to this footage.
well, if you're not into it, could you at least keep me company...? pleeeease! it's not like we get to celebrate these kinds of festivals every day...
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here... i believe it's about penacony's past.
what about your integrity, huh? you brought the other kids out here to rivet town, didn't you?
you're right... but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
well, in my opinion, sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the order is right.
i have to thank you, mister assistant detective. but... the puzzle this time is pretty strange.
they let you take part!? when did this place last have an inspection!
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
do you think... they're here to welcome us?
since the battle, the shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
hey there! what was with the disappearing act you pulled right as the trial ended?
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
still, i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
if there's any souvenirs anyone still wants to buy, the time is now.
that's an episode of history that i am loath to recall. maybe to you, it seems like my response to these creatures was an excessive one.
and all before i even had a full grasp of the situation... anyway, i just feel a bit bad about how it went down.
now, then... i can't really help her prepare for the thesis defense, so i'll be leaving some notes behind instead. you'll have to give them to her later.
every parent hopes their child will have a happy and carefree life. but if they're overprotective, then all they'll manage to do is keep their child trapped.
i guess we're done...
in other words, even though i can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, i can still send you to where ei is.
i'm sorry... *sigh* i always find myself having to apologize.
okay. well, see you soon, then.
that's what friends are for, bronya! ...you don't sound like yourself. is something wrong?
i mean anyone and everyone who needs your help! by helping others, you'll eventually find your own path. trust me, i have experience in this!
i... i'm not good at this kind of thing! i think it's best if you do it...
admirers... how come we don't get cool nicknames!
what just happened? has the death sentence been carried out?
darn, i wanted to see one...
or... we could go check out some other fun stuff elsewhere. your call!
it's fine. i was the one who brought it up.
the founder of the abyss order, the man who broke the curse of immortality.
from what i've seen, the residents are nearly all miners. it seems like the people here have less than those in the overworld.
in truth, the most important thing isn't what state the world is in now, but what people hope it will become. but of course, i don't mean that as a criticism or a call to action.
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
like madam herta? hmmm, that would make sense. anyway, it's really weird for a xianzhou native to look so old.
some venture in search of the world's secrets to prevent rapidly approaching, yet still unknown, world-shattering catastrophes.
right. we must somehow make her face her problems again...
that can't be. the trolley moves along tracks from start to finish. it couldn't have hit the vase at this distance.
don't worry, we'll listen. please continue.
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
i find it a little strange as well, but we mustn't awaken someone while they're sleepwalking. all we can do is sit here and wait.
what if i end up scaring them and ruining this wonderful feast... that'd be the last thing i want.
hehe, if you find yourself at your wits' end, take it out and see what happens. maybe your prayers will be answered, and all your problems will disappear in the blink of an eye.
eh? wasn't i describing a really happy dream? why are you both looking at me like that... wait, could this be an example of the emotion known as "pity"?
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
ahem...! alright, the welcome ceremony is over. everyone, back to your stations. i will personally treat our guests to some royal hospitality.
regardless of why it's designed like the conductor aboard the astral express, this doll -- is it connected to the case?
an excellent deduction. and the analogy comparing sumeru city to a massive brain? ahh, i love it.
i won't turn that gear... not until you're ready.
well, i'm not a member of the club at all. clorinde simply woke me up first thing this morning, said there was a good script worth experiencing, and asked if i wanted in.
we're back here again. aventurine actually chose a really conspicuous location...
the pieces look like they flew to both sides of the room.
don't take any of what i just said seriously! how could i possibly let fontaine fall to the whims of trivial prophecy?
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
i... i'm a lawful resident... at least now i am...
what does director topaz think about us having to take on her support squad?
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
(hey! that's not the right thing to say... you managed to stir up this guy's sense of pride)
but as a warrior, i look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
hmm, let me see... our next stop should be the cloudford victory zone!
(book circulation is strictly regulated and there is a log of anyone who checks out a book.)
the traveler is right. you once investigated that underwater sinthe base, and recovered items belonging to the victims.
you two have my thanks. you have done much for me, and i will never forget it.
perfect -- in that case, we'll swap out some of the decorative plants for some of misess bernette's flowers...
so, what would make more sense from his perspective would be to turn his back on the order, and seek protection from my father.
alright then, let's meet up here tomorrow. i really hope the seelie replies.
how did you know that was perkins...
we are not that different. and right now, we share a common enemy. we should not let our differences get in the way.
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
please never do that again...
seriously? can't you just tell all of us?
no, you're right. i can't do anything in this situation. i'll leave this to you.
even if i don't want to believe it, i'm starting to see how things could all tie back to uncle marcel.
the palais is right up ahead. come on.
wait... no way...
...whoa, the words on the note are changing!
i take no pleasure in saying this, but... it seems as if the doctor had no intention of welcoming back a loser, so...
ah, boss, see these two faces here? remember them. they're the ones picking up the bill later.
(yeah... looking back on it now as an adult, i can hardly believe how patient and kind everyone was.)
ohh~ is seele starting to appreciate our strength? hmm?
the incense i smelled earlier seemed familiar... thinking back on it, i'm almost certain it was the scent of spirit borneol.
and all the while, i played my part to perfection to convince them that was true...
in her arms she was carrying a little fox on the brink of death. she knelt before kitsune saiguu and begged her to save her friend.
someone's not in the best of moods... let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
yeah, you didn't think the future of belobog was at stake, right?
there's no one willing to help her here, so i have to step in.
i suppose any progress is a step in the right direction. let's go.
it's filled with pure elemental power that is quite similar to mine, but yet it's also a little different...
i was waiting for you to say that.
ready? lights, kamera, action!
what? a critical success? your luck is through the roof today....
if we had a little more time, i could have even convinced her i was xipe the harmony.
*yawn* it must have slipped my mind when i dozed off. i haven't had a nap today yet, have i?
i'm guessing not yet, but distrusting me would make perfect sense if they ever paid attention to the urban legends about me.
can you see that building in the distance? that's the famous grand theater, another great landmark of penacony!
that's... probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
in your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
(is this situation salvageable at all?)
yes... sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
however, her unpredictable and varying sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so i have to make every second count.
(i doubt they'd ask about something so irrelevant!)
haha, i'm just hoping for the best! you're the one jinxing us!
state your query. to the point.
yeah! grand champs in the house!
of course. i can relate to how it's feeling.
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
perhaps the immense power we released was the pouring out of all these irreplaceable emotions that had built up over time.
#a curse of immortality was laid upon him, to forever wander the wilderness... while he watched the people he was supposed to protect turn into {f#the monsters}{m#monsters} of the abyss.
finally, i can breathe a sigh of relief.
sounds like you're speaking from experience...
...what's going on? why is it... getting hot in the memoria?
i may not have the evidence with me, but i know where i could go to collect it. if we look up the deserted clothes against a record of people who went missing at around the same time...
i only lost because i was duped by her little tricks.
some people work hard all day so that their families can have a hot meal on the table at night.
...how come you just jumped out on your own, little fella? isn't your module thingy broken?
this isn't just about me, and it never has been...
just kidding, how could that be possible?
i feel not just nervous, but curious as well.
and what do you know, miss furina was standing right there all red in the face. she practically sprinted back down the mountain the minute she saw us...
is this what they've become after experiencing the apocalypse?
...it sounds dangerous, but what i want you to do is actually very simple. investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out what exactly they're up to.
that makes sense to me... monsieur neuvillette, i would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
...if so, i'm not sure "mighty" is the right word for these architects.
we were just talking about her, as it happens. little layla told me that haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. but after you met layla, she very abruptly left.
beelzebul is ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. baal's name was "makoto."
...hey sleepyhead, looks like you're awake.
we tried to pretend like we never heard anything, but you nearly let it slip that one time, hahaha...
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
ah!!! you scared me... why'd you wake up so suddenly?
oh, there was a girl and her brother who said you saved their lives. you might want to check on them and see how they're doing.
ah, the permanence's descendant... what a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
i don't know the details. she said she wanted to rest, and i have nothing pressing that requires her attention. so there is no reason to disturb her.
...the stage is set, this is our moment.
...just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
if not for that interlude, this would have been an astonishing trick. i probably never would have figured out how you pulled it off...
...for example, "woof woof, woof woof woof woof!"
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless...
well then, does that answer all your questions?
as a guuji, there's one thing i know very well: people believe whatever they want to believe. some things you do not see, simply because you do not wish to look.
uh... is this right?
seems like this one's got a temper...
little one, the pairings for the remaining thirty-two are out.
let's go! just think of it as a nice little hike to the top of the mountain.
i followed kitsune saiguu around the mikawa flower festival one year and saw her play akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura.
quiet on set! places, everyone! lights, kamera, action!
mister giovanni, have you been deliberately guiding us towards a certain goal?
hmm... well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, i wouldn't say no.
i didn't mean you had to be so formal about it. i need your actions, not your words, hehe.
even among the fools i know, miss sparkle's sense of humor stands out from the rest.
there's no need to think like that, and no need to keep addressing me as "lady." just "furina" is fine.
that should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
is he... connected to that past you want to escape?
the monster smiled, led the fox toward the fire... and murdered it. the gray fox's heart was turned into a beautiful drop of water, clear, spotless, and pure.
*sigh* it was just an analogy... an analogy, okay?
anyway, just follow me. i'll save the story for when we get there.
your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe... and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
yeah! it can't heal if we take out the source, right?
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details... well that's reassuring.
the next contest is starting soon -- let's go to the prep zone.
as a fox envoy, i have an excellent memory. i recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
heh, thanks, i hope so~
o--okay. well, in short, it means that the results derived from astrology are prone to change...
jokes? um, i... don't really have a good sense of humor...
next time, maybe ease off on the surprises?
two large pots of it, in fact -- it was good tea, though.
...but, if it's a conversation you want, you'll have to defeat me first.
i'll tell the aranara in advance. once they hear the whole story, i'm sure they'll be willing to help.
ah. you're saying that he wasn't...
there's still some time before the next part of the script unfolds. let me stay a little longer in this body.
although, calling herself the "protector of order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law...
by the way, in those immersia stories, the swordmasters always hide their true strength before a decisive battle.
i want to watch them blossom and wither, see them refined on the page, retold on the stage, and remembered long into the future.
oh, that's a good idea. a cup of coffee might help clear my head. let's go.
anyway, it looks like you're going somewhere. why don't you take me with you?
so it can only mean... that you are happy to see me again. you have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
but upon his return, in cruel avarice, lyney desired sole credit and prepared to do away with his partner-in-crime.
memory recovery is going well, but slowly. she'll be here soon, and time is short.... there's nobody else here, so there's no need to be delicate... in fact i think i'd better go all out....
the venue is right over there. why not go and take a walk around? oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.
hey there, ludivine? how's business lately?
...don't be greedy, harbinger of snezhnaya.
but you still didn't give up, did you? because of amun... al-ahmar.
he looks beyond saving.
neverwinter workshop... hey! didn't gepard say there'd be a show here?
we thought chief amadhiah forgot about the missing villager, but it turns out we're at a moment in time before the village issued the commission.
a day isn't that long. let's see what kind of case this big-shot outlander can build in such a short amount of time. hehehe, i'm really quite looking forward to hearing it.
but this place doesn't seem like it could have been constructed by the akademiya alone...
ugh, no no no... i gotta stop worrying so much about everything! the whole point of me taking a vacation was to come here and relax.
ah! looks like it's about to start. let's make our way over to the arena!
florent should be nearby, and we should be able to find thierry and uncle marcel in the city.
people try to avoid pain and stay in their perceived bubbles of safety out of an instinct to protect themselves. this is human nature, but it is also one of their weaknesses.
or get him to hand over his memory bank. we could go through it ourselves.
do you have to make it sound all scary...?
you're up next, little one. come on, sit yourself down here.
...you gonna be this enthusiastic when it's jail-sentencing time?
...just as expected.
but now, it is clear that the clothes were proof that there was a third person at the scene, and that they were turned into water after committing the murder.
after we end the sabzeruz festival samsara, we have to look into them...
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality... i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
the planet of festivities itself... is a stellaron disaster?
if it's a gunfire trial... we should be able to settle it with a fight, right? i hope this won't waste too much of our time.
whoa! don't sneak up on me like that!
at least from our perspective, my father had no reason to kill, so he would also have no reason to bring an extra gun with him.
hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. i'm really glad i decided to come to qiaoying village.
yawning without covering your mouth? uncouth. i will pardon your rudeness this time. good morning to you, too.
selfie, selfie... you're right. i've been here so many times. why didn't i think of taking a photo?
all kinds of essential oils commonly found in alchemical products can temporarily increase elemental affinity... but, it would be difficult to force someone to use them without knowing it.
according to jacques' family members, he already told them that he had been discovered and that he had no choice before he left home that day.
look! that's the statue of clockie, penacony's famous cartoon character!
huh? which next fight?
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
got it. but... it sounds like mister assistant detective has his own misgivings... would you like to go over it again?
even though i try to fall asleep, i can't get the championship out of my head... and before i know it, it's morning again.
all those obstacles we overcame side by side... feels like it was just yesterday! don't be a stranger, now, partner!
hehe. you are the most important part of the plan. i know what i'm doing. you don't think i'd leave you with no chance to win at all, do you?
this road... are we heading back to the oti mall?
these are all... charred remains?
what!? then go find a workshop to get them repaired right away! oh, and you too, bonnot. go find our spare kamera in the warehouse, and bring it back to the set!
when i clasped musou isshin in my hands, i had the feeling that she was by my side once again.
are you yinshu, the shopkeeper at spare time book shop? there's something we want to talk to you about.
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
it has to be nearby! let me go take a peek with my sharp eyes.
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
you guessed correctly... the top-ranked fatui harbingers, up to no. three, possess power comparable to that of gods. i was no match for him in that kind of situation.
...no, in fact, i should say, she's hiding everything from us.
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there...)
...i think i offended someone again.
now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
if it's not me, then why does she look exactly like me? and if she is me, then... who am i?
then finally, the oratrice will be consulted by officials. the result it returns is the will of "justice" itself.
my help, hmm? well, maybe you're forgetting that i'm no longer the mighty hydro archon. i don't even have a vision, you know.
got it. i hope my answers were satisfactory, seekers of knowledge.
she no longer needs the power of the gnosis, and in any case, she tells me she has severed ties with celestia.
the disaster in inazuma caused me great concern. i felt that i had to step in before it was too late, otherwise it would spread to all of teyvat.
i'm not sure we can give him the answer he would hope for.
yeah, yeah, you're in the footnote somewhere~
so no matter how strange or spooky things might look on the surface, maybe all they point to in the end is a small and simple secret.
oh, and in other news, i also took clorinde out for a meal.
i'm sure everyone longs for that one thing in life that seems trivial to others, but they themselves can never obtain.
goodness, i presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
ah, sorry, i'll take the little ones away right now.
ah, i get it now... so the void of elemental power was left behind from when the forbidden knowledge was purged.
it's very likely that it's connected to my foggy memory, but i can't figure out what it is.
what happened to the grand theater stage?
i want to travel across this vast land with you, experience everything you enjoy, and do all the things you do.
oh, don't worry, i've got everything i need here, no complaints at all.
uh... you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence...
but as spina di rosula's adviser, his work mostly deals with personnel and security, so he shouldn't have much means when it comes to finances.
if there were scales, with all the people of fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other... is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
blonde, tall, good-looking... *sigh* those landau genes sure are something else.
*sigh* my mind is completely blank... i need to get out and unwind.
it's an honor to learn from you, master yanqing!
well, what's your opinion? i must admit that she can be interesting at times, but liking her doesn't mean that i'll blindly agree with her.
darn, this guy's not stupid...
not much. as before, i can see the way forward, yet there are still contradictions.
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. so traveler, did the new clues yesterday help you gain a new understanding of the situation?
the stage is already set, so there's no reason to disappoint the audience. let's see this trial through to the very end!
allow me to introduce him to you: this is boothill, a galaxy ranger.
i know what you're thinking, but alas... that girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
could you please get off my case!? i don't know what's gotten into you today. i'm making an effort here, you could at least try to do the same.
it is... relying solely on what the seelie said might not be viable.
agh! is that a grenade? what's that on the side... huh? it's lipstick...
these memory fragments are as fine as dust, and can't form memory bubbles. they're hard to see with the naked eye -- even most memokeepers can't sense them.
more curious than my appearance is the fact that she and i don't see each other anymore, wouldn't you say?
what!? hold on, are you serious? i thought you'd be against it for sure!
please give the knowledge stored in this to the matra, and ask them to import it into beynuni's brain.
if so, then you underestimate me. i am quite well-informed about the vision hunt decree.
the wind that blows from afar carries fresh life to these shores...
the most suspicious part is that no matter how much i ask, no one's ever willing to tell me anything about it... and that's where you might be able to help.
it would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
eversummer... was that always the name? seems i was too young to get the irony back then.
hey, come back! we want to ask you something!
how can i wake up a person who's already awake?
what's with you and always copying the way i talk!
i was only joking, hook. junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. but you must make one promise to me...
by the way, do you know that clockie's design is said to be inspired by none other than the legendary watchmaker?
however... even then, focalors will still make herself present at just about every trial. it seems that she just likes to immerse herself in that sort of atmosphere.
i cannot. in my current state, even if i went out, i could do nothing.
ah, i have a feeling that our adaption will be even better than the original story!
haha, it's no pity at all. it was just a little fun competition.
it's kinda hard to explain...
you're right, but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
(from there, we should be able to predict its movement. alright, let's give it a try.)
i owe you a big one! if it hadn't been for you, i might have been... taken away by them.
isn't that a bit unnecessary?
the water levels here are unstable and there's a chance the water will rise... so staying here wouldn't be safe either.
i was distracted and... accidentally stepped on an avidya leopard's tail.
sure, i haven't done that in ages. let's go!
life is not just about yourself. each and every one of your actions shapes you and the world around you.
as a mark of my gratitude, i will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
that uniform... was it him that texted you?
i believe that she's one of the best, even in a place like the akademiya, where geniuses come by the handful.
wow, miss topaz, you're really young for an ipc executive! that's impressive!
i find it hard to trust anything you've just said...
sorry, i can't answer that question. that ranger is shrouded in mystery. i'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
and that photo wall filled with the express crew's happy memories -- it's obvious that miss march loves keeping records of her life.
colter mentioned my parents, as well as melus and silver. it's all thanks to them that i've made it this far in life.
then again, i suppose your frankness is part of your charm.
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
go on, twirly-whirly. be a good fungus now, and do everything that haniyyah says...
before you begin resting, there is one last thing i would like to know.
i didn't mean for you guys to start beating yourselves up over it!
mister oleg, out of all the people we know in belobog, you have the most life experience. what do you think we should do?
wait, you guys went sightseeing in another town?
this body is an assistant to the one within. but it is also the guardian of the rules.
go see for yourself. witness everything with your own eyes, and when this is all over, tell me what you feel about it.
yes. the true raiden shogun, who meditates endlessly in the plane of euthymia to preserve her being...
ugh, so i'm a criminal, huh? forget sampo, wait until i get my hands on you!
hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
because kaveh, as the successor of this research, does not wish to see these ideas disseminated, i will seal it up.
hehe. oh, we have reason to put you on trial. it's obvious, isn't it?
i hope we can work together to uncover the truth, and end this case once and for all.
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist... it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
ahem... don't you guys need to hide your identities?
i see... we'll go look for them, then.
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
"a name is life's first gift." you didn't say it out loud, but i know that's what you're thinking.
i'm going to be the start of something new.
stop! don't you dare insult xianzhou swordplay like that! if you have the guts, i'll show your mechs what i can do!
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide... this kind of work was made for him.
well... okay, okay. you want something that can pass on messages, right? give me some time, and take care of dunyarzad for me.
...but those are in opposite directions! how about... we go check our own rooms?
...this is not good. everyone, we must hurry.
now then, my good, noble chief justice, should we not, in your view move--
that's right... we're still waiting for mister giovanni's mysterious elite player to show herself.
i'm here to see marcel. could you please let him know? you can just say navia is looking for him.
as the cream melts on the tip of my tongue, all my stress fades away.
it's getting late. why don't we rest here for a while? i'll tell you some interesting astrology stuff when the stars come out.
no. quite the opposite, in fact.
it's alright, monsieur neuvillette. given their confidence, i expect they've found the crucial evidence.
since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? i'll need your help with the ritual.
i think they call that "complaining from the heart."
this world is full of unsolved mysteries...
i apologize for all the ways in which i tested you previously. we've never worked with the fatui before, and it's extremely important for us to know who we're working with.
you're back. i've been waiting forever for you two. judging by the looks on your faces...
hmm, that "place downstream" could be somewhere close by.
whoa! why are you here!? ...and how did you get here before us?
you should stay here, little layla. i understand that you want to help haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. leave it to them this time.
well, that's it for snack time. i'm going to have another look around the area.
(the angler is both a detective and a fighter!)
well, poisson is where spina di rosula began, after all. it's our main base, our home.
why did she go to khaenri'ah first, and not i? why did she keep me in the dark about it? was it to shield me?
thank you so much, masters. oh, wait, does this mean our training is only officially starting right now?
no, the prototype was merely a proof of concept. its appearance and intellect were not based on ei. it was a test.
the future of sumeru city will be in my hands alone. i will shut down the akasha and let curiosity and the thirst for knowledge drive the realm of academics once again...
let's talk about something else. like... what are your future plans?
good. then i'm free to alter the script as i see fit?
elio can see his own future, and i can also "see" mine. he says that there is only one kind of destiny, but before i reach mine, i want to know what else i can do... this is my right.
the people's sacrifice has always caused me immense pain, but in dwelling on the tragedy, i overlooked their splendor... the grief blinded me to how brightly they shone in their final moments.
unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. with his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together... we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
right on! but you can say whatever you like -- a good adventure shouldn't be full of rules and regulations!
"...i've entered another space... before me are flowing sandstone and howling fish... impossible and surreal sights..."
but in any case, it sounds like the issue has already been resolved?
speaking of investigations, which problem should we tackle first? monsters, or evil sorcerer?
alright, why don't you wait for me at the restaurant? i'll go do some prep, and i'll get someone to tidy up your room while i'm at it.
they may be tiny, but when they go buzzing right by your ear in the dead of the night... bzzt! ugh, it's so annoying.
oh? surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
the guest rooms are charmingly minimalist...
it can't be helped. perhaps in their eyes, humans are like fierce "monsters" as well.
i'm quite curious. you already have more than enough resources to last a lifetime, so why do you keep bringing everything with you?
so, are we to just abandon the notion of progress... for the sake of wishful thinking?
i've lost... if i can't even handle this kind of training, there's no way i'll beat skott...
if a mother bird lets her baby ride on her wings for too long, her child will never learn how to fly. perhaps the goddess of prophecy has always known that one day... she'll have to let go.
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
i imagine that an item as delicious as this dango milk must sell exceptionally well, no?
that's the spirit! strike while the iron is hot!
sounds just like lyney's case, doesn't it? in both cases the culprit seemed obvious, but neither appeared to have any motive at all.
ugh, i know, i know... sorry.
hmm... memokeepers should probably think of a better way to show up.
your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. something that shines in unison with fate itself.
oh, right... i nearly forgot.
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though...
to put it simply, it's as if you've mistaken a pyro crystalfly for a firefly in the night. you lost sight of its true nature because you focused too much on your perception that it glows.
they must be... erebus? strange, i didn't notice when i sewed them on...
although i've built up a certain following within fontaine, it is no reflection of strength or wisdom.
what do you think? any idea what the correct order is?
that's also why i love observing humans and all the things that happen to them. it all brings me great satisfaction.
for your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
honestly, when i heard the conductor's request, i was pretty surprised.
wait, no, no, no. i'll definitely lose...
nobody wants to risk failing their exams, you know.
don't worry, mister yang.
speaking of solutions... are they repairing that giant robot -- the one we fought against? i remember you took control of it and helped us defeat cocolia!
(the water from the primordial sea should already have been prepped before halsey entered the magic box.)
by making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too... and, who is that over there?
i understand. let's do this.
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
really? i thought she was pretty icy...
his thinking is very spontaneous... is this typical of artists?
i'm really sorry for waiting until now to tell you everything.
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
i'm sorry. for certain reasons, there are things i can't reveal to you yet. but there are also things you should know.
because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor...
i always told them that they didn't have to protect me... to think that they'd keep doing so even after death...
if you want its help, all you have to do is write down your question, and you'll get a response a short while later.
(have i... reached my limit? no, perhaps i reached it long ago. today, i didn't even notice my own tears.)
hmm? what do you mean "no snacks"? of course we'll have snacks! if we cannot buy some, then we'll simply make some.
next, find a suitable spot... and try *walking up* the wall.
this world might be a lot more complicated than we thought.
(it seems to be anxious. let's follow it and see where it leads.)
sailors? can origami birds be sailors...?
looks like we'll have to play this little game of sparkle's then.
many members of the spina have visited in the past, too.
but i don't quite understand -- why would you say that your homeland is a dragon?
and when we were in dreamflux reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the crew... had ever talked with clockie.
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me...
how could a person ever be transformed into water? this is reality we're talking about here, not some magic trick!
i'm super interested in xianzhou immersia and novels! even though i use a bow, almost all the great heroes in those immersia use swords, so i want to be a swordmaster too!
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
next time, i think i should be the one trailblazing with you guys -- welt can stay on the express.
besides, i'm also doing this for myself. i need something -- a distraction -- to keep my mind off melus and silver.
i've experienced that pain in your consciousness. it must've been a horrible experience.
so warm...
workshop? i'm not too sure about that... let's see if we have other options.
uhh... anyway, let's not talk about that anymore! i'm going to go on ahead. don't fall too far behind, now!
changing the world, changing the past, changing the fates of other people... these are not simple things to accomplish.
i am gradually getting used to this... who knows, i might even be able to perform some high-level moves with hanu.
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract... goes against everything the nameless are about.
papa probably didn't know, either. i know he sent a few people to investigate the matter in secret, but... they never found any credible leads.
people in the underworld have gotten used to making the best of a bad situation. that's why i have to keep reminding myself that we're nowhere near where we need to be.
but reminiscing about the carefree life of being a kid sure works wonders for the mind...
elio only gave me one instruction: allow the astral express to pursue the grand legacy. it means that the watchmaker's legacy holds great significance to trailblazing, and to you.
furina... you don't have to shoulder this burden alone.
himeko... i still don't get it. why were you so sure that misha had a connection with this dream bubble?
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...
coincidentally, marcel attended both the banquet and the trial.
haha... sometimes you just have to laugh at the absurdity of it all.
but now we have a chance to find the answer to this mystery.
it sounds... like a flawless theory...
everyone rose to their responsibilities. and i finally regained my freedom...
geez... i can barely even hear myself think!
have you not sensed it yet? this apparent land of dreams... it's a carefully designed dream maintained by the family through unknown means.
so why don't we take a page out of her book and protect her dreams with a well-intentioned "lie"?
aventurine? is he still alive...? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
why are you still here? go find dan heng! exciting adventures are waiting for us.
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
whew, i think i might've overexerted myself though... i'm flagging hard. let's go see miss yae before i crash ...
i'm not sure what it means either. it sounds like some kind of old fable.
perhaps, judging from the outcome... this is that person's true intention.
we rescued him from the snow out of the kindness of our hearts. we had no idea he might be using us to get past you! are you really dumb enough to fall for his...
and what about these gardemeks? i thought only those associated with the maison gardiennage could control them.
this is a big town. where should we start?
hey, these shiny things... are these light cones? i thought only the interastral peace corporation had rare stuff like this.
yet, you have endured.
that's right. did you hear that? repeat after me: dream-- flux-- reef.
did he... succeed?
alright, thank you. we'll go look for her.
it wouldn't have come to this if we were able to cure them earlier...
after the duel, though... there was a period of time where we simply didn't know how to face each other. she entrusted this sword to me, and never came back.
"the person present who shouldn't be..." who could that be?
well, you should really be thanking sampo. if it weren't for his intel, we wouldn't have made it in time.
don't mind me, though. this is just my way of learning.
it's the title page of the angler mystery!
ah, you see... her emotions are incredibly unstable. she's constantly doubting herself.
oh? such a hasty refusal. do you think that's wise? goodness, who knows what tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it...
but i want to help, i can't just sit back and watch you while you fight. don't worry, i can handle myself.
i also have you to thank. the things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
okay, let's start by looking at the hint it left us. it should be on the second page.
see? they've got great discipline, too.
this doesn't feel very "me." is this okay?
well, there goes all our plans...
so, even the mighty stellaron hunter is willing to admit defeat, huh...
okay! rest up -- you're not allowed to miss the next trailblaze expedition!
the path sure had some twists and turns, but it turns out that this place isn't actually that big.
just now? we used the power of two gnoses to successfully connect with the irminsul consciousness from five hundred years ago...
as her erstwhile closest friend... ei handed it over to me, and i've kept it in the grand narukami shrine ever since.
...yes, every celebration must come to an end.
so that's why you went for maintenance, way to go serval! i thought you just came up with it on the spot.
r--really?
and ultimately, her eternity is defined by fear... the fear of loss.
the boss of the moles should stick to her word. i have patients to take care of, see you later.
...heh, you truly have changed. i suppose this is what humans call "growth."
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
got it! when in rome, as they say! don't worry, conductor, we definitely won't embarrass the nameless.
...wow, that's a pretty convincing argument...
hey, what are you doing! you can't just throw trash... no way! the words on the note are changing!
only rules shall remain constant for eternity.
and i want to live up to their expectations. i don't want them to regret putting my name down.
aside from that, i have to say the family has been really accommodating...
in your eyes, the value of a human life is nothing compared to those cold laws you hold so dear.
she might feel like everything she's ever worked for is pointless, and that could lead to some demoralizing thoughts.
okay, so... with what you know so far, what do you think the truth is?
ah, good show today, both of you. it was so much fun to watch.
yikes! so serious! i was just curious.
come on, start praying with me! ! please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
hmph. then i will come again once your preparation is complete. i have time.
well... in fact, i myself am competing in the tournament.
dunyarzad, the suffering you endured during your illness is also proof of you being with me and praying for me. thank you.
the good news is that the chaos seems to have subsided.
come on, i've told you my story -- now it's your turn. shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
but an excess of caution is not unwarranted in this case.
you are not the only ones to be disappointed in me. i, too, am exceedingly disappointed in myself.
as for me, i've somehow become the apprentice to two cloud knight swordmasters, and i've been honing my sword skills with their guidance.
this puppet isn't responding at all... did something go wrong?
in that case... let's make our way to the end.
thank you for protecting the clementine line.
yes, but the enemy was very cunning, so he could never get anything out of the dealers, all of whom only sold the stuff and weren't privy to the rest of the operation.
perhaps the criminal thought that since she was chosen from the crowd, she would be too easy to identify if she was still wearing the same clothes...
well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. i'm natasha -- a doctor in the underground. you've already spent a day in my clinic.
exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
so you're actually... one of those types that's cold on the outside but pretty thoughtful on the inside, huh? that reminds me of silver, one of my guys...
there are a lot of mountainous roads in this area. i imagine they'll be even harder to navigate after dark.
infiltrating the house of daena was a total accident. she'd forgotten an important book, and the house of daena happened to be closed at the time. there were only days before the paper was due.
but you are miserable, because you don't have a life of your own...
awesome! i've heard that stellaron hunter girl uses this kind of tech -- maybe we can see it in action.
uh... i hope we haven't just jinxed ourselves.
makoto also enjoyed playing akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura when she was alive. hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
okay, take care, and make sure you look after yourself.
when she puts it like that, it actually starts to make sense...
wonderful! in that case, why don't we return to the court of fontaine and head to the hotel debord? i believe we'll make it just in time for dinner.
fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
of course. behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
after the brilliant performance you put on, the reputation of your troupe is sure to spread through fontaine like wildfire. you won't have to disband if you don't want to.
thank you for your thoughts, mister oleg. another vote for the "for" pile.
as he oversaw poisson, my father was compelled to put a stop to sinthe abuse, and called for a complete ban of it.
hehe, trust me. you'll see the beauty of rng!
sorry... i am indeed the worst nameless in the universe.
the memokeeper may be able to teleport the bomb to a deserted location, but... i've found a note inside the doll.
(ayaka's performance was amazing... have i discovered an acting prodigy?)
you and me both! i can't wait to get inside and just flop and roll on that comfy bed...
to be brutally honest... for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
so to me, "fate" is the ultimate knowledge.
ah, we can talk about it later. they're about to wake up.
well met, partner! i knew something great was going to happen when i woke up in such a good mood today.
then i'm on board! thank you for your kindness, general huaiyan.
it'd be pretty awesome if that actually happened.
romeuf and his followers hate the spina and everything to do with callas -- and the aquabus was the source of their contention.
a trial, huh... how exciting. i'll be looking forward to it.
i will leave the tenryou and yashiro commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
but i'm sorry to tell you that based on our investigation, there's some kind of conspiracy behind them.
could you ask oleg how luka's been recently? i haven't seen much of him lately -- it's hard for me to get the full picture.
c'mon, miss yae... let's go help them!
you're right. let's head to the lobby then.
i'm glad that you've accepted our proposal. why don't you choose a new name to celebrate?
you told me... you wanted to find a place in the universe where that one flower was in full bloom.
it's tidy and peaceful here. practically an oasis for insomniacs like me!
(don't forget -- he's modeled after you, mister yang.)
i'm just sharing her pain... the pollution of her consciousness here is severe. there is madness, chaos, and pain all around us.
actually, it's very smart of the traveler to be wary of me right now. after all, the doctor has shown that his technology can apparently even control human minds...
"i disagree with your point of view"... that's what i would say if we were still in the plane of euthymia.
back in the day, at youkai gatherings, once everyone had had plenty to drink, one by one they'd start soaring into the sky with their youkai powers. there were so many of them that their silhouettes would block out the moon.
please, that's how those heroes in the immersia show their respect...
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
i really can't recommend that store highly enough. a couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
the stone slates show the people gathered around the hydro archon in the sea... could that be alluding to the same thing?
*sigh* yes, i'm sorry... you're right. we don't have time to panic.
you used some of those techniques while moving the people of poisson, didn't you? my subordinates mentioned that you even performed some magic for the bawling children.
i heard there's an amazing celebration feast today at the grand bazaar. i wanted to have a look for myself, so i snuck in.
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
and yet five whole days pass before it occurs to you to come and seek help from me. you really expect me not to notice the gaping holes in your story?
alright then. i believe myself to be relatively well-read, but with stories like these, i don't even know where to start...
don't tell me... you thought even i had been blindsided by the oratrice's result?
he's not very proficient in using the akasha's technology, and he spent a lot of jnana energy creating monsters. now the system is out of control.
ah, ahem...! speak your name, guard. why did you lead us here just to betray us?
gifts must have an element of surprise -- just treat it as a part of life!
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
from before the memory loss, before the express...
so i turned you down then by telling you that you'll have to wait until you're older. but this uniform is a promise that you can join us once you're old enough to wear it!
mm-hmm. i've always liked observing all kinds of people, and setaria has always stood out from the crowd.
(and so luocha has to make a break for it! but where to? lemme have a look at the map... aha, gotcha!)
so it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
that's no problem at all. i'll just share all their senses with you once i've possessed them. as long as you're also wearing an akasha terminal, the effect will basically be as if you've possessed them yourself.
it's obvious that our enemy has become more antsy after the secret of the primordial seawater was revealed.
ugh... it's raining again...
the variable is... our arrival! no outsider's set foot in the underground for over a decade...
then let's try regular rods next time. we can have a real fishing competition!
...as you can see, i lack confidence no matter what i do, there's always something worrying me.
e--extermination? in the literal sense?
i've never been great at maintaining relationships. besides, anyone i've ever worked with probably couldn't wait to get rid of me...
look, miss sparkle has given us a puzzle where every single answer is correct.
we can't let it get away! c'mon, you two, let's catch it!
(okay, calm down layla. i know the info's all over the place, but you can definitely do it.)
perhaps he plans on doing so, but i won't.
even if he saw me, he wouldn't know who i am... he didn't notice me during the robbery.
the fourth image... i know this one. this exactly matches the content of the prophecy...
no worries, i hope things go smoothly.
that's enough for now. i'll say this one last time, hook: if you cause any trouble again, i'll take diggertron away. do you understand?
i command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. rest well tonight.
oh, did i mention? ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the grand narukami shrine.
"if you become human... you can reveal your secret to no one. you will face suffering and loneliness. is this truly what you want?"
this might sound strange, but i actually don't know who's been helping me. i don't even know if they're a person or not.
many challenges still lie ahead for inazuma, but i am prepared for them.
but how could i get her to believe that i meant what i said? in the end, i came up with an idea. i'd have a spina uniform made, and give it to her as a gift.
but one by one, all the obstacles are being removed. now is the time to rally the troops.
i know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but penacony is actually in danger right now... we have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
(so luocha hopped on a starskiff and fled with the help of his accomplice... and that, ladies and gents, is the truth behind luocha's disappearance.)
oh? you look fine to me. sorry, i need to prioritize the wounded. there have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days -- many people are injured.
oh, sorry! can you please repeat the question? i didn't hear you clearly just now.
some residents find themselves getting stuck in place and unable to move, others start repeating the same thing over and over again, like they're trapped in some kind of loop.
hmph, i should've known you'd listen to that stellaron hunter. whatever -- but you should think before you do that.
ah, so that's why you're here... tut-tut, yes, that is a tricky situation.
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something...
is everything all right, bronya? i didn't know miss topaz was so... intense. she seemed nice when we met her.
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream...
if what's in here is true, then vache must have built a lab somewhere in the snow plains... and even made progress in his research. but how can that be...
i've heard that there's a long line of people waiting to meet lady furina. i suspect you'll be waiting for quite a while, considering that you missed your chance today.
sounds good to me, too. everyone makes mistakes. what matters is what you do to make up for them.
maybe we can have this conversation again in a few decades, once i've done more for the town and the people.
let's chat somewhere else. how about by the traveler's favorite bench?
be at ease, i'm not here to see commissioner kamisato. actually, i'd prefer to spend this time chatting with the traveler. please, fetch the tea set at your convenience.
come on, lyney and lynette. give it another go. don't worry -- spina di rosula has made the necessary arrangements on your behalf.
i have a bad feeling about all of this... i hope things haven't gotten any worse.
yeah. i'd be lying if i said i wasn't scared of coming back here.
not too long ago, i read a collection of horror stories from liyue. the content was spectacular. in fact, i still feel the need to sleep with the light on even now...
is that it, though? i've always felt that this "doctor" is different from the akademiya sages. he doesn't seem to share their sense of urgency...
oh, sure, that sounds fine to me. just so happens i wanted to check some of the equipment on the boat as well. just find me by the water when you're ready!
and that's how the clash started. now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
...copycatitis still has no cure i see.
lately, i've been so busy dealing with all the fallout from recent events, so i really haven't had any free time...
i'll tell you what i mean by that if the seelie doesn't show up...
well, we're getting ready to fight, aren't we? i feel more comfortable in my regular outfit. hat guy also put away that sword around his waist.
i'll be fine. it brought a few things back, of course. but i've made my decision to move forward.
this is the talisman that i lost, the one that my mother made for me...
how could this happen... miss robin...
...the fateometer? what's that?
look -- down there! it's the ipc!
ah... rain... it's raining.
what's wrong? are you not feeling well?
moreover, according to our understanding and analysis of you, when something like that occurred, you would likely flee the scene and head to poisson by yourself.
someone's full of energy! you... don't look like a xianzh--
i am, in fact, after the watchmaker's legacy, but that doesn't mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. but at least... i hope things won't turn out that way.
you are the one who organized the plans for this release party. in other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. so please, show some confidence.
unfortunately, the remembrance doesn't lie... what we just saw is the "reality" that happened -- and it won't fade from our minds just because we wake up.
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
why do you think she might decide to take back her gift, and stop revealing further prophecies about the future?
doesn't seem like it, everything else is working fine -- see?
i guess that explains everything. you also lost your memories the last two times you tried to leave the city. those days' memories can't be awoken.
gepard should be waiting for us in rivet town, right?
but that's completely unreasonable!
hehehe. it's to thank you.
what are they feeding you kids down here...
five hundred years ago, humanity proved their strength in battle.
um... can you please tell us where she is?
...how about we shove you back in the space station's computer, then?
i'd give it a ninety percent chance.
i'll lend you an extra brain cell.
look, miss himeko: i brought the kid back as promised.
mhm, although maybe there's a part of not wanting to repeat the mistakes of the past. i want to be reasonable, at least.
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
my bow... but himeko made that for me! you're lying...
i never knew that it was so tiring to change forms like that.
yes, although it took us a good deal of effort.
well, he's very good at manipulating the weaknesses of human nature, but perhaps he himself had fallen prisoner to them long ago.
then, what is this regret we feel in our hearts right now...?
hehe... thanks to both of you for understanding.
...we can talk about that another time! right now, i wanna give you a tour of the town... here we go!
you must be tired after the walk back to shore. perhaps i should let you go first?
wait, we're having actual combat training for the first lesson?! isn't that a bit too intense?
i bet the antimatter legion forces never thought they'd be swallowed up by the eternal freeze when they invaded this world.
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
but that can wait... judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
i came here to conduct some astrological observation once. everything went smoothly on the way, and i thought i was starting to get used to life at the akademiya.
their disembodied consciousness is placed inside the collective dream of the sabzeruz festival along with everyone else's, while their now-vacant dreams are harvested by the akasha.
right, yeah, hehe... totally.
and even if that were not so, it could prove problematic if we happened to spread key information about the case ahead of time.
me? hmm... if this was before, i could have simply asked clorinde. but it's already been some time since i last talked to her.
you must be pretty tired, mister giovanni.
wait, seriously? can we do that?
the weather today is perfect for observation. let's see if it shows up.
th--they are? hah, they're just some rabid fans who want to cut the line because they haven't been able to meet me in person, aren't they?
could we have a look around? i think we can come up with some more leads.
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
i don't see the shopkeeper. let's look for her in the area.
oleg and i took vache to the overworld. he made his final request to us: to take him outside the city to the snow plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
i didn't expect that after everything, he would still hesitate to raise his sword against me...
she could think, "maybe i should just leave it all to her. i'm always relying on her anyway. why not let her live my life for me...?"
uh, i appreciate your kindness, but i really can't remember how we met... i'm sorry.
i wonder what silver wolf did to my sword. can i really defeat skott?
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
so tell me. what, specifically, makes this matter so... specific?
after that, though, you started coming over a lot. you loved challenging people to shooting competitions, remember? i don't think many members of the spina ever beat you in one of those.
oh, the weather's terrible. shoot, if i can't see the sky tonight... ugh, i really can't put off my star mapping homework any longer...
your companionship... this is one change that i shall not contest.
you've... met her, right?
hmph, you look ready enough to me. hey... are you messing with me again?
the ground... it's shaking! what's happening!?
yes... looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
but if i didn't use its power on everyone, there's no way of knowing where you could have been sucked into.
you look as miserable as a lavender melon that's been struck by lightning.
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
oh, we're okay, i was just curious about the heater...
come on belobog... don't let me down.
but behind my back, he had been doling out the reagents to residents who were kept in the dark. when it finally struck me that something was wrong, his terrible research had already turned him into... into a madman.
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
(i may be able to come up with a more concrete lead if i keep thinking...)
ah, no... i was just up late last night reading some novels... what does sleeping in have to do with the weather?
most people only pay attention to your tail, but those soft, pointy ears are really just as fascinating.
you must understand the situation you are facing.
so what about forging weapons, cooking, and making condensed resin? they're useful behaviors that benefit you. is that why they've turned into habits as well?
i don't fully understand yet. but my intuition tells me that the reason for everything... it's that seed.
so, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
you're right! let me see, how does this coin work again...?
oh, i see... i--i'm sorry, there are also some blurry segments in my memory as well.
thank you, destiny, for giving us the chance to meet again.
you made a very high bid... the problem is that there are a lot of wealthy people lurking in the underworld.
now, as the one who initiated this cascade of events, shouldn't you pay the corresponding price?
correct. that medicine is a wolf in sheep's clothing -- wildfire has cut off the supply chain.
wait, we still haven't doused the burners!
maybe the seelie didn't prepare anything for us this time? or, does it want us to knock on the door first...
i'm gonna get some rest after i've sorted these photos. don't stay up all night playing video games again!
seventeen rounds of interviews and these are the best people they can find? what a joke.
that makes him even worse! how dare he use a book that praises justice for his evil plans!
should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
...how much trouble have you stirred up exactly on penacony?
let me take a look... mm, so these are the suspects. ahem, hmm, i see...
please, oh please just let me get some sleep tonight... i need it sooo bad!
b--bronya? you're here just in time! things were about to get out of control!
a--actually, i was going to ask... how do you know me, madam faruzan?
cocolia? in order to save belobog, she... i see.
this child didn't have a name. or rather... the balladeer didn't know what to call him. his father died before he could name him.
yeah, don't forget the squealing!
hehe, they are my specialty, after all -- and i see you've already had five of them.
only by achieving victory in this battle can we secure a future for penacony. and only then, my third and final death... won't come true in the most terrible form.
so, what do you think, masters? does this outfit suit me?
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
it's a small device i put together just now. you can think of it as an upgraded akasha terminal.
hahaha, that's alright! i've heard many stories about her from the rest of the spina. they've always said that they were sure we would have gotten along famously.
i heard the xianzhou can tell your fortune -- is that how they do it? anyone can count on their fingers...
...i'm about to duel with skott, but i always feel like my fighting skills haven't improved enough! can i really defeat skott? i'm starting to worry!
the fact that debbi was able to realize that she was dreaming means that she is not very deep in the dream yet.
i didn't even realize it, but you're right. it doesn't seem like there's anything holding me back now.
every species paid a grave price in the fight against forbidden knowledge. this is not a responsibility you should carry on your own.
he certainly has a beautiful tail. although... mine's a little softer.
yes, that's also what we've observed in our investigation.
a very important part of the intel was about this world's descenders... external beings, ones that don't belong to this world.
quick, there's more roots over here!
the akasha's centralized administration of knowledge has always restrained people's curiosity and curtailed the number of paths available to them. i don't think this is good for sumeru.
we have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. well, i say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
...but that is what we're here for! that mastery mark is ours!
whenever i looked at this sword, i couldn't help but wonder... if ms. petronilla had never introduced us to each other at that picnic, maybe part of the sadness i was feeling could have been avoided.
ask away, but i'm afraid i don't know a lot about him myself.
this is just the worst-case scenario. but think about it: if the mastermind behind all this is nearby, why would he let us look around freely? unless...
incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits."
i also pay great attention to the ways of the world... just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
they've been up for a while already. the young guy with the dark hair left first -- he went with sampo.
we're in the dark as of now. since we still don't know anything about their goals, any rash move could tip them off and lead to terrible consequences.
yes, it's all true. i can even show you the memories themselves, if you're willing.
yeah, let me think and see what i can make of it.
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
he's just in an ordinary dream, so it shouldn't be him.
so i told him about the express, and eventually he stopped crying and started asking so many questions.
exactly correct, your honor. i must refresh everyone's memory about that case before i can explain my charge and reasoning.
sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. he didn't say why. still, i'll wager it had something to do with him -- he's always tinkering with his devices.
we don't want a total party kill on the first day, right? with clorinde as the gm, i wouldn't rule out the possibility...
hello again... you know, it suddenly occurred to me that you guys have had to do a lot of running around this time. don't you find it tiring?
and what are you trying to say, monsieur neuvillette?
mm-hmm, you bet! you might not believe this, but we summoned up all our strength, and then...
right, and not only at "a moment of dreams." there may be people like this all across sumeru.
stop! you've gone too far!
that statue... did it just speak?
well now, don't you all look disappointed? don't tell me that your investigation came up empty-handed?
well, ah, i'm afraid even the spina would have trouble looking into that place.
i understand. i shall become your shadow, just as you were once makoto's shadow.
hello, mister gallagher, sir. judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
seems like it wants to show us something. let's follow it.
although i am no longer required to play the role of the hydro archon, the time i spent inhabiting that character has left an indelible mark on me.
i just can't help but... feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
*sigh* being too popular can be such a hassle. who knew the people would adore me so much?
yes, that's it. i'm not making excuses. it's the truth.
hey! what gives!? the audience is still watching me, you know! guards! wait, where are the guards? guards!
we also have some plans to go over, and hopefully we can deepen our bonds as partners... but we'll take that one step at a time, i guess.
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
bronya, did you finish talking to oleg? hope he didn't make things difficult for you.
...might i remind you that i am not here to amuse myself.
...but still, i appreciate your help. i mean it from the bottom of my heart.
but... you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
i, um... uhh...
...i hope you're joking, hehe... that's either an interesting metaphor, or you hit your head.
oh, so it's basically a tea party! sounds great!
whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. did i miss anything big while i was gone?
that lively young lady told me some things about you...
especially those who came in pairs. nine times out of ten, they were here seeking to know their future fate, hoping that it would be a lifetime together.
he thinks he's dead... although when i first fell in, i also thought the same.
the dragon will need to rest for a very long time before it is fully healthy again.
...what now? what are your plans?
this is science! don't get distracted! *deep breath* focus.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
in the animation, he's hanu's partner and one of the founders of dreamville. does that mean the watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with asdana?
...uh, a d--detective's initial conjectures are bound to be wrong! totally expected!
have you... made up your mind, firefly?
naturally, take your time.
yeah! without her, even if we'd defeated svarog, there's no way he'd have given us access to the intel, right?
the memory zone is constantly shifting its form. looks like we'll have to think of a way... to walk on the ceiling.
the rushing water seemed a little odd, almost like the unique color of primordial seawater. some people didn't realize the danger and thought it was just ordinary water leaking from somewhere.
well... how about a conversation?
in my dream, i saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. it bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.
tch... to think you'd use such logic...
are you trying to console me? extend your sympathy? or just express some tendril of regret...
we can get to the rooftop of the opposite building from here, but it requires a device. i remember it's hidden here...
in the end, i passed the admissions exam, and the life i had led came to an abrupt end.
if you hear any juicy gossi-- uh... information, come find me!
this feeling, it's like... like a lemon cheesecake!
but i don't even wanna become an adorable ice cube floating around in space again!
i don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for inazuma...
should i say "it's nice to meet you"?
hey, that's actually a compliment i don't want to hear!
(it's happy because it found some delicious fruit.)
i've already taken some measures to address this. it will take some time to rebuild everything, but no matter if it's culture, friendship, or trust... we will rebuild it.
in fact, i've already had several troupes approach me for the fontinalia film festival. unfortunately, the scripts were all pretty boring, and didn't pique my interest.
she spends all her time alone. having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
so in the vast majority of cases, the one he made tea for was the former electro archon... who was also my sister. raiden makoto.
not bad. i suppose this is a step forward for you. but i'm afraid...
ugh... sorry for crashing your artist party, but we came to talk to you about something else...
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
yeah, but when i finally managed to calm myself down, i noticed that the talisman my mother had made for me was missing.
besides, there's no need to be nervous. this project is destined for success, i feel quite optimistic about it.
(well, i've got nothing better to do anyway. i'll do as she says and see what happens.)
the tombstone that belongs to me once bore the inscription "glamoth's iron cavalry," then it changed to "stellaron hunter," but one day...
my period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. i will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
*sigh* i'd rather deal with monsters than these big shots...
it's a good bow. it couldn't be meant for me... could it?
i know this is a hard decision to make. but have you ever thought about why the goddess might have made things this way in the first place?
would you join us, and play "marechaussee hunter: judgment day"!?
i know every individual word in these books' titles. so why is it that they make no sense to me in these particular combinations?
maybe. but i have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. the future i shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. hmph.
anyway, knowing who i am won't help you get closer to the truth, so you should focus on other things. don't get distracted and miss any clues~
what i take from these stories is not so much the content itself, but what they represent in terms of the effects of time upon inazuma.
ah, it's gepard! is he here to meet us?
i'm sure you've all heard about how i have taken on the role of hydro archon. indeed, i am furina de fontaine, your new archon.
after seeing the letters mister oswell kept for me, i was hoping things might've ended differently. i shouldn't have asked you to come with me to such a dangerous place.
hmm... pretend to be a patient. help me investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
just relax. even if everyone else suspects lyney and lynette, at least we will be supporting them from the stands.
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition...
a--ah, no no no, that's not what i meant...
i had no idea there was still a student inside. i had no choice but to put him to sleep.
...but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
that tinge of regret i sense... ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories i cherish.
if there's anything you want to know, don't hesitate to ask.
(...no, that doesn't seem to be the answer...)
(hmm, there doesn't seem to be any more leads...)
great minds think alike, hmm? i wonder, does that qualify me to, maybe, take the position of shogun for a couple of days?
hmm... i give it a nine point eight!
(this is a familiar feeling... yet, something's a little strange.)
but the seelie wasn't messing with me after all.
legend has it that there were five poets in ancient inazuma who were supremely gifted in singing and writing poetry. they are known as "the five kasen."
well, see you all some other time! toodle-oo!
...to penacony's past, present, future... and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
we didn't have anything to hide in belobog, either...
people write things on headstones, right? let me think...
miss tingyun... is a lord ravager of the antimatter legion!? but-- how can that be?
so, another dunyarzad appeared to replace her in the dream. just like the grass and the trees, that dunyarzad is just a building block of the dream that helps to keep it going.
...just tell her already! we come from a different planet!
even if there's no audience yet, there should be some staff around. why is it so silent...?
you've never really seen us as outsiders, huh.
insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. but what about the long-term?
hehe, that's why i was a bit nervous just now. but luckily, seeing his happy face in the end reassured me that i didn't say anything wrong.
the sun's setting. it's time to wave goodbye and let the creatures of the night take center stage.
this is the interior of the penacony grand theater.
besides, the yae publishing house will need your help with the illustrations again next time, mister calx. you could also consider it as my investment in you.
helping those in need, befriending those worth counting on, and saving the world a few times along the way...
you risked your safety and that of the eye...
it has been forbidden. *sigh* please refrain from making me talk any further.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them...
that way, not only can we get useful intel from her, but she can also use it as an opportunity to redeem herself.
wait a moment. aren't you just proving that i'm a good person?
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination...
can't wait to find out what's inside these victory zones!
me? oh, well, i bought some tea, of course. i just had to try all the varieties recommended in the steambird.
if we want to catch a boat back before dark, we should probably get going.
an entity formed with strong filth would be highly aggressive. but when purified, it presents in the form of a memory.
i never knew there was such a fuss over these tiny figurines... i'm surprised miko never mentioned it to me.
use of force here is strictly forbidden. before you proceed, which of you would like to face criminal charges for dishonoring the shogun, hmm?
huh? there's a note here too. "take your fancy? there's a reward inside~"
no, wait! just a second!
haha, i can't deny that my hobbies had no part to play in this. however, regardless of whether it's light novels or a festival, catching people's attention with a fresh concept is the essence here.
did she herself commit that sin? and if not, why would she be in such a posture...?
you want to go back? unfortunately, human consciousness always gravitates toward reality. now that you've seen the flaw in the dream, there is no turning back.
but as long as you can still wake up, you can still move forward with your life.
...miss topaz! i never thought i'd run into you on penacony.
i... i'm not beating myself up. all i did was to rationally observe the distance between myself and a real archon.
those dreamscapes kept vanishing, but as soon as that beep sounded, more new spaces appeared.
it's funny... the moment i boarded the cable car, my mind was filled with everything i wanted to do on the surface...
two paths lost their aeons in that war -- the propagation and the order. coincidentally, their downfall is related to a certain aeon...
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
that's righ-- hey! this is supposed to be a happy moment!
also, does miss topaz even approve of your so-called "support squad"?
i remember you mentioned that the eremites in port ormos are all making a fuss about the upcoming resurrection of king deshret.
i still don't know anything about the blessing from the stars. will it never happen again since i don't need its help anymore?
who could it be...? going to all this effort just to meet us?
anyway. i'm only telling you this to stop you worrying, so that you can focus... on something i need you to do for me.
i said... why not?
we're not done with you yet!
in the dark of shadow, our heroes seek to find, where creatures born of evil, weave their grand design.
why don't you take a final trip to the bathroom before bed?
i will continue investigating no matter what. we will bring the truth to light. that's... my father's true last wish.
so whenever they "wake up" in this dream of the sabzeruz festival, they don't remember anything from their previous, identical dream.
hehehe... i wish you the best of luck. may you soon discover the truth behind it all.
let's do it! time to end the mystery once and for all!
if it wasn't for acheron's plan, we might have been trapped in this dream forever.
now for step three: yank out that anxiety and cast it away with all your might!
...perhaps. but the act of shouting was very meaningful indeed!
hehe. come now ayato, we're not strangers here. there's no need to sound so formal.
oooo! all those benefits that the general promised -- they're finally here! yippee!
thank you for everything you've told me. i will definitely find the truth. the current state of things is not something i'm willing to just sit back and accept.
i can see that... hmm, maybe i should try to learn some magic. if i could make things disappear, cleaning my room would be a cinch!
are you... a knight of beauty?
but if we were to change the siblings to two sisters of a similar age... then that aspect of the story might come through more clearly.
sure, but instead of diving into story time, let's talk about what's troubling you.
creating such an intricate mechanism out of a glaze lily... setting up the spirit borneol in advance... and arranging for sylvain and lucien to stay at the hotel...
like when a server at a tavern brings a plate to you, you'd naturally assume that food is on it.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
yeah, it might be better to keep a low profile. as long as we're helping people, it doesn't matter who we are or what we're called.
just thinking about it makes me wanna pass out...
think carefully. you of all people should know what really happened to them.
so... you think svarog's logic has a hole in it?
mister giovanni? seems like my hunch was right all along...
can't believe you're in the mood to crack jokes...
this is so her style, isn't it?
not only does she not fit your description, but she voluntarily gave up her gnosis long ago, severing her ties with celestia in the process.
this dream has the ability to create imaginary people, which is why people are so unwilling to wake up.
we can finally wrap up this whole thing...
whew, i'm getting sleepy myself. see you tomorrow. remember to wake me up on time...
there's no other grand theater in the dreamscape.
after seeing the city, a thought popped into my head: "am i really worthy of this place?"
when i was young, i often thought that i could do whatever i wanted, because there'd always be someone there to clean up after me.
huh... i really didn't expect the people in the city to keep us at arm's length like that. i totally thought the hunters would be treated like heroes.
...i still feel that mister mikhail must have really wanted to witness this day himself.
again... i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
ah! what a two-faced hag!
my dear citizens, my loyal audience, allow me to present my reasoning and bring this performance to a swift close.
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns...?
was i not the closest person to him? and yet, i was the one most kept in the dark.
eh? but... i thought you would be happier to hear the news...?
you can talk to me if you've something on your mind. in this world, there's no one who heals the heart better than a memokeeper.
what kind of trick did they use? when we were tracking them earlier, they looked just like normal xianzhou foxians...
hey, was that the yaoqing general who just dropped in out of nowhere? she's so awesome!
hey, i said over to you! you can't back out now!
we all used to run around in the woods when we were kids. trees and mud was the world we knew best.
people die, and i am no exception. death is like a script, a fate that cannot be defied. but that's exactly why...
now that you know this is all a dream, this answer should hopefully make more sense...
why of course, but now's not the time.
nor does she have any motive. the gardes said that she has never had any dealings with the magic troupe's members.
hehe, then it's a deal.
i accidentally overheard how the express obtains fuel.
i'm just a little curious. isn't it really tiring for miss sparkle to play so many different roles?
mister giovanni, i didn't expect to see you again so soon.
yes, you're right. i'm wary of any and all change, but i do not wish for my pursuit of eternity to stop human lives from changing for the better.
a loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. she is worthy to be called a hero. with an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the kujou clan is assured.
i understand, miss bronya -- no need to explain. your city is facing immense difficulties -- my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.
they're already awake in their rooms. will you be comfortable in following me now? time waits for no one. we must hurry to the lobby.
to be honest, i never understood how he'd achieve that "blizzard immunity." but i do admire that vision and perseverance... i always chose to believe him, ever since i was a kid.
people still use mora in commercial transactions, i assume?
yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
this is my duty. no matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... and no matter how many times we must fight, i will defeat her.
...but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
just like the forest boar that fell in love with a shroom-kin. it changed its own form just to ensure the shroom-kin's survival.
according to the records i was able to access, your sibling suddenly appeared in khaenri'ah...
good thing someone from the eremites heard me shouting for help. they managed to scare off the leopards.
...uh, i wasn't worried about you. if you must know, i was wondering if bronya was okay.
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
do you understand now? i'm afraid this is no paripurna life, but rather...
still doubting what your heart tells you, haniyyah?
huh, what are you doing here? i was just about to look for you at the palais mermonia.
oh, but it's alright if you don't want to listen to that kind of stuff. we can also tell jokes about life... or talk about anything you're interested in.
i apologize. i wish this were a happier reunion... but there are too many suffering with sickness in the underworld. you're the only person i can go to for help.
we can put that discussion aside for now, i'm not here to argue with you. i'm here to charge the true culprit behind the serial disappearances case.
...the story makes sense, every part of it.
...i understand, and i'm okay with that.
yes. so with that in mind, until our investigation is completed, please return to the event and ignore any further temptations from your dreams.
if cocolia threatens us by taking bronya hostage...
twenty years ago, huh... i still remember the gardes leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on neuvillette's desk.
there's nobody else at the scene. seems like miss sparkle used the same method to "send" dreamers back to reality... let's talk to those two there then.
the view here is wonderful. it smells of the rainforest here, and we're far enough away that no one will bother us.
*sigh* no, it's nothing. let's go see the honorable chief justice.
it'll be quite worth the wait. especially yours, i assure you... hehe...
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
i am currently unwilling to deal with any business. i am also incapable of it.
it's not hiding somewhere and spying on me, is it? oh, that's a scary thought...
however, even if i were to lay out the traits of all elemental life-forms, you don't seem to match any of them.
haha, it's a champions' welcome!
eh, it might just be something that runs in my family.
that is true, but my charge here is unrelated to your conduct as an archon.
that's why i could understand them when they tried to resist us and protect the dream.
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
(the contents were probably genius invokation cards...)
it seems like i started to question myself a bit too much. i'll pick myself up again, and become a more reliable president, for all of you.
this kind of event doesn't come around every day -- why shouldn't i dress for the occasion? ...you're not really gonna wear that same old outfit... are you?
well, it's only a matter of time! it pays to be prepared, just like how you should always have an umbrella on hand, even when it's sunny.
now then, i always have my ways. it's just a question of how crafty i need to be...
if i'm lucky, maybe i can convince them to send extra medical supplies to the underworld.
i'll do my best... when i get back, i'll write a letter and send it to the amurta.
yes, they are. they are strong and resilient, and have much to be proud of.
but what your people need from you is not your promises. they want your attention... your divine gaze.
i don't have any friends that i can be frank and honest with, so maybe she's right. you're the closest thing to friends that i have.
i can't always rely on this gizmo to communicate with twirly-whirly. it makes me feel like i'm giving orders...
hehe... now you're following me.
what a smooth talker... though, your eyes do not lie as convincingly as your tongue. you came because you need my help, didn't you?
however, the heavenly principles will awaken... we just don't know when that will be, or what might trigger it.
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
your hypocrisy is built on absolute confidence.
i understand. thanks for your advice.
gallagher... gallagher... where could he be?
miss robin's courage is admirable. and here i was, thinking she was just another superstar celebrity...
...i don't know exactly how to describe it. it's like he's smiling on the outside, but there's no joy inside. only sorrow.
yeah, our goal is the same as yours, serval's, and bronya's -- we just want to preserve this world! there's no reason to turn against each other!
hey, stop joking around!
you intend to travel all over teyvat, and the time has come for the inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
i'll go check it out too! colter, please hold on to this for me!
if you accept that he is you, just as you are you, then yes -- you are evil.
well, i'd say an investigation's in order then! plus, if all else fails, we can just blow it up!
(i'll find out for myself if the rumors are true or not.)
i'm sure she knows it better than i do.
ah! stop talking! if there is someone here, they're in my bad books already.
it belongs to the yashiro commission. a secret unit under kamisato ayato.
would there have been a point? you would've spent the night with new worries, with tomorrow still out of reach.
...still better than just standing there like a scarecrow!
so that's why the fatui were all already in poisson...
another vote for the against pile. thanks for your insight, nat.
hmm, i just hope that doesn't affect your performance today!
compared to the aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of aeons and the paths.
i was also able to become spina di rosula's president, which made me harder to target, as well as giving me more time to grow and learn.
all manner of signs indicate that the prophecy will still come to pass... forget it, that's not something you need to worry about right now.
that's a tough one, alright... there's plenty more besides memories held in the ley lines.
your notion of reality and dream would be thrown into irreversible confusion. i couldn't expose you to that kind of risk.
still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
it's... simulanka durin? and he's looking up at something... a star.
infernal construction what now? how would we know anything about that!
alright, lead the way, little fungus.
however, only fate is about that which has yet to occur, so it has always drawn my curiosity.
aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. but this galaxy ranger... we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
oh? did she look crestfallen and say something melodramatic like "beyond the reach of mere mortals"? then curl up on the ground and start wailing?
but when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
you two, this way. i'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
(no, furina. you shouldn't be selfish...)
i didn't know how to face you because i didn't know what i could possibly bring as a consolation gift.
i wonder what caused them to go down this path, and what they hope to achieve...
so that's how it is... i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
a package? i left a package here...?
we've got your back! we failed to convince topaz, but this should be a piece of cake!
here's my little partner in crime. souka named it "blitzara" -- i think it's rather good. very distinctive.
yes. it's all too clear that both the tenryou and kanjou commissions are in some form of collusion with the fatui. hmph, foolish humans, blinded by their greed.
buuuut it's already getting late... how about we head back to goethe hotel for a bit and then set out on the express tomorrow?
i could at least hold a funeral for my father, and i know where he rests. but as for melus and silver, they're just gone... i just can't...
did he keep some of his power hidden when he was defeated? or... did he achieve something beyond his abilities, and it took everything he had...?
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
perhaps, there's something else we can do?
see? it knows everything.
it was at once a familiar feeling and a strange one... makoto barely wielded a blade in her life, and yet her blade brings me closer to her.
oh, my darling clapper loader and kamera operator! you've both worked really hard.
how are things in poisson now? any better?
anyway. there's a writers' submission event going on at the moment. start by talking to readers and finding out what they're into. when you have an idea of what the current trends are, come back and see me.
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
but what if they... and we... aren't really that special?
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward... he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
i'm sure some people here see the idea of someone coming to poisson dressed as the hydro archon as extremely disrespectful.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
the old and broken weapons...
is... is that how humans feel about it as well?
you're too modest. to that memokeeper girl... salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall was worth much more than that.
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
later on, she was chosen by the sun. the star was given a place in the daytime sky to complement the sun's dazzling light.
why are there seven people all striving to have a relationship with a single male protagonist? is this some sort of narrative device, too?
the exit... is on the other side? how're we going to cross over...
of course. this is all part of our little trip.
though she is a puppet, the shogun has her own consciousness, too. when necessary, she appears here to confront me.
for the sake of the vision hunt decree, of course. don't you think the shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
boring... isn't there anything else more interesting to do?
your present will is not the product of erosion. i shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
(no one entered or left the opera house through its entrances, so where would the criminal have wanted to take halsey?)
why, of course. go ahead, try whatever you like. if the food's good, i'll make a group reservation for the rest of spina di rosula next time.
um... i'm still not sure i understand, but... i'll try. i'll try to do this.
the amount of information in irminsul is vast beyond description. sifting through all of it without knowing what to look for would take too long, even for me.
apples and zaytun peaches were the most popular fruits back then.
those spaces kept disappearing before my eyes, but as soon as that beep sounded, many more spaces materialized.
oleg has always acted on my behalf -- he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the underworld.
everything that you feel is real and lasting, and whatever is missing in you will not be made whole.
no, not this frame. it's the one surrounded by puppets.
since we just woke up, let's stretch a little bit.
if we go by timing, lady furina only emerges in the third image... that means that the person in the second image might be the previous hydro archon.
that tablet recorded the lives of some fascinating people. for example, this marechaussee hunter called "este"...
it's just a minor error. this kind of thing was bound to happen. a small modification to the shogun should fix it.
if your wife were still alive, she certainly wouldn't want to see you like this, would she?
looks like we won... let's hurry up and get to the next stage.
yes. now... who else do you think might be benefiting from the vision hunt decree?
miss topaz, what brings you here? do you also play aetherium wars?
i... admit that you are a born leader. your perspective on humanity brims with pessimism, yet you express equal compassion for all, even when your heart pities them.
i brought gallagher here. it's time... to face the "truth."
but if you were to believe that life is nothing but an empty, ephemeral dream, then that's also the only thing it'll ever become.
really? good job on all that progress. get some good sleep tonight.
i had to keep all my feelings, all my curiosity about life to myself. no-one could be allowed to know...
oh, how cold. i saved your skin, didn't i? surely you could at least humor me by engaging in some small talk first?
what in the world was going on back there?
from my experience observing people, she would undoubtedly regard this as a "brutal" revelation.
additionally, the shogun has no need of recreation. there would be no need for her to come here just to pass the time or to relax.
do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? or... was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
but that's not all... my flowers are watered, laundry's done, even my broken kamera was fixed...
woo hoo! so this is what it feels like to ride a toy train!
to others looking on, this may seem like a pointless endeavor. but for him, the chance to act on his desire to disappear must have meant a lot.
that's right. i'm surprised you understand it so well...
but now, i no longer cling to what was lost. i suppose that means our differences have been reconciled.
hey, that's not fair! my eyes are peeled this time -- i'll make a run for it the second things go wrong.
yes, i agree! as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
so before i came over this time, i took a page from melus' book and decided to make a list of everything. this way, it's easy to see which tasks you haven't checked off.
oh my! well if it isn't my dear partners! how are you all doing?
huh? paimon, did you drink my fonta?
thank you, knight of beauty! we don't have much time left... may we meet again.
uh, did i say something wrong again?
these poor little things stumbling about...
and that's not surprising -- you're different from others. you seem to radiate a confidence most people don't have.
i really love the pluie lotus -- it's such a beautiful color. plus, when you see them in full bloom, it's a sure sign that the rainy season is finally over.
mm... shall we go meet up with them now?
yes. i've been sleeping ever since we parted ways, and i even had a really, really long dream...
that's right! any idea where we can give it a spin?
forget it. even a one-percent chance is enough...
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap... he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
change will come to inazuma, and with it, new possibilities. this will take time, but eventually, the future will bring healing to the scars of the past.
i look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, mister lyney and miss lynette. that's enough for now. toodle-oo~
(i remember now... everything that seemed odd from the very beginning...)
hey, did she just "tch" me?
(wait... so, as long as you pass the check, you can pretty much do anything, and it won't be seen as absurd?)
you're right, this is our best opportunity. alright then, let's do this. i'll stall them at the opera house and charge marcel as the true culprit.
hmm? what's the problem? lots of people in poisson use rods like these.
an inquisition spirit...? on the express?
which is why we sought you out, to help the astral express save the world together.
how it wished to swallow the moon and devour the moonlight. if the world could only return to darkness, then it would finally be peaceful and content.
the thesis i'm working on this time aims to address the remaining triple-orbit problems, as well as eliminate a portion of the methodology's limitations, which will make it easier to use.
thanks to you, the route to the overworld through the furnace core has reopened. i'd like to use it to return to the surface and see if i can get some help.
ugh, it's just been one thing after the other. i've been making non-stop trips between poisson and the court since then...
exactly! you get me, partner.
thanks for the invitation, but right now, i just want to focus on practicing swordplay. masters, let's save the tea for later.
before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
ah, this should be it, right? i'll turn it off -- that should restore the ley lines in the area to normal.
i'm sure this is what the troupe would have hoped to hear as well.
i have much to contemplate in the days to come. but at least i can now see the way ahead.
that was when i saw you. you didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
through her love for her human partner, she was able to find an even greater love -- one that extended to all of humanity. surely the biggest strength of clio's character.
the damage it suffered internally will also slowly begin to heal.
plus, you're the only one with so many friends on the luofu. i'll be lost if you don't come along! you've got to lead the way.
haha, that's how i feel as well. to me, i'm happy as long as i catch some fish.
the fungi have existed for a long time. no one knows what the ecological implications for the rainforest would be if they all got killed off suddenly.
anyway. it sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see ei's less formal side.
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal... tends to leave a deep impression.
yes, that is our destination, but i didn't expect the remaining consciousness of greater lord rukkhadevata to be as polluted as this.
yes, all thanks to you grabbing my drink by mistake.
i'm still the same furina you knew, right? the one that you loved? shouldn't you want to believe in me?
that oleg... he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
yes. any information about the balladeer or the kabukimono in other records will have been changed. but i wrote this story in a way that means, it was left intact.
that's why i want you to help me recover all the wonder medicine. are you willing to take on this assignment?
that was a close call! are you guys alright?
what's this... xianzhou clothing? it's so beautiful!
but sometimes, i'd still look at the clementine line and wonder... would the spina and poisson still be what they are today, had my mother survived?
...what am i going to do with that girl.
right! why waste your time?
thank you so much. please get some good rest, you must be exhausted. you know, take a shower, take a dook-dook... you'll feel as good as new.
...oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something... are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
we just left there. talk about coincidence.
it would be awkward if you got all tongue-tied on stage during the trial.
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
what!? what's that got to do with anything!?
that guy's been staring at us this whole time... hide-and-seek might have to wait -- let's see what he wants.
something feels off... we're in the right place, right?
excuse me, everyone, but i must interject!
then first, we have to restore the sky back to its original state by putting the stars back in their positions. but it looks like we haven't recovered all the lost stars yet.
ooh! i'm the best storyteller -- let me! let me!
*sigh* it feels nice to get tingyun's gifts to the right people.
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
i, navia, king of constellation metropole, give you my blessing! i grant you citizenship to my kingdom!
i came here several times with my father when i was little, but stopped eating here as often after growing up. i hope the food here will be to your tastes.
then, how can i ask inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
hmm? oh. well, i can be the assistant, sure -- or your companion, if you like. i'm really not that fussy.
...it couldn't change the fate of the ones who had died. right?
what an amazing feeling! i've never been on a flying train before!
hehehe... what i mean is, even though i had asked you to solve this puzzle, you two are still the only ones who can see me and sense my presence.
hehe, was it so obvious? i was hoping you would actually take one of those commissions. that kind of chance to observe humans doesn't come by often...
huh! in the sewers!? is the film still okay?
yes, but it seems that the danger isn't enough to stop him from longing for his wife.
if i am not mistaken, what we just saw was a samurai's memory that was buried in the land.
first of all, i'm an adult. second, i didn't just break in...
(i've been told that the infirmary is always empty for the half hour just before lunch. but what could sigewinne be doing during that time?)
i'm sorry for letting you see me in a mess like this... i don't usually cry, really.
an amicassador's seal, a small box... a knife? a bow, and something wrapped up tight... i wonder what this is.
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
did the medicine have any side effects for you?
i've watched furuyama brew tea on many occasions... i doubt i should have any major problems doing it myself.
you see these people? they're all miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave shingo's body. then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
alright, follow me. i'll take you there.
it's peaceful here, like... a leaf floating in the middle of a perfectly still pond...
it's simple. apart from you, this space only consists of real people who are dreaming and imaginary people who were created here.
haven't you noticed yet? most of our "convincing" ends in a fight.
lyney's right. we need to keep going. the future of the kingdom depends on it.
(uh-oh! a critical failure!)
trailblazing to a world that even akivili has never been to... is that possible?
indeed, although they'll still have the chance to be born again, they've lost their memories of their journey and their feelings for their homeland.
presumably... miss sparkle is now carefully arranging the next crime scene, right?
and by the way, since we'll be filming "the two musketeers", we'll need to find an action choreographer... ideally, a professional who has actual experience with muskets.
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
himeko really knows how to convince people. hehe, between leviathan fossils and the wardance, the latter definitely sounds more fun.
even in the ice... could these guys still be alive...?
especially those whose health is compromised to begin with... like dunyarzad. this relentless exploitation takes an even harder toll on them.
have i not made myself clear? you're barking up the wrong tree. i don't want this job, nor do i know of anyone else who would.
individual ambition is inherently incompatible with eternity.
right, because they'll think they've already found the culprit...
the names on the tablet...
yeah, i wonder how many tickets... hey, that's not what we should be concerned about!
just give me a sec! i'll play with you once i'm done.
hmph. you are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. descendant of the takatsukasa clan, you wish to become the new tenryou commissioner. do i understand this correctly?
*panting* ...i really need to keep up with my training.
this fungus didn't develop from a spore. it's an elemental life-form.
*sigh* ...come on, those toys of yours aren't that dangerous.
it's all black around the edges!
though your power was weak, i was still able to find you. you were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
leave it here, and i shall sample it.
it seems i'm the one who came out on top this time, hehe. i'm actually quite enjoying myself... how about we go for another round?
hey, you already took a train that runs on water. is a flying train really that much weirder?
the present situation is... we're here! this planet isn't doomed after all...
you wanted criminals sure know how to look on the bright side of things...
when all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved inazuma, forever and ever. isn't that right?
there's no shortage of surprises in life.
also, now that i've relaxed... i'm suddenly really sleepy...
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
...great, even if qlipoth were here, they wouldn't be able to protect him.
...these spaces have been disappearing one after the other... absorbed by something like a sun in the sky...
i had to deal with the forbidden knowledge to save their homeland. the process, however, took away some of my memories.
oh dear, we've been chatting for quite some time. i'm sorry for keeping you.
ugh... why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
w--wait a minute! this isn't what we agreed! she said we were gonna be escorted to discuss an urgent matter!
scrap metal, huh?... the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
we'd need far more solid proof before we can hope to go charging in on our enemy.
definitely the kind of place where you can have a proper rest and really relax.
if the first clue was any indication, then the location described in this clue should also be related to my life experiences.
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
perhaps "hope" means the desire to satisfy the eater.
navigators really do have their plates full, huh? seems like it's just you and me this time.
oh, right, she did give me some sort of card...
no matter how much damage we do, it just heals itself... not fair!
aunt gertie, isn't that you in the photo? and old goethe, too! you look so young!
it was almost like a gentle rain, arriving just in time to put out a fire that was about to spread.
but, since there are so many doors here... we should be able to leave through one of them...
some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
if all our memories of a day are erased at the end of that day, then we would unwittingly relive the same day again and again.
wh--what...? ah! you're so annoying! stop scaring me!
but if we were to "borrow" some of her close acquaintances to talk with her... her reaction would probably be very different.
hook pretended to be well-behaved for a month in order to get junjun. she ate on time, slept on time -- even stopped fighting with the other kids...
huh? you don't look that tired to me... stop playing around.
oh, what's the difference between the two?
you're right! those roots never grew back!
it was as if a single sheet of paper was separating those memories from your consciousness.
their duty was to tear open a passage through space with their claws and teeth, and then call in even more powerful beasts.
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara... we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully...
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
but without a doubt... she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. it's like aventurine said just then. it's best to keep your distance from her.
she had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
so here's what will happen during my thesis defense: after i present my thesis, the advisers sitting below will begin to ask questions.
*sigh* i told you that you two are special. other people can't see me or miss dunyarzad here.
i can't believe how close it is to the city center...
well hello there, little one. oh? i see you've brought a special guest.
is it? i just want them to try it. it would be a shame for them to miss out on dango milk.
oh, come on, don't be hasty. i have a good reason for interrupting, you know. now, would anyone here like to take a little break from all this debate, and see a little magic?
*sigh* looks like i'll have to do it by myself this time.
when exploring opportunities, one such as he, a gambler, will never reject your overtures. gratify his whims, but also keep your defenses up.
this isn't going as planned... what should we do?
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
jumping through all those hoops in the matrix was pretty exhausting, but this little gift makes me feel like it was worth it.
alas, the interesting questions have all vanished in an instant. it appears i'm the one spoiling the fun here. i'll see myself out.
haha. sometimes face-to-face communication is more meaningful, don't you think?
regardless of whether he left you a parasol or a sword, he must have done so to give you a better life.
hmm... probably a scene from ancient inazuma.
and so... it falls to me to place the truth before your eyes, in all its ugliness.
(right! "mirror-me" said that i just need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be...)
of course, it'd be even better if we could unravel the mystery of your past along the way!
those two fungi might be waiting for it to return.
probably. although fungi are simple creatures, they're very sensitive to elemental power.
what exactly is he... talking about?
all i mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: you have to combine it with another print.
this is the luxury store i told about you earlier.
the dissolving power of water from the primordial sea is an important secret for the true culprit of the serial disappearances case.
it's a long story...
if that's the case... how about we go to edo star first? if that planet really is in danger, then we should go help them out.
instead, i would like to charge you as a fraud who's never been the archon in the first place.
mm... it's a long story. simply put, dan heng used the jade abacus of allying oath when we were in the middle of a fierce battle, and summoned the general to help us just in time.
and that is what you have been doing all along.
well then, we shall oblige.
the more i think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
oh, i'm sorry... it's just that i'm really excited. this is the first time this has happened, really! i'm so happy.
we have to choose where we want to rest forever.
it turns out that there is still another piece to the story of kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
ah, great! as the king of constellation metropole, i extend to you my gratitude.
then you should hold onto that. if a good man had to do a bad thing, then he must have had his reasons.
any clear evidence of my existence would only hinder my ability to conceal my identity. it would also expose me to layla as well.
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
and who is this softly spoken little lady?
huh!? oh, um... i'm not sure i'll have enough energy for that...
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
the youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
don't blame yourself, monsieur neuvillette. deciphering ancient stone slates isn't one of your duties.
so... where are we headed to now, bronya?
history fictionologist? so what everything you told us was made up?
it sounds like you know the balladeer quite well.
is that really a bad thing, though? it can get tough always being the one shouldering everyone's expectations.
ah, by "newbie" you mean me, right?
years of torment is what turned them into their current state. their external form has become their shackles...
i see... though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
melus, set the stove up again, if you would.
a bird with sharp edges and points... umm, i don't think i saw it.
on the matter of the statue, we should still come up with a few more ideas for the design. i'll have to trouble you to source some for me.
hey! don't pull on my hand, i -- ow, ow, ow, hot, hot, hot!
oh, sorry, i'm starting to ramble again. what were we talking about before...? oh right, why the seelie led us here.
oh, sorry, i meant our own boat. the aquabus doesn't have a station near poisson, so we'll use one of the spina's boats.
my father is a famous surgeon in belobog. because of his fame, people in medical circles paid great attention to his surgeries... he always had a lot of stress to deal with.
nothing... i suppose my presence will be indispensable if we are to restore his faith in the show.
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
if you use real people as your weapon and turn them against their archon, then there's nothing the archon can do.
aunt gertie! it's been too long!
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
nobody did, but it never hurts to be prepared!
i could do with a cup once we're done here...
alright. there's little purpose in keeping anything hidden from you, anyway.
hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. you can most definitely afford it... they're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. you have quite the generous payment due.
but in her own life, her greatest desire wasn't to be the center of attention... i can tell how much she loved you all, and how much she loved the troupe.
don't worry, i'm just...
(it seems that fungus won't be moving for the moment. i should hurry and make my way through.)
delicious. i feel much better after that. thank you.
i mean... it's possible. but i can't help but wonder why he's so keen for us to speed up.
i hope the ipc made an effort to create some easy-to-follow routes for the players this time...
sure thing. i'd like you two to share the moment with me. after all, without you, there might not have been such a positive ending.
whoa! sounds incredible! but... are there any side effects?
so you've made up your mind? about giving up the goddess's gift?
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
there's no point in being depressed while we still have a disaster on our hands. as my father's successor, i must live up to the hopes he had in me.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
it's extremely difficult, yes. but the only ones who can do it are you two. remember, everything you've achieved up to this point has all been for the sake of finding the host and ending the samsara.
...i hope so. the day i learned the truth was the day i no longer recognized my brother.
and that's when they sent topaz over to collect the debt...
...so you promise that if i win hide-and-seek, you'll tell big sister march all the ins and outs.
the truth, the original sin, the trial... and the root cause of the disaster.
to put it simply, makoto wasn't concerned about outcomes.
ohh... i've been looking forward to this a lot...
even though my parents had very different personalities, they always had a lot of respect for each other.
of course! we should be fully prepared before going in.
so what exactly is... forbidden knowledge?
don't feel discouraged! the world needs people who aren't afraid to innovate.
but, it's a little... uncivilized, isn't it?
how many years ago was it? i don't know...
you've been explaining a lot about the venue, but i'm still confused about the game. can we actually give it a go?
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
just think of that soldier. despite all the losses he had experienced, he still chose to keep fighting, for the sake of moving forward.
i will say, i never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, clorinde.
huh? a swim?
but i will cure all of them... even if it's just for the sake of the rainforest and all the life-forms that live in it.
a dream i wished i could have continued after waking up...
be careful. don't get fooled by her again.
...alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you... for now.
be it vache or the mutual aid society -- forces like that can take full advantage of the... the typical underworld state of mind.
since when did i become "miss" march? and where's hook and the others? come on, call them over.
i'm really sorry for bringing down the vibe! quick, dan heng, tell us a dad joke to lighten the mood!
no. she was not created to ever be turned off.
yeah, of course. many years ago, something called "sinthe" began to gain popularity in poisson.
as for wildfire, we need more time to build up our strength.
sinking? you mean... the dreamscape is collapsing?
phew, finally... after all that, there's just one option left!
i'd rather not play around. we don't have very much time.
so you kids think you're better than us, huh? just you wait and see!
huh? c'mon, don't worry about that! rng is the lifeblood of roleplaying games! i'm going with with "authentic mode" for sure!
okay, that's positive. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
i... i dunno. she's being a little creepy...
you said you don't have any plans, right? so we can just catch a boat and head over. it won't take long at all.
ugh, can you and the fern get a room already? how can anyone establish a bond with a houseplant? ...although i guess you could say the same about me and my teddy bears...
my, my. yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. i like it very much.
i see... it seems like you have made up your mind.
...a draw? this isn't a tournament, y'know! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
i'll help, too! still, i think we need to take care of the dragon first. we don't want it to start causing trouble when we're trying to load people onto the ship.
i--it's not that i don't trust you... it's just...
whew! okay, enough! i'm not taking any medicine. i'll just tough it out!
...oh, right. it started from the moment i was born.
y--you really are crazy... if the experiment succeeded, you would have had a new god on your hands. how would you have faced your own god then?
...memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
kamisato... one of the most distinguished clans in all of inazuma. eh? that's exactly what the shogun said? well, a--ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.
my dear partner, can i leave the clementine line to you?
although i don't know what you might be keeping from everyone... your people are more than willing to share your burden with you.
...there's nothing wrong with being a casual player.
by the way, miko mentioned that she founded something called the yae publishing house to sell some sort of... light novels.
so now, i've understood the meaning of my second "death", and i am prepared to face it. if all goes well, my efforts will provide crucial support for you.
but that general huaiyan, he looks... so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. is that old man really an arbiter-general?
the other obsession is probably related to his past. i can't quite explain it.
(i've heard this name before... sometime recently. i'm sure of it...)
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver... i just want to get there in one piece.
ahahahahahaha, oh, urakusai, you haven't changed a bit. you caught on so quickly. too perfect.
something else i noticed was that according to these records, the fatui have not classified your sibling as one of the "descenders."
there there... chin up, pom-pom! don't be sad. don't cry...
i understand that. but if the dreams of which makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
something else worrying you? ...something that you can't share?
hey, come on now, seele's got a sharp tongue but a soft heart. she didn't mean anything.
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
huh? serval, aren't you gonna look for the stellaron with us?
no... you are not trying to do any of that. i can hear it in your voice. there's no emotion behind your words -- you only said those things because you felt like you should.
okay, paimon, can you tell us your perspective of what really happened yesterday...
from the traces they've left in the surrounding area, there should be many more monsters nearby. all of them must be eliminated.
(i've been getting hungry thinking about food all this time...)
oh, by the way -- since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
say no more! we're good at this. don't worry!
we can and we will! i think it's great!
(i--it kinda works, right...?)
then, we removed the remaining pollution from irminsul...
what!? topaz!? do you know where they went?
this is also the only place where one can fully experience the core values of syrupism...
i'm really worried about the future of penacony...
silver once said that a name is a kind of inscription -- a way to etch a memory into the world. when given a name, a cold, inanimate object can gain a completely new meaning.
ugh, can't we run around to them for a change!?
i see, that makes sense...
but what good would that do? how can a hollow verdict protect anyone?
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
of course, i know everyone here. on penacony, anyone could be lying... but the remembrance does not lie.
hey, be a bit more serious. we're live on air!
it may also be that miss firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
ugh, well that escalated quickly. not a good start... could i ask you all to please calm down?
you're the best, master diviner!
oh, don't say that. besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
don't worry, i should be able to find them. just leave it to me.
alright, i need to get myself ready... it won't be easy to break it to her, but there's no avoiding it now.
if we manage to convince her, i'm quite sure we'll be able to get you another audience with the raiden shogun.
...but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
is that me!? wh--what's she saying...
until the abyss has engulfed the thrones, my war with destiny will see no end...
i'm not talking about the puppet. i mean... her. you've met her, yes?
okay, we don't have time to really look into it right now. let's strike while the iron is still hot, and wrap this thing up once and for all.
they cannot be made to continue paying the price... for those so-called sins.
hehe, and it's got a real healthy amount of suspense, right? i mean, even the gm doesn't know how the story will end!
i believe in you guys... i know you'll be able to get her to come around!
these two are my friends! as for the man lying on the ground... he's a scaredy-cat who fainted from fright.
i see. so you want to become a small animal in your dreams, right? why do you think that sounds good to you?
do you really see me as your "partner"?
clockie? i can also see him... is this character part of the show?
well, anyway, enough talk! let's get started! i want to experience at least a good chunk of the story today.
sorry, i don't usually get this emotional... how have you been, mister oswell? thank you so much for taking care of my parents these last ten years.
then we'll have to enter with the risk of being noticed. we may not be able to avoid a fight.
...they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
after the reopening of the furnace core passage, i had an idea. i wrote a letter and asked sampo to deliver it to my parents' old address.
hmm-hmm. after we parted on the last day of the sabzeruz festival, i left the city and saw what the traveler had described.
i guess he didn't want to be recognized or bothered by anyone.
human beings don't have powers like us youkai. it's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
don't run! i got you, hook!
i assumed that the heavenly principles wouldn't just stand by and let such extensive damage to its "laws" take place.
but the fact is that both the food and the stories have changed with time...
to tell you the truth, i'm still not sure whether i have what it takes to represent the rtawahist darshan in the championship.
although... it felt like she was looking through me. as in, i know she was speaking to us, but it seemed like her gaze was fixed on something far away...
after leaving tatarasuna, the balladeer ran into this child who didn't have a name, just like him. they made a promise to live together.
so, who exactly is this elite player?
it's a common trope in light novels, right? you just have to have a bit of bravado. as soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
people exchanging knowledge with the god of wisdom is the stuff of legends, yet here you wish to exchange knowledge for the god of wisdom's property...
*sigh* look, friends and family will remember what you've done, and even some people you've never met may benefit from your actions.
when this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
can you wait for a minute? i'd like to wash my face. i think it'd be refreshing.
that's basically how i feel about it... even if i know nothing about the blessing, i could still feel its companionship all along.
i understand. just leave it to us.
you guys must be exhausted standing here all day. how about you take a little lunch break -- i'm sure the ipc allows that, right?
you keep playing. i'll go and get some drinks.
haha, i'm grateful.
thank you so much! i'll try my best to contribute, too. i don't want to be a burden to you guys.
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
hehe, well, maybe you should be worrying less about that and more about how exactly you are going to thank me... no?
uh... got it. thanks...
looks like i passed the test, right?
first things first. follow me to the entrance.
the truth does not lie. neither do memories.
the most terrible form? does that mean...?
(no, this won't work... they'll suspect me again. i must play the role that they want me to play.)
are you sure? okay then. oh, traveler, do you still have the omamori i gave you?
so, if there's anyone in the world capable of retaining memories from a past that has been rewritten, it's you. it's... quite incredible, when you think about it.
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
mm... i truly hope so.
the former sages have received their punishment, but the new sages have yet to be selected. i will oversee the process personally.
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
okay, we should be going now.
i used to always lose sleep because of those pests, but thankfully there's nothing like that here.
no need for the melodrama. that was still a magical performance...
that's exactly right, nilou. that's basically what's happening.
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides...
silver, it hurts... my head is spinning... all i can see is stars swirling in front of me.
why was this tv... dumped on the side of the road?
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
i guess it's... time for us to say goodbye...
you have already witnessed my previous views on eternity.
as long as the final moment hasn't come, it's still not too late...
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
quickly, come help! i bumped into a member of the family on the way here. he was so scared and i just wanted to calm him down. but...
(oh dear, what do i do? even i think they sound convincing now! have i falsely accused an innocent person? ugh, what a humiliation...)
i'm sorry, but it's the truth. they weren't the only people we lost, either. many others, including melissa, also lost their lives in the disaster.
since then, every time i encounter an obstacle in my thinking, i find myself having the urge to spend some time in the outside world.
nothing looks out of place, and everything's spaced out just right.
(after that, the true culprit turned the third person into water, erasing all traces of him from the scene.)
exactly, he can't. and even if he could, i don't think he would be able to dispatch a whole group so quickly.
(according to lyney, he left via the vent after entering the tunnel. he couldn't have had that altercation with halsey.)
where's our next stop? we should find somewhere to put our feet up, as long as it's not goethe hotel again...
in the end, i'm just the moon. the real sun is long gone.
i've got an idea. can you teach me how to change into a fungus?
as you can see, she isn't doing well. you probably sensed it, too -- the dunyarzad you were just with is different from the first dunyarzad you met.
uh... why would he say that?
okay, let's go. to the fishing spot!
after all, she and i are one and the same. we're two sides of the same coin.
so... the train has been swallowed by a giant bug? and we're inside its stomach?
thank goodness the general didn't make us go with the knights... fighting is totally different from adventuring. all these people... i--it's tough to bear.
whoa... i felt like i suddenly lost weight when we passed through.
of course, it would be nice to know what's really going on...
the underworld? what do you want to know?
i still remember the question on the invitation letter -- why does life slumber?
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off...
something that mom isn't supposed to know?
hehe, i told you compliments make me better.
in the bar? but aren't all the ingredients right there on the counter?
since you invited me and all... sure.
oh, what's wrong? you look like you've got something on your mind.
everything outside is... red. what's going on?
this has certainly been a memorable series of events.
miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
(lyney was not in the tunnel at that moment, which gave our criminal ample time.)
then let's put that discussion to the side for now. we still have time.
he may well have had an inkling about there being two "raiden shoguns." but he always acted as if he was completely unaware of it.
that's right! unparalleled!
it's all done... victory is in sight. let's head to the final stage.
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
it's okay. these things take time. moving on from a painful experience is easier said than done.
yes. it'll take a lot of power from me, but it still won't be anything compared to when i was in the desert...
yeah, let's not forget our bet!
thank you for understanding. if i were the one complaining about not being well-rested, it would just sound like an excuse.
i'm afraid so... its body and soul have probably been in terrible shape for some time now.
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
wonder if i'll find one here.
(halsey is the missing person and an ordinary audience member... or did she have her own scheme all along?)
i think we should look around where the avidya leopards attacked me.
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
about time i got some credit for it!
bronya moves fast! the crisis is only just over and she's already opened talks with the ipc.
hitomi, go tell the others that the test of courage has ended and that we have a winner.
but for now, at least... i think i should stay with the way i'm feeling for a while longer.
oh, is that so? and if i may ask, what did you hear while you were inside your box?
since i am its creator, i will take responsibility for it. i assure you there's no need to worry.
perhaps it's just my wishful thinking, but i think she did this deliberately, as her way of keeping our friendship eternal.
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze... when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
oh, um, i... i don't think that will be necessary...
*whimper*... i can't go on... too weak...
what about you, dear partner? how would you like to play?
i wouldn't be relieved just yet.
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
whoa... this atmosphere is crazy!
oh? such elusive emotions... i've never encountered memories quite like this before, it's stirred my curiosity.
the traveler wasn't affected after coming in contact with that consciousness. i've never seen anyone like that. with you here, we may have a chance at deciphering it...
ahhhh... well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
it's not what she's saying, it's the way she's saying it!
they thought their god would protect them. they had absolute faith that when disaster struck, a divine power would save them from harm.
...never mind. i'm fine with silence.
so, what's your new hypothesis?
hahaha! not gonna lie, "your majesty" is definitely growing on me...
no, it's nothing. this is the first time we've ever met, but your name seemed familiar to me. i must have heard it when i was discussing things with your husband previously.
so... so we did it?
i noticed it also. just now, in the heat of battle, it seemed to unleash a new and unfamiliar power.
yes. inazuma was facing many great crises at that time. some were local in origin, while others... others came from the now-fallen kingdom of khaenri'ah.
however, we can assume that lyney and lynette were not alone within it. some criminal also occupied its sealed confines.
huh? but didn't you just say that you're a director?
his being yet again demonstrates that... there are those who, despite being offered countless choices, will always choose the same path.
um, is it too late for a do-over?
are you sure there isn't a little bit of truth in that? under normal circumstances, shouldn't you have been called back to the city already?
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
...or he wasn't telling us the truth?
hm? people always say they feel a sense of relief after they take a dook-dook. that's why i suggested you could try that. is that so strange?
i understand, and i'm sorry. but...
oh, c'mon layla, what are you doing? everyone's gonna start thinking you're crazy now...
this game will be over soon... this time, we're going to catch her.
that's right. my current hypothesis is that the "first descender" was likely what we now call the heavenly principles.
she's a resilient girl, but no matter how resilient she may be, no one can hold up to criticism and torment from themselves.
(and as for the judge... huh? where's monsieur neuvillette?)
i should take action when i'm needed and give it my all when the moment calls.
we should be close...
it's alright, paimon. it can't replace you.
...but even so, a quote i read back in school came to me just now: "those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
then why didn't you reply? bronya's a good friend of ours!
don't imitate the memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! well...
i also look forward to the day that a member of the vahumana darshan can not only comprehend his theories, but also find a way out from the despair as well.
but, i'm stuck in the sanctuary of surasthana...
i think we've all seen enough now, and we have ample witnesses to my flawless reasoning.
i only wish to express my blessings for the express. these are words specially imbued with a blessing of remembrance -- they hail from a distant, ancient planet.
wait... then if that's the case... doesn't that imply that apep has also been contaminated by forbidden knowledge?
the names of all the marechaussee hunters from ages past and their weapons?
seele and i actually aren't from here. we both come from an industrial town to the north. a few years ago, the fragmentum began to seep into the town center.
do you remember how the akasha can turn dreams into jnana energy?
don't you worry. you still have a long journey ahead of you... your story has only just begun.
that's right. having worked for such a long time, you of all people must know what makes a good hammer.
well... *sigh* i guess i have to keep looking up as much info as possible. i shouldn't give up now.
me? i'd suggest you go yourself. even if you don't want any more dealings with her, it's best to say that to her in person... reading this message, it seems like she may really need your help.
a place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic... so, that was the "turbulence" i was sensing.
not so. only everything that pertains to eternity.
it'll improve the quality of your sleep. seems like very helpful advice, so are you gonna take it?
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
i'll keep up the search. that said, i've noticed that the number of butterflies in the city has already decreased a lot compared to when the event started.
hahaha... and what a fine family yours is, indeed! it brings me great joy to meet such a faithful believer, a descendant of a line most ardent.
an argument with near-impossible odds, huh? we have to not only refute furina's claims, but also overturn the long-held beliefs of the people...
ah, i see. well, that can be fixed. i'll just have the yashiro commission order a few hundred cups and go door-to-door delivering them.
yes, you're right. after all, the shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
but at least i can say that i no longer desire to play any new roles.
if we can break out of this samsara, i might be able to save her.
...there is something else he cares more about and needs -- or should i say, is verifying.
the puppet, yes. i've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
oh, all right. you stay safe.
i shall return to tenshukaku. miko told me that the test of courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
it appears we can't climb the stairs in our current state...
i trust her judgment too, but...
traveler, aside from your memories that were just restored, i have another message for you.
mister yang? mister yang's here too? didn't he stay on the express?
then, what of the one who crossed blades with his own sensei and beloved fellow disciple, and defeated them both? can one truly remain unagitated, of still mind, in moments such as these?
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
we cannot make an enemy of the divine. no matter what we do, the will of the heavenly principles will have its way, and the prophecy shall be fulfilled...
what, you're leaving already? but you haven't asked me about my dreams! i've been working hard too, you know!
which means that the content of this book must have been approved by her... in fact, no. it may even have been her idea in the first place.
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
dan heng, do you even have a heart? did you lose it somewhere?
hahaha! see, silver and melus? i told you they'd be different!
you know, speaking of which... the old dunyarzad might not have been too different from a puppet.
your guards are still fighting the monsters as we speak. they could be seriously wounded and in grave need of support. you need all the help you can get!
she can no longer justify everything to herself...
come on. let's keep investigating the damage to the sacred sakura.
there are no monsters, nor is there anything else here that could threaten your life.
since there is such a great deal of difference between the story and the reality, i don't feel offended at all. on the contrary, i find the author's powers of imagination quite admirable.
of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
things just got serious. "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is an all-round hit, summarily beating the novels of the yae publishing house by every analysis.
no one knows who or what it actually is... it's just known as the wisdom seelie.
how about you? can you relate to that feeling? it's almost like not knowing the world will change or ever expecting it to change.
ah, so this is what it is. yes... you deserve praise for the effort you took to raise the dramatic stakes.
what's going on inside the mine? any ideas?
i was just drifting out there in space and got picked up by the express. amazing, right?
over there! clara went down on the elevator.
the culprit could only time their actions so precisely if they were already at the scene.
luocha turns a corner, but the corner leads straight to an inn... then he exits the inn and goes into spare time book shop without buying anything.
and parries should be fluid and nimble! got it.
hehe, how amusing. the almighty shogun goes downtown and suddenly she's like a wide-eyed country girl trying to find her bearings in the big city. marvelous.
haha, i believe we're dealing with kind-hearted people here, seele.
if the stars dictate destiny, then do you think that destiny is something that is unchanging and always follows predicted outcomes?
it's exhausting, but i guess you already saw that... which is probably why you suggested i take a vacation a--and get some proper rest, right?
(hundreds of years must have passed by now. perhaps this show must go on for hundreds more...)
i hope bronya takes these words seriously.
thanks. i feel like i'm starting to get the hang of it.
i wasn't sure. it was just a hunch, but since misha feels familiar with this place... my hunch might be correct.
ugh, who could it be...?
the aim is to try not to get hit by the attacks. since you've escaped certain death at her hand once already, i presume this shouldn't be more than you can handle?
(furina, you've worked so hard for so, so long. surely it would be okay to put yourself first for once... just this once?)
that's the one. actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. it's a spell to help calm the ley line memories.
i was so close to bursting into tears! that would've been embarrassing...
general, did you... hear about miss tingyun...?
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
...just the thought of our lives being predestined from birth makes me shiver!
i do love spina di rosula's logo. it was designed by my mother. have you noticed how it's shaped like a heart?
maybe you can just stay behind this time, mister yang...?
i know you must have a lot of questions. please, allow me to explain.
(think about it long and hard...)
you'd better be careful. don't get too close to blitzara when you're knee-deep in the water, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a very unique lower-leg massage.
hmm... maybe he dyed his hair!
...whoa, looks like the battle here was intense...
but if you so much as think about pulling something like this again, i won't be so lenient next time. understood?
just outside the mall is the plaza. follow me! i'll buy you a nice meal!
done! it took some effort, but we finally cracked these mechanisms...
then i'll be straight with you. in your previous incarnation, you did many things that would be considered evil.
ah! well if it isn't my dear partners!
looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. and he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
your school practices meikyou shisui art, does it not?
no need to thank me. rather, thank your own sense of perseverance instead. long have you stood in line to meet me, have you not?
but you two sometimes stay out the entire night anyway, so at the time, i didn't think too much about it.
since you insist on claiming to be a god and not a human, then there's a method that you can use right here and now to eliminate all suspicions of you being the latter.
(yes. only if he understands this can he choose a new path forward.)
wow... this place is really lively...
i--it's bigger than i thought... hey you, i was just joking! leave us alone, shoo!
from a director's point of view, i also felt like the relationship between the two musketeers in the original story could be improved.
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express...?
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will help you safely reach the floor right below this room.
you and origami bird are friends?
ugh... but we haven't done anything wrong!
to have a place like that suddenly appear before me...
hehe, let's do it. i already have an idea.
look, that's the penacony grand theater over there.
hmm, i see. so the thunderstorm is drawing closer...
i see... let's go somewhere else then.
i... i can't believe... you...
no matter what, i hope you can trust aventurine -- or rather -- trust me and see the "truth" with your own eyes. this can lead us deeper into the secrets behind penacony.
well, there's no way he'd get past dan heng's sharp eyes.
anyway. be gone. do not disturb my solitude.
the stars in the sky are something that brings happiness to people.
hey, they're finally back!
several people say that when they've walked by that lab at night, they heard the sound of someone sighing inside.
you can't know for sure whether the diarrhea was caused by eating the fox or by something inside the fox's stomach. does that make sense?
huh? it's a... picture?
but this is just our first meeting. it's a little too early to announce it to the general public.
look after twirly-whirly for me... take him with you to the top!
this foreign gnosis will only lead to disaster if it stays in sumeru...
miss black swan, we fully understand our current predicament now. going back to your original suggestion...
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
let's head back now. don't come back to this place again for the time being.
yeah... that's the only way we'll know for sure...
for us to meet now is premature. nevertheless, you set foot on these islands at precisely the right moment.
so, pitch-dark hook the great, you can tell us now, right?
no way! the boss will recognize us, plus silvermane guards are stationed nearby. we'd be offering ourselves up on a silver platter!
ah... haha... okay...
*sigh* we'll just have to head straight and keep looking.
brother and sister landau...? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be...
i tried to understand what i had been doing when i'm unconscious, but i've never been able to get any definitive evidence.
you have to try this fish. it's found exclusively in the waters around seirai island. they shipped it to inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until i ordered it.
every side of me is the real me. people just like to define things in all sorts of arbitrary ways.
hehe, i'm sure you'd just get even sleepier if i delved more deeply into it. anyway, i was just thinking about how grateful i am to my mother, as well as the rest of the spina.
thank you... nothing makes me happier than discovering that the archon i always admired was in fact myself in another fate.
very good, but let's not let our guard down for now.
and here we are! the best viewing spot in all of golden hour! look, there's even a telescope here! when the charmony festival arrives, remember to be here early if you wanna get a seat.
that's why you have to develop your talent pool -- otherwise everything falls apart when you go on vacation...
phew, i'll take a monitor over a red-hot heater any day...
marcel, the head of confrerie of cabriere!
with me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
however, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well...
then first, we have to restore the sky back to its original state by putting the stars back in their positions. let me do a quick count...
so in other words... the predestined lives these people lead were always going to disappear one way or another.
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
woah, woah, woah! i know i was the one that handed you the script, but some of us haven't read it yet! no spoilers, please!
please, sir, don't get too worked up. you need to focus on your recovery. just leave the monsters to us -- we're marechaussee hunters, after all.
w--withdraw? can you even do that?
can you still sense where the heart of irminsul is?
mm-hmm, they're a group of lovely little creatures. they're just a bit timid around strangers.
here, keep it... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
(*sigh* true... he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
how could something so beautiful be unsafe?
it compiles the wisdom of the entire populace.
(i know all these people... why are they laughing?)
when that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
alright, alright, no more joking around. perhaps you could... oh i don't know, cut the line when she's on a break.
whenever you have such thoughts, just look at the people and things around you.
hey! that's a terrible idea! you'll get them arrested!
i must have been dreaming... melus and silver were still alive, and they were... they were defending me at some insane trial.
well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that i am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
as for you... you've found a unique way to become the owner of this dream, going so far as to have even given up the ability to wake up again.
...selling fake medicine with false kindness. you should have expected trouble to find you sooner or later.
(korina, desyree, joinville, jolienne, essonnes... and mister giverny and misess bernette, who we met earlier...)
let's find her and tell her about bronya's decision.
the desserts are great, but i'm still looking forward to the story more than anything.
the kujou clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. kamaji is hardly a great heir to the kujou name, but...
drop it, skott is in the midst of introspection.
and besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce inazuma to all teyvat through light novels. as they say, it's two birds with one stone.
*sigh* no, all my friends are back home. i'm the only one who got to come study at the akademiya.
well, you can rest easy, friend! the righteous and formidable marechaussee hunters are on the case!
but things are different now. it should be a lot easier to prove the other side's guilt now that we've connected sinthe with the disappearances case.
i believed you were incapable of transcending the past. but it seems my belief was baseless and i underestimated your spirit.
really? sounds a little...
the gun he was holding probably belonged to jacques, or a third person on the scene.
...give it a little push... and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
it's really you. i knew i didn't get the wrong person.
well? the things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
how adorable. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
however, the weather was rainy every single day after i borrowed it, and i was unable to compare the night sky against the celestial globe.
...anyway, that's not the point!
people will never achieve true happiness in a world like that! they would just be toys for the aeon!
uh... how exactly are you going to defeat him?
hey, i can totally take care of myself! for the time being, i'll go around without any attendants.
the queen's crown still doesn't have a sequel yet? pity, a classic like that where justice overcomes evil never gets old.
careful, looks like we've got more company! get ready to fire!
what? she just ditched us and went back? how could you let her...
i'm not trying to talk our way out of this, but... we're not friends with that scoundrel. did you see how fast he ditched us?
the next thing i knew, everything was covered with muddy water... me, and all my equipment.
...good, you adapted quickly this time.
last time we took a walk around inazuma together, i witnessed the way the world is today. i was finally able to comprehend some things that i had never understood in the past.
each of us need to be mindful of the state of our own consciousness while we are here.
that's because you were zonked out the whole ride. no one had the chance to tell you.
i'll become a blade of grass or a twig. basically, i'll return to how i was first born.
i'm going to head back and make some preparations. meet me outside the yae publishing house.
his future will be determined by fate.
could you tell me... why you wanted to create me? and what exactly happened when you died...
all set? let's move out, then.
don't be sad. it did it to protect you. your happiness is more important to it than anything else in the world.
the balladeer agreed to help me look for information about the descenders, and although he was unsuccessful, he still helped you.
ah no, we're here to rest... my problems will have to wait for now.
what are you laughing at? i don't see what's so funny.
i--i won't put on any weight since this is all a dream...
i'm just thinking, you haven't slept in twenty system hours... are you sure you're okay?
sorry, i didn't notice.
so a photo is a visual representation... an impression, like casting a shadow...
so... no one's gonna say anything? then i'll raise my hand -- i know the answer to this question!
i can't even figure out these basic questions, and most of what i've learned in the past is completely useless here...
the wind never blows in the sanctuary of surasthana... oh, sorry. that's probably obvious to you.
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out... and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek... do you get it?
how about a divination?
...i still haven't managed to decipher it. even the akasha isn't currently capable of doing that.
that is the nature of truth. if one thing is right, its opposite must be wrong, and yet dichotomies like this are not enough to explain the world in all of its complexity.
*panting* as expected, i lost... how would i be able to beat an adventurer at something like this...?
so you also remember two gunshots, then?
if she knew that there's another layla who is capable of doing everything, she may think even less of herself.
*yawn* well, here we are. i feel sleepy already.
that's why i still haven't performed the necessary observations yet. i don't know what to do.
i think i understand.
n--no i don't! *pretend yawn* besides, i've never pulled an all-nighter before! do you know how bad it is for your skin?
hey! this level of gaming is just perfect for me!
i feel like going back to reality and resting too... come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
i must admit, though, i'm a little envious... they're quite fortunate to be able to bid farewell to their past in such a magnificent manner.
now, if i only had a bottle of sake, that would make it perfect.
we've passed the test, but we ought to hurry up... the stellaron is at stake.
hmm? haven't i already mentioned that i cannot make food?
you've all picked such classic skills! it's fine to go a little bit out of the box, you know.
no wonder yinshu said she had to cover her nose...
you'd make sure that i didn't notice anything amiss, before revealing yourself as my prosecutor once we'd arrived onto the stage...
here, it's over here! whew, good thing it's dry. i was worried the message might be wet.
i'm going up against skott soon. do you know why i'm visiting you, qingque?
what i'm working on now is the research and prediction of the triple-orbit shift phenomenon.
*sigh* i still haven't made much headway on my thesis. at this rate, i'll need the wisdom seelie's help.
penacony... itself?
declining would be like admitting defeat! of course i'll accept it!
...are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
...mister gallagher, you even know my name?
hmm... i can't seem to cohesively piece everything together.
hehehe, is that so? then i suppose i must have missed my final chance...
i... do i really look that bad?
um... miss himeko, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn't sound like a negotiation...
maybe neuvillette was right... maybe "clio" is the right role for me.
(that really doesn't sound like the kind of childhood someone should have...)
it's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. the desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip... how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword..."
mm-hmm. the object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the gnosis... and the prototype puppet is now known as "the balladeer."
could we tone down the narcissism just a tad?
wait a minute, we forgot to ask seele! let's go see what she has to say.
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
theoretically, this should also give you absolute control over this place. i have to admit, it really doesn't get much better than that.
please, tell me! you promised you'd help.
hmm... weird mask, strange vibes, a little out of touch...
there are few things more uplifting than taking the first step on a new journey.
you even told me then that you thought there was something fishy with the case, yet you still allowed the duel to go ahead.
yeah! makes sense to me.
so, how about this? i've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
alright, just kidding. just trying to liven things up around here.
...why do you look so unimpressed?
taking pictures. writing in my diary. what else is there to say~?
but even if your burden doesn't need to be shared... you can still choose to confide in someone.
melus and silver... they won't ever come back here again...
so, we arranged for a second group to lie in wait there...
hey, the shape seems to match. so, this shard is also connected to misha?
fireflies and butterflies often fly to me, but spiders and cockroaches come too... that's why i prefer cold places. but when the temperature drops, i also don't want to move. what a dilemma...
there's a mushroom here. you wanna jump on it to see what's up there?
ahhhh. there's nothing like dessert for improving one's mood. much more enjoyable than meditating alone all the time.
what should i do, papa?
i once felt regret for those that were lost without a trace, but fortunately, we were later able to sense, discover, and preserve them.
then please begin. preparing to access cognitive currents. establishing waypoint...
the vision hunt decree was obviously devised as a means of manipulating the shogun, the ones behind it knowing full well her susceptibility as a puppet with a single-minded focus on eternity.
i will be able to unleash power beyond my limits if i can reverse the process of growth.
clear skies can do nothing to hide the brilliance of lightning. divine bolts can strike even in the absence of rain. do you see that tree? wait... you understand? so... demonstration is not required? good.
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
hehe. i see how it is! so this was all just a bluff. and here i thought you had something to show for it, but it seems you're still far from the truth.
never-changing eternity is the promise i made to my people.
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh...
that's not a ceiling, hook... that's the sky.
once mister florian is awake, please pass on my regards to him. he must be extremely exhausted, to have passed out cold like that.
thanks for standing up for me.
(still, i have to admit that, despite everything...)
don't think of it that way, miss haniyyah. spending time with shroom buddies is actually really fun! right, twirly-whirly?
hmhm! speaking of secret moves, i've prepared some flaming potent tea.
apart from its creator, i fear no one knows how to deactivate it.
you do? good... i mean, it's good to know someone in this world feels the same way as me.
the vast universe and jarilo-vi... how could you ever get tired of such an incredible view.
think about it, is the entrance to your own home that hard to get through?
i'm afraid you have no idea how much she suffered that month.
i've given it some thought, and have decided to shut it down permanently.
first things first, i need to remove the restrictions that the doctor put on me in the akasha...
any organization doing something like that is interested in more than just "mutual aid..."
yay! mister yang is the best!
i think it just might have been, actually. but apparently, he only stayed for half a day before heading back. he's a very busy man.
destination xianzhou, here we come!
no need. "she" is calling me. the time has come.
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
speaking of which, why would there be water here?
(a performance? i've never played a roleplaying game like this before, but even i can tell that suggestion is pretty far-fetched. is a performance check really going to help here?)
ooh, or even: the spina di rosula di simulanka! yeah, that's catchy!
it took longer than i had hoped, and by the time we made it back here, the treasure hoarders and the family were gone...
obviously! wait! why does that seem so ominous...
thank you for the summary, your honor. of course, the gardes' conclusion appeared quite sensible to us at the time.
in the past, we sat in our high chairs in the court, giving our opinions on isolated cases, all while knowing very little about the human stories behind each and every one.
that won't be necessary. i've memorized every detail.
humans long for freedom. if they go for too long without seeing the sky, they get ill... both in body and mind.
i thought that the flow of time was the same on the inside and the outside. so it was a great shock to me when the traveler re-appeared.
oh, really? you mean it?
anyway, what's the plan from here?
you want to use its power? but...
thank you for trying to comfort me, but i can't stop myself from thinking that way.
the statements from both sides, the defenses from attorneys, witness testimonies, and even the audience's emotions will all be projected on the oratrice.
you still remember, right, melus? on that night, it was raining...
when i heard the kids at the clinic talking about this "game," i thought they were just making things up again...
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
i've decided to borrow your body for the time being. please don't blame me. the flora also climbs up the fence to get closer to the sky.
my existence, hmm...
you are unduly concerned. i'm simply conserving my energy.
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means... but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
sorry for the bother. you're too kind.
perhaps, we can think of another way?
not telling yet... we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee...)
it's important to learn to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. you might discover a new interest if you just give it a try.
recognizing that, my father decided to contact the dealers in secret, and cultivate personal relationships with them. finally, he was able to convince someone to become his informant.
...i'm a doctor, not an informant! very well, what's the question?
hehe. before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
...that's an answer i can accept. oleg, what do you think?
it's getting late already, so why don't we stay the night in the fleuve cendre? we can head back to poisson tomorrow.
a time loop... *sigh* you've given similarly wrong answers in the past. a pity.
hehe, that's nice of you.
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
hey, how did you... i--i was just passing by because... i realized i forgot a couple of items on my shopping list!
i applied for vacation... you remembered too, right?
c'est la vie indeed! alas, i am forced to watch on helplessly as a more brave and seasoned adventurer than i swoops in to save the day.
this is what makes ena's dream so powerful. in this paradise governed by the order, everyone indulges in their delightful dreams and lives happily ever after.
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
not exactly. actually, we--
ugh, don't do this to me... hearing half a sentence is like developing half a photo. i'll be up all night thinking about it...
please come this way. let me show you something interesting.
nothing escapes your attention, miss navigator.
...wait, wh--why are you all looking at me? you're not seriously expecting me to fight, are you!?
alright, thank you all. i can do this!
uhh... we're gonna see her right now? can i at least find a place to freshen up first?
but who would launch such an obvious attack? they just want to stir up chaos.
come on, let's head into the city!
well, i say it does. but don't worry! you won't hear any pointless questions from me!
...with how distracted and vulnerable we are, now would be the best time.
i've taken care of your wounds. i'm running short on medical supplies these days though, so behave yourselves and stay away from trouble, you hear me?
i see. so your primary objective -- which has been foiled so far -- was to have a chat with the hydro archon.
huh? isn't that the doctor lady?
should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
this seems like the best spot to do this. we'll need to be quiet so we don't disturb anyone.
still, the ice that trapped me was six-phased ice -- a very rare substance. i don't think you can find it on your average planet...
...yeah. you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
ahaha, yes, ours was as far from a close call as you could get. all it took was a few short, sharp strikes for blitzara and i...
haha... i was just joking. i've been waiting for you.
but after shingo dies, you'll be next.
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine point five!
but the wisdom seelie is truly amazing and freely shares its endless knowledge.
the moon, illusions, and lies... what do they all mean?
...wonderful, that's such a relief.
good morning. we should get going right away. there are too many things in this world that you'll miss if you don't get there on time.
that means this dream belongs to a host who created it.
she's getting better, though, isn't she? it's apparent how hard she's working now.
ah, proof that i boarded the express. the conductor gave me this.
exactly! a--and we even have photos!
kujou kamaji... a descendant of the kujou clan, i presume.
and... thank you, dunyarzad, for organizing the sabzeruz festival for me.
hmm, that actually does feels like something he would say...
ultimately, my duty as the god of wisdom is to guide every form of wisdom to a place where it can find its purpose.
well i'm still me. there is no doubt about that.
oops, that just slipped out. it's actually another line from an immersia...
...then good luck persuading that mass of metal.
hurry, chapter two, let's go. can't you see that satomi is waiting?
you again? what i do with my past is none of your business! why do you have to make things difficult!?
ah, yeah, yes, that's exactly right! please keep it a secret for me.
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us...
after all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. it would be a pleasure to train with you.
thus, the current situation is that our fatui antagonist is still at large, has the two rogue commissions wrapped around their finger, and is distributing delusions from the shadows...
but our mission at yae publishing house is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. it would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
...or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
uhh, you wait here. i'm gonna get your comrades to help you.
you're all marechaussee hunters too, right? allow me to introduce myself! the name's navia -- monster hunter by trade and helpful neighborhood businesswoman on the side.
no, no need. you don't have to call me boss, just "navia" is fine!
this is just a stage name... i guess?
wow, you guys are efficient! now, let's go hang 'em up in the sky!
you made it... i thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
a habit? oh, i see.
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
if i'm not wrong, the knights of beauty also received an invitation from the watchmaker, right?
but as the victor, i acknowledge your honor
there's a difference between memories that arise from lived experiences and those that are implanted into the mind. perhaps it has something to do with time.
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
it's a shame they're too young to board the express. still, your stories of space adventures always put a smile on their face.
i won't deny, the offer on the table is a very tempting one... and if we refuse, belobog will not only have the burden of a huge debt -- we may also incite the wrath of a very powerful force...
is it true that hilichurls grow stronger from eating sunsettias? surely it should be some sort of meat, at least?
(no, it's not the best time to do that...)
is that a dragon!?
w--well. your denial is very strident, i'll give you that! but what proof do you have to back your claims?
the express has faced all kinds of obstacles on its journey -- today is just another one. it's no reason to stop trailblazing.
*sigh* but, there's no point in me studying at the akademiya if i keep relying on this mysterious phenomenon...
i'm fine. it's just...
sure, but don't push yourself. if you start feeling unwell, come straight back and tell me.
a club just for fighting... who knew undergrounders had such brutal hobbies.
there's nothing but... a jigsaw puzzle here.
poor guy. he was seriously injured and was all wrapped up in bandages to keep his good looks safe. if that's the case, then he couldn't have made it through the goldhammer residence's facial recognition system.
well, here we go again... ready?
exactly. i still don't have much solid proof, but i can sense that the other side has already begun to act.
you've all done your part! just leave the rest to me.
please allow me to present to you my most sincere gratitude.
aha! there we go!
i must know what really happened. was my father coerced? framed? even if he really did kill his friend, i must get to the truth.
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so... wanna come with us?
yeah. it takes time for friends to get to know each other properly, and come to trust each other.
uh... ahem, hello one and all. i couldn't help but overhear your conversation just now...
but now that his name has been cleared, and the town is also being rebuilt, i thought this would be the perfect chance to actually realize this dream.
i must be prepared for anything. if there are more formidable monsters lying in wait in this area, i must make sure i have the strength to face them.
it really is nothing major, i stand by that. oh, but since you're so curious, let's have him relate the story one more time, just for you.
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
you might be able to remain stony-faced if you really try, but with your tail swishing behind you... hehe, it tells everything.
we've found it... apep, the dendro dragon.
yeah, it was all me!
*sigh* that's a long story... ever since he was little, vache had always wanted to develop a medicine called "blizzard immunity."
we have an emergency on our hands. please notify everyone here that while they can continue to discuss their dreams, they mustn't try to visit or recreate the locations and scenes that they have been experiencing in them.
with that thought, there is only one choice: let the bloodhounds send him back home! this person deserves to be punished!
has anyone seen what it actually looks like? or what kind of a person it is?
(perhaps today will be the day that he finds some answers.)
i believe i now understand the situation.
i don't. i've never seen such slates.
family... huh, weird.
i hope that the new six great sages will be more focused on academics. sumeru needs such leaders more than ever.
i think, deep down, you realize this. people who show up in your life don't just evaporate like water drops and leave nothing behind. there is no such thing as "balancing the books."
i have no questions about the case, but i'm just curious... how did sparkle manipulate you?
wait! hold on!
but this is definitely not a bad thing. even from the beginning, i've been planning to shut it down.
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit... they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
very good. and murata?
please take dulphy back to her place to rest. i'll sing the finale.
*sigh* velite just left the express too -- he looked really upset. i guess he didn't know what argenti was thinking, either...
however, if you're the dream's host and you become aware that you're dreaming, when you imagine gold and mora on the plate...
pretty impressive... so if we encounter any problems, we'll know who to turn to for help~
(next up... i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm... he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
that took long enough. now then, if everyone would lend me their attention.
as for me... during this time, i'll be out of town.
ahem, yeah... but to go up against yunli is quite impressive, you know? that aura of heroism and grace. it almost makes me want to learn xianzhou swordplay!
two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span... in and of itself, that's very unusual.
the monster gave the heart of water to the kitten, telling him: "the foxes have decided. you are the one who must be sacrificed. take this, quench the flames, and die for your fox kin."
we're a little early. i've got an idea...
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony... looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
but now... i just want to sit down, zone out, and watch the people coming and going... and let the day just pass me by...
this body has no need of rest. but i am an assistant to the one within. if she wishes to rest, i must follow her will.
thank you, captain. we'll take it with us.
oh yeah, sorry -- you must be the fairy of the forest of blessings, right?
easy now, layla. all that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. the bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
then, all you have to do is repeat the correct answer in your mind. as long as i'm able to see you, then i'll be able to hear your answer.
(wait, something seems to be off here...)
...through patting yourself on the back!?
whoa... she sounds like a big deal.
...ugh, didn't i tell you? all our negotiations end in combat!
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
clorinde is right, though. you really are reliable!
give up, furina. there's no point in holding out...
so instead, i had hat guy here help me keep an eye on things.
#({m#the rope that held the water tank up was lit by the fireworks and snapped. as such, the focus here is on the water and not the tank.}{f#the rope that strung the water tank up was lit by the fireworks and cut. as such, the focus here is on the water and not the tank.})
no... we shouldn't... i think we should agree to the meeting.
...what!? that run-of-the-mill, huh?
the way that everyone, including me, has forgotten everything about forbidden knowledge may very well be due to her restoration of irminsul.
yes. i didn't mention it just now, but do you remember when i told you that the power in the crystal is very similar to mine, yet also different?
recording and comparing data will be much easier now that we have this device. i can do it all on my own, too.
hmm? is it a serious matter? maybe you'll... need our help in hunting down the borisin?
wait, we're starting already!?
we made it! from here, we can head to the space station's victory zone. hmm... the atmosphere doesn't seem to have changed much -- doesn't have that tournament vibe.
so, i only hope that justice will be served in this matter. don't overthink it... i'll go find someone to arrange the meeting...
nothing. i suddenly want some fried tofu.
seele has been like this since she was little -- impulsive and eager to be the best. for people who don't know her, they might find her... difficult...
...well, anyway -- if sachin's chosen successor hadn't been able to handle his research, or if it had brought pain to more people, he would have intervened at a suitable moment.
hehe, it's just a hobby. there's no need to praise me for it like that.
that's right. making mistakes is part of growing up.
we don't want anyone else to lose their life to the sea.
i understand your concerns, but... i'm sorry. i just don't have anything to tell you.
(hey! you don't know if you don't try!)
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
for all the things the akademiya did to me, and for all the folly it committed in the name of wisdom... as their archon, i will make them pay!
hmm? as am i. i'm not joking at all.
*sigh* come now, was i not just at the opera house in person? leave these kinds of things to neuvillette.
because other than me, there's only one person left.
i heard you won against the unstoppable hardy two-blades... but you don't seem too happy about it. how come?
that's a lot of information to take in. sorry, both of you -- i know you're in a hurry, but i need a moment to think.
haha, why are you bringing this up all of a sudden? seriously... alright, alright, i'll remember your requests.
peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while...
(huh? she sounds a little hesitant.)
hey, come now, everyone... please don't stare at me as if i was a liar...
okay... why?
a little bit of sugar and a good view really go a long way for relaxation.
i can't see anything fishy... did kafka lay a trap for us? let's get diting to investigate.
such is the fate of us nameless, i suppose.
this is how penacony fell under the family's control. since the arrival of the harmony, the land of the exiles has undergone dramatic changes, not all of which have proven... beneficial.
such is the herta company culture...
unlike anywhere else, irminsul's inner region consists exclusively of torrents of information. you must put aside your differences and be extremely careful as you navigate your way through.
i'm in today. but that is not an excuse for misbehavior.
while that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
ah, i know what this is! it's an advertisement for a home-use object finder.
i see. yes, she's always had great analytical skills. it'd be nice if she was more confident, though.
i would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
haha... sorry about that, i'm a bit prone to nostalgia. don't mind me...
i feel much more at ease knowing that i have it with me. i had thought that it would also help me calm my nerves in sumeru city.
i would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
that's why i could only give you very subtle hints and some suggestions. long story short, i'm really sorry i had to keep you guessing.
from a purely technological perspective, it's a commendable achievement indeed. it's no exaggeration to say this is the culmination of human wisdom.
i never enjoy leftovers that have been left too long. it just feels like sacrilege to neglect the poor food when it's fresh, then eat after it's gone stale...
hey, that's not the only reason i'm here! we mostly just needed a walk to clear our heads.
let me think... what spell does lady kitsune teach to the protagonist? ...ah, i've got it!
unbelievable, to think that there would be... remnants of the order on penacony.
perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
"uhhh! umm... ummm..."? your brother is your closest relative. you must have noticed straight away when he started acting out of character.
yes. more precisely, it's right below.
(i never imagined that it would hurt so much...)
(...it felt good to be back on the stage again.)
yes, true. hm, that reminds me, i wonder how far along the akademiya is with their god creation plan...
i'm yae miko, a light novel editor -- purely out of personal interest, and right now, what i'm most interested in is you... nice to meet you. the pleasure is all mine.
"consider the effort you put into thinking and searching as your payment for my knowledge."
i said relax, there's no need to go treading on eggshells. do you really think the eternity i pursue is something that can be shaken by dango and milk?
that was my first time seeing you in battle... you've got some moves, don't you? no wonder you were able to save the underworld.
yes, that's exactly who i'm talking about! so, after the case, she was finally willing to talk to me, and she told me that she wanted to join the spina too.
but for the moment, our top focus should still be figuring out what the sages are up to and what they're planning.
yes, i better think about aventurine's proposal.
that's more like it. ah, one more thing...
uh... y--you're starting to make me feel nervous...
the sun feels almost as hot as those studio lights i'm in front of all the time... good thing there can only be one sun.
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge...
but, i wanna get to know my four shroom buddies a little better and prepare for the qualifiers, so... i'll go do some training now!
got it. he was just worried about me. relax, silver wolf. you know me.
i shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, onodera. please take the opportunity to have a good rest. after all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
mister yang, you're smart. what happened just now!?
sunglasses are great at keeping the sand out of your eyes so you can see your way! except at night... then you can't see anything at all...
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
*sigh*... you're both impossible. go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
as an observer, i get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
things are getting more amusing by the second.
but those things... are all in the past.
(this time... i will protect you.)
but after the momentary numbness subsided, i found that my body was absolutely unscathed.
and now... they get to meet the people they cherish in their dreams again, and the people feel more real than anything a regular dream could hope to create.
oh, please! it's pretty clear they're not talking about you...
mm-hmm. after observation, i know this kind of behavior motivates people... but why is that?
so... you mean to say... your father intended to die in the duelists' ring?
i advanced all the way to the semifinals.
you just want us to buy your things! this is extortion!
kamera operator? that can be a pretty technical job, and it directly affects the final quality of the film. are you really up to it?
but considering it now, it's almost certain that they belonged to a third person at the scene. with one extra person, we'll also need to reconsider why the two shots were fired.
...it was quite frightening indeed. i only wish that everything that just happened was a bad dream.
hee-hee, i've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious...
sure. you can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
let's go, i'll take you to the safe zone~
in my opinion, there is no murderer for this case.
spray can? that's... rough.
well hello there, young ones. what brings you to the shrine? it just so happens that i have a wonderful novel here. i highly recommend it.
would our world become the same if the forbidden knowledge was allowed to rampage across teyvat...?
the encounter at the dreamscape hotel was a sign.
no chance? hey, are you trying to crush my confidence? i'm the kind of girl who performs better when i'm showered with praise, just so you know.
well, what are you waiting for, little one?
maybe it's because she left home early she realizes that dreams, while enchanting, are ultimately just that -- dreams.
how many "today"s has it been? is it possible that "today" will be followed by "yesterday"? does "tomorrow" truly exist as anything beyond a made-up concept?
ugh, aren't you supposed to be dependable?
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers... i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
"born into abject sorrow, he shall now become the loom of fate."
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
the delusions... they're still on your mind, aren't they?
...when i traveled around inazuma with you, i caught a glimpse of how the nation has progressed over the centuries. a glimpse of human potential. everything far exceeded my expectations.
but how long can your will remain strong?
we're truly sorry for what happened... but this is not the end of the story, right?
...right after we finished chatting with topaz in the museum.
that's a nice idea, paimon... but i'm from the rtawahist darshan. the kind of information i'm gathering now would only be of any use to someone in the amurta darshan.
no need to thank me. it's a doctor's duty to heal.
alright, but there are doors all over the place... which one should we choose...? do you have any idea, misha?
i have nothing more to say to them.
it really is her... miss robin!
let's split up here. i'm going to check on what's happening with the spina -- you know how it is. there's some things you just need to be there for yourself.
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm... i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
fear not, unless i wipe away your memories, forgetting me is not an option~
the strife engraved upon a gnosis... you're talking about the archon war.
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while...
it's not good to be overly obsessed with dreams. all it'll do is fill up your mind and eat away at your thoughts.
you seem like a pretty important person. what brings you to this kind of place?
now that i think of it, i don't think i've ever actually listened to my own inner voice...
it will be easier for us to start with someone from inazuma.
aaah! ugh, i should have covered my ears when i saw the flash!
not at all. as long as you have different kinds of sauces in, you can have macaroni and tomato sauce one week, macaroni and bolognese the next...
uh... what's going on?
don't look at me like that. i've never had to tinker with the shogun before, and she's very complicated. it's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
(and why are there so few people around here? where did everyone go?)
all the people he created also turned into monsters, including emira.
the singer, epsilon's superstar... if i can stop one heart from breaking. that's your song, isn't it?
don't go charging into the fragmentum again. mister fersman heard about what you did and came to me to find out what happened.
you already know that this isn't your first sabzeruz festival, don't you?
very good, paimon. using analogies well is an excellent habit to get into.
good! seeing you so full of energy makes me less nervous, hehe.
dango with milk... hmm, i've never heard of it. what made you want to do this?
huh? ah, i don't quite understand what you're trying to say...
a punchline with a straight face -- i suppose that's your specialty.
yes, however... if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
it's really easy -- see this chandelier? next... we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
anyway uh... when did i come here last? i don't seem to remember.
let me get some aideen tokens for you. with those, you'll be able to try any of the attractions here that you fancy.
miss sparkle also used it to attack mister shamari.
i will review your final thesis myself. i am expecting great things from you, mister hat guy.
looks like yinshu isn't here after all... where could she be?
the fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise... they would have been purged long ago.
uh, pitch-dark hook the great, where is the fight club? can you show us the way?
...so this is the certification mark?
let's give it a shake! nice, it's still fizzy and has a long shelf life!
(...oh, wait! we're supposed to be roleplaying. i should stay in character.)
this place is... complicated. it's quite unlike the tea house in your memories.
little white houses, plants exclusive to the desert climate... hmm... okay, i think i've got it.
and these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
thank you. i don't have any further questions.
there goes my plan to turn the whole place upside down, i guess.
...you're right. there can be no forgiveness for the crimes he committed. he didn't deserve the title of "doctor."
welcome to reality. more specifically, the reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
but i barely felt the time passing by.
it took me a lot of effort to find it, you know... i don't think anyone's used it in, like... a hundred years?
what's going on... how come we're back at the start?
we should be close. this is the way i came when i first traveled to sumeru city.
judging by its features, i can tell from the moment it sprouted, it'll never be able to bloom.
"the stars exploded, and the express has to go everywhere to pick up all the pieces, and that's why it flies up in the sky."
he's committed an act that affected the safety of sumeru. after he wakes up, i'll inform the general mahamatra of all the details.
*sigh* but the beds here are so nice!
but their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. for example...
i'll definitely be putting in a few words next time we meet yukong...
let's go. it's time for them to learn director aurelie's final thoughts.
(the vase was not broken by chance. it was used to cover important evidence -- the water!)
is this... anything to do with kafka?
huh...!? isn't svarog wildfire's sworn enemy?
family... right! the hydro fungus left behind its family.
or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? who knows, maybe i'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
i was actually hoping you'd give yanqing some praise!
refund! immediately!
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
it's a bit difficult to imagine someone using their own money to hunt down themselves...
whew, this cyber swordplay is amazing...
he was, but not anymore.
what a pity... i thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. but alas. the time has come prematurely.
there's only one way to find out -- let's go ask. i've always found ipc staff easy to talk to.
"the fox you gave me is very beautiful, miss shrine maiden, but i still love my old friend the most."
i just looked up some tips on the interastral network -- these victory zones are leased by the ipc and the gaming association from various planets. the ipc's reach is impressive...
seems like you're a natural. it's not easy to reach this level of enlightenment.
but it is in this miniscule distance that paths cross, and countless worlds connect. the universe may not remember every person who leaves a tie along the silver rail, but we will.
i'll respect you too if you keep your word.
i don't feel one way or another about collecting, but since it's something you enjoy, i'd like to join in and see what it's like.
spread to the four corners of teyvat!
let's move on to the next stop... uh, i mean-- the last stop. let's go!
you made up the second half, didn't you...?
here we are at last... *sigh* it's sad to say goodbye.
your dad worries about you -- stop giving him reasons to.
yes. only after receiving the blessing of dendro can a person gain the dendro element's dream-enhancing power. that explains the feelings of deja vu.
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
they are similar, but not identical.
we're going to the opposite side, right?
hmm, split up? what do you mean?
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
so how big was it? bigger than the express? bigger than herta space station? no, that can't be right.
...i see. i understand.
do you remember the invite that the express received?
i guess it's time to tell the story of that "mikhail."
thanks to captain gepard, we managed to keep our losses to a minimum. i'm sure people will begin to appreciate the silvermane guards after this battle.
not so long ago, i was still wondering whether i'd ever see belobog's sky again. now, i'm on a train coasting through the universe...
i especially like the head of the club. great character design. she really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. i can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. approved!
well, they weren't in a hurry to make it known. most of the mines have been contaminated by the fragmentum -- many people are out of work. they were afraid of being overwhelmed if they let the word out.
please... must our conversations take such a depressing turn every time we meet?
i used to think i'd never doubt myself, but you could say i've discovered that i'm not as strong as i thought i was.
...but pom-pom said the banquet we were invited to is still a little ways off. hmm... what can i do to pass the time...?
let's talk later. go and find hook, she can't have gone too far...
when people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. sampo's first and second laws of motion.
isn't this an encryption key for the elevator? with this, we should be able to use the elevator to reach the first floor of the storage zone.
--but it wasn't me! the antimatter legion must've broken it!
come on now, time to empty your mind and get a good night's sleep! i'll see you tomorrow~
someone told me they'd just seen you in poisson. i assumed it was a case of mistaken identity, but sure enough, here you are... and furina, too.
of course. i've heard that most humans like desserts, so it's not unusual that i should enjoy them too. miko agrees with me on this.
not to worry! mister giovanni will explain it all, right?
a vessel arrives at a deserted spaceport... isn't that how, like, loads of horror movies start!?
may i have this page to record and draw?
is this... fowl? wait, no, the texture is more like shroomboar...
i see, but when the count reached thirty seconds or so, there was a thud -- one so loud that i believe practically everyone heard it.
but then i'd be just like everyone else out on the streets...
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
the aquabus project was a monumental project that stood to benefit all of fontaine. it would have been a little close-minded to assess or evaluate it only from the perspective of the "clan."
i'm now filled with determination, masters! i'll learn swordplay well and teach that guy a lesson!
i really wish i could spend the whole day talking to her about the old days. but sadly now is not the time.
there's an accounting book lying on the ground. it must have been specially placed there by sparkle.
come now, don't be sad! life is all about optimism! oh, that reminds me, what did you have for breakfast this morning?
but even if forbidden knowledge has been completely removed, its influence still remains, which is why the withering remains even after forbidden knowledge has disappeared.
ah, the weather is lovely and warm. things are about to start getting lively again.
hook has an uncanny ability to rally people to her cause -- both adults and children. it's a skill alright, and forcing her to be well-behaved puts a lid on it.
that guy's really taking it to a whole new level. does he really think he's a superstar or something?
uh... th--this isn't just hide-and-seek, okay? let me explain...
we can still go out in the evening for some grilled fish and drinks, though. bet you there'll be people singing sea shanties too! how does that sound?
you should replace it. then decorate the handle with something you like... maybe some ornaments, fur, or a hard leather wrapping. then, write the names of your children on it.
(all of their wishes actually did come true...)
if you really hate each other, and can't reconcile your differences, then you could just call it quits now. why bother with a final performance if the group is already fractured?
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to... wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
to be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed"... but we did escape.
but we would always get yelled at by the grown-ups if they caught us sneaking into the river to catch fish.
...*sigh* from the sublime to the ridiculous... after all that, everything's come full circle.
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger....
i'm no appraiser, but these two gems look to be high quality.
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be... heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
well done, traveler and paimon.
how about it? can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
yes. that soldier was one of the many thousands who made the ultimate sacrifice. what he was describing just now was precisely the disaster that happened in inazuma five hundred years ago.
whatever the case, it's a very warm feeling.
heh, so you would stick to mister lyney's defense even after knowing what you do now? you certainly have more professionalism than i thought.
*sigh* there are many types of friend... she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
i'm not sad. it's just that... this dream is so loving and forgiving.
where's your sense of loyalty!? uh, that would be nice though...
they've been searching for a way to save you ever since they left their homeland. they yearn for a chance to return home.
my father would run the businesses and expand our reach, while my mother would keep the peace and make sure that everyone was happy. their work made sure that the spina could grow and thrive.
i could tell he was giving himself a lot of pressure, so i gave him a suggestion~
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves...
even though it's been a day, i still break into a sweat when i think about it. our trailblazing expedition almost ended in penacony...
miss acheron, i have a suggestion: why not split up and look for a way out, and meet up again when we find something? that would speed things up.
what? does he look like a crane to you?
thank you for your concern. while i'm gone, i leave the metropole in your capable hands.
you should be proud that you've been able to gather here and look toward the future together.
...no way! i won't let you!
it was even more unstable than i expected.
that when that moment arrives for us to make a choice, the answer to our end will already be within our hearts
well, to be honest, you're the one who tipped us off, paimon.
she seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and... it's related to the watchmaker.
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes... they must have come through here.
(uh... i don't think that's the kind of question we're supposed to ask...)
let's continue with the plan. can you help me with a rehearsal of my thesis defense? we can do that at the house of daena.
alright, it's like this. all we need to do is load the robot onto the mine cart...
yeah, you're right... it's been raining non-stop for a few days now.
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting...
indeed. then perhaps you could tell us everything that happened during that one minute.
i used to enjoy visiting the rainforest... but it's been a while since i've been there. maybe a lot has changed...
warriors of the past who spilled your blood on this land, your noble souls now rest in this earth.
that was a figure of speech, do you understand? nitpicking my turns of phrase, the sheer audacity.
...you've been spending too much time with hook.
what, your point being that they're out of the spina di rosula's league then?
i buried it deep inside one of my own dreams, and then hid it inside an allegorical story so that it wouldn't be altered.
yeah right... anyway, since when did investigators shy away from delicate situations?
please, come to your senses! i'm begging you...
well, that's why i only have one per day...
you can't... you can't argue that just because a divine creation is flawed, that the god behind it must also be no god at all.
i prefer how things are now. i can come and go as i please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
without the sacred sakura, inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
(but what if... what if it's really alright?)
hey, wakey-wakey! you'll get mushrooms growing on your head~
whew, finally... i wrote out my question and put it in the book.
enough with the whispering! could someone please tell me where monsieur neuvillette is, and why i'm standing trial?
hahaha, totally! right on the money, paimon.
hey, don't you understand? you're currently the prime suspect for a major case! this isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
hehe, seems like you've been enjoying yourselves.
by the way, i'm curious. if my pay is so low, then what about our two lead actors? didn't they travel here all the way from inazuma?
it may take some time to find them, so let's wait for a bit.
huh? what's wrong? why aren't you saying anything?
let's go back to town. i still owe those patients an explanation...
find the leader of squad one and tell him to take the wounded resident to see a doctor. he should know where to go.
it's rare that i'm this serious, can't you just humor me for once? sheesh!
so this is where you always meet your wife in your dreams?
she sure did put a lot of work into this gag, and i think we're the punchline.
right. i suppose that's the best news we've gotten today.
okay, that's weird...
woah! what a big bathtub...
you mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. otherwise... you will be cursed with bad luck.
um, this area wasn't guarded the last time i was here... have my frequent comings and goings started drawing attention?
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
why do we have to lie? ...i'm abstaining -- i like telling the truth. but... i get what you're trying to do.
i have no idea what's going on... no wonder this seelie is becoming legendary. let's keep reading the clue.
still, i remember the day he received his offer from the medical academy. my parents took me to the florist and we bought him the most expensive marquise stem in the shop.
even though the city's residents haven't noticed anything strange, if the traveler hadn't broken the sabzeruz samsara, the situation could've become dire.
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
yeah... i can tell people are watching me.
huh? even you're saying that, mister yang? how powerful is that dreammaster?
i was just trying to recall why we came out for a walk.
ah, by that... do you mean as if we were standing on a boat and looking out at the sea? sure, let's give that a try!
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
is this the lesson you learned from your journey in liyue?
himeko and mister yang will be busy with serious research. besides, fossils can't compete with martial contests when it comes to fun, right?
i should be able to purge it with my elemental power.
each year on that day, my parents would give me a bouquet of first snow. the number of stems represented how many years had passed since i joined the family.
moving forward inevitably invites further loss, but also new encounters.
i'm making early preparations for what is to come.
i'll give you a hint. it's to do with the yae publishing house.
ooh, that's a good one, i like it!
monsters! a lot of them, too... why didn't we see them coming?
i felt a bit bad at first.... but, uh, i really did have a lot of stuff, hehe...
hehe... slow down, no need to rush. let me guess.
(i wonder.. if clorinde's master were the champion duelist back then... would that duel against mister callas have gone differently?)
hehe... i assume you're hoping to take back a few moves.
it's natural to want to be over-cautious when dealing with a highly venomous snake, but when all that's left is its skeleton, there's nothing to worry about.
...that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name...
at this time, cowell arrived in the tunnel, having heard that strange noise, and caught lyney red-handed.
(oh, so this is just part of the script... phew... then i can probably relax.)
and whose image do you see, marcel?
thanks. you two should go and rest. this was quite a day, after all.
trust me, you don't want to know the cost of betraying me. just think of the things i said to you as our little secret. understood?
it's a... warp trotter?
hold on, traveler. there's something else we need to discuss.
all very true. an original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. this is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
ah, yes: "true love cannot be controlled by external forces"... little layla's belief is a classic one.
...oh, there you are. sorry, i got distracted watching the crowds.
so, miss topaz, what exactly will it take for the ipc to go easier on belobog?
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
uncle marcel? hmm, my father did really trust him, and they worked together on a large number of projects. maybe that's how he got to know jacques.
anyway, i'm layla, a rtawahist student at the akademiya... for now, at least. i was just looking up some information at the house of daena...
...uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy...
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
the express is... melting?
now comes the tricky part. how do we do it?
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details...
huh? the vidyadhara? you mean these pearls will turn into people?
i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
in the meantime, i expect the takatsukasa clan to continue supporting the kujou clan as before.
just take it easy and leave the monsters to us! fighting them is what we do.
the feeling of cool lake water can wash away all your troubles.
hehe, any other details to share? we've heard that shingo has been behaving rather out of character since then.
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see...
wait, i guess. let's give it some time.
even though you couldn't see it through to the final scene, the audience was very impressed by your performance. it's safe to say that you made your mark on this memorial show.
still, it's got the same stony expression, haha.
(it's too bad that i had to break the one clear rule i'd managed to make for myself... even if i had no choice...)
because she is a god. it's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
not long ago, you witnessed the hydro archon destroy her divine throne, yes?
yes, it does. i always thought that she must have grasped some elusive, arcane wisdom to arrive at the conclusions she did.
that may not sound like a huge difference to you. but it's helped me relax a lot... so don't worry about me.
as much as it pains me, unfortunately, i should just stay put. i'm more like... a damsel in distress more than anything.
don't sweat it -- leave them to us.
...we still don't know how the change to irminsul will affect the senior ranks of the fatui, but in all likelihood, they won't even remember their own harbinger.
aw, come on, i'm really only asking you to finish what you started. besides... your paychecks are still in my hands. heh, heh, heh.
everyone here is living a self-sufficient life... i don't know how to describe it, but this place feels like the real dreamscape...
i almost thought i'd slipped into a fairy tale...
i hope you really give this a good shot, you and haniyyah. the future of this highly entertaining tournament depends on the decisions you make from now on... i'm excited to see what you've got in store for us.
sit back and enjoy the duel.
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
i believe that following someone without their knowledge is actually called "stalking," is it not?
many of you here have been experiencing some beautiful dreams.
ooh, i would love... n--no, no need. that would be needlessly indulgent.
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
we don't have much time... may fate allow us to meet again, knight of beauty.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express...
well of course it is! after all, i am a boss.
that power then enabled him to change what was recorded in irminsul and erase himself, even though he didn't have much strength left.
easy, seele, maybe they can help.
these alluring dreams often portray a scene from real life, which concurs with our previous findings.
good. i'll have someone attend to this shortly.
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
leave it to me. i've watched you rehearse so many times that i've learned clio's part by heart.
oh? well what did you want to ask?
it's enough that i can tell i was once supported by that warmth, and its existence has allowed me to get to where i am today.
i'm sorry, master yanqing, master yunli... i lost...
hmm... what kind of dessert should i try next?
it seems like i've underestimated the popularity of this game. hmm... i suppose this calls for a few more volumes of "king of invokations"...
drat... we're caught right away.
kuroda? what are you doing here?
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market...
then what are we waiting for? let's go grab ourselves the title!
so the one in this photo... are you sure it isn't me?
like fish struggling on land... unable to find a single puddle of fresh water in the entire world...
correct. the akasha is keeping each person's brain in a constant dream state, but also separating their consciousness from their own dream.
changing the information in irminsul changes teyvat.
don't worry about it. take a rest, we'll be back right away.
yeah. i feel like some of the weight has been taken off my shoulders after chatting with tighnari.
well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know i'm actually working to take care of it.
bravo, good show! you certainly live up to your reputation.
...is this treasure really more important to you than bringing peace to the kingdom?
but there is no urgency. to reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be... it doesn't seem to have any info on it...
he did not realize that this sound could be heard by everyone in the opera house, which is why he claimed earlier that he could not hear the sound.
never mind who they are, let's just film them.
the sweet dream's collapse... that memokeeper mentioned the same thing. so, it's real.
phantylia... what is she doing?
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
besides, being a leader is hard. it wasn't the right job for me.
and also... my mind was consumed entirely with the plight of inazuma and the fate of those closest to me.
as she indicates, once i started entertaining the idea of change, i became hostile in her eyes.
but if you still have doubts about ei, i would say they are misplaced.
and now, at long last, i'm not just an observer anymore.
*sigh* it's alright. well, this was supposed to be a farewell meal, so i doubt you have further interest in this business, right?
alright, go and take a look around. there should be a mechanism somewhere that makes the whole room move.
could you... please make an exception? we're not going to cause any trouble.
wait, wait! why does it feel like everyone else knows something i don't?
compared to an interconnected dream, independent individual dreams would be much harder to manage and manipulate.
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
c--completely relax? but we're at a cafe, is this not relaxing enough...?
after all, they can't distinguish which human behaviors are hostile or not, and it'd already be too late for them once humans have drawn their weapons.
things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.
hehe, far from it, haniyyah. i know full well how serious you are about all this from your iron-clad determination to annihilate an entire species... how would i ever dare mock you?
you're awake, lazy bug. looks like you had a nice dream.
ah, time for a break. i'd really like a berry & mint burst... if you get one for me, i'll tell you a couple of stories about the sun. okay?
all the members of the spina greatly respected her wish, so no matter what i did as a child, they were happy to humor me.
reserved? really?
good. you were out for a while, i was beginning to worry. you were saying some strange things.
when i touched the doctor to confirm whether he'd eliminated all his segments, i read this memory in his mind. you have to admit, it must be the truth.
she runs a regular q&a column in "that's life" magazine. the people of inazuma absolutely adore her.
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
hehehe, have you never heard of the spina di rosula?
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii...
it also reminded me... on the day that the incident happened with my father, it was raining outside, and we found some clothes left at the scene...
when are you going to get started? i can help with the sewing, too.
wait, don't tell me you never...! ah, this is all my fault. it's not too late to cover your ears! here, partner, i'll do it for you!
i was originally looking up some information at the house of daena, but the more i read, the more i realized that my thesis is horribly lacking.
hold on, sir... we have documents authorized by the family that would aid your investigation. if it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this mister gallagher?
do you mean... you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
exactly. gallagher suggests that the real traitor is someone else... probably within the oak family.
maybe, but the ones outside just seem like a waste of energy.
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
this question... surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us...
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again...
...forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
the atmosphere in this room feels totally different.
...th--the sampo hotel? this is goethe hotel!
huh, what do you mean?
ah, valid point. i overlooked that part. i was just thinking about leveraging a person's desire for sleep.
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
you and my father are truly alike. you'd keep all kinds of things in your heart, and never say a word to anyone.
take this one for example: "the good thing about being reincarnated as a hilichurl is that i only need to eat sunsettias to become stronger"...
well, guess i'll keep it then!
her power was already on the decline. then you dealt her that fateful strike.
we could ask you the same thing.
wait a minute -- clear my head of what!?
but once you're discharged from the fortress again, you're welcome to pay another visit to poisson.
finally! the rain has stopped!
i'll head into the city shortly to start my own search. i'll see you later.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
we not only need to limit the number of stars, but we may also need to consider the degree of shift when applying triple-orbit shift algorithms...
imagination means breaking through what you perceive as normal.
yes, those can wait until we're back in real life.
the truth is... we are on the same side.
wait a minute, now i'm a little confused. are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
even if i had that kind of power, i wouldn't dream of abusing it. i assure you, the dried fruits and pastries i brought are quite ordinary.
i'm not entirely sure what it all means. maybe mister gallagher can shed some light on it?
i suppose... pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
since my physical form is here in this realm, i suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.
hey! there are still wounded here that need our help!
many things have changed now that inazuma is at peace. however... it seems that some people continue to fear the "divine light" just as before.
(the mechanic answered: "niwa fled this place for fear of punishment, but he left you a gift. he said it's the one thing that you've been looking for... he took it straight from the chest of one of his innocent servants.")
(there sure are a lot of people here to see the trial, and they all seem to be oddly... excited about something. i even know some of these people.)
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
thank you for being so willing to help in a moment of crisis like this. you don't know how much it means to me... i really... can't express how grateful i am.
you may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. i thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
pedrush, is there anyone here who's experiencing a marvelous dream right now?
i learned something new today... i never knew that the hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
oh, hey there. it's been a while, hasn't it? what have you two been up to?
that's the first time anyone's said that to me.
but the memory zone up ahead... appears to be severely twisted. be careful, everyone.
and then he runs to the dock and picks up some luggage?
oh, wait, let me check if i have all the ingredients... *sigh* melus and silver used to take care of tasks like this.
no way! not even close!
our minds have connected several times before. there is a corner of your heart reserved for an intense longing... a feeling of being all alone in the dark, searching for the one candle whose light still burns.
...of course, i don't know the whole story behind why the architects ordered the lockdown. who knows, thanks to you, they might finally be about to lift it... something that wildfire's wanted to achieve for a long time now.
that's right, we'd never sell out our friend!
it seems only the fire seed or apep's heart of oasis can save them.
hey, look at all these chips scattered everywhere...
i have high hopes, though. this seems like miko's style, so i'm sure the stories are very entertaining.
ugh, what is going wrong?
this is precisely why when entering the plane of euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
i'll come back tomorrow to check on it. don't worry about me if you have other things to do.
*sigh* sorry for causing you so much trouble...
you don't "protect" people by imprisoning them.
just as i expected, it seems my guess was correct.
but even the tea that is most bitter to the tongue, once swallowed, leaves some sweetness in the throat.
"mirror-me"... wh--what do you wish to say?
but thankfully, he rarely talked to me about complex matters, and thus understood little of me as a person. in this case... he really didn't need to give me an easy way out.
the engineer is still doing a few routine safety checks. we can head out as soon as we get the green light!
hahaha... that blasted stubborn fool, i was right to put my faith in him. i'm so glad i didn't give up on the case all those years ago...
illustrious names? ...uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
i just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
it's been too long, mom... too long.
haha, but seeing as you stumbled upon me, you aren't far from finding that person now.
he has his own goals... and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
i believe the story was called "the true heart of darkness: secret tales of the yellow rose."
i'm at your service. i will not disappoint.
a friend. we, um... i'm having a little trouble with my thesis, and we happened to be passing by...
(given his breadth of knowledge on both academic and worldly matters, there's no way he hasn't heard about what happened in fontaine...)
sorry, i might have been too presumptuous.
ahh, but i guess i'm exaggerating a bit... most of it is still due to the help of some unknown person, rather than my own work... hehe...
our residents are hard at work as well. thanks to everyone, work is progressing nicely. we've lost a lot of people, but we're moving forward -- that will have to be enough.
oh... am i understanding this correctly? a masked fool, inviting me to work together?
don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
...is that really the main takeaway from all this?
heh, well, our funds have been a little tight lately...
wow, look at the carved ice! it feels perfect for this city, somehow.
yeah! think about all the people suffering in the capital or all those guards who got hurt fighting the monsters... wouldn't it be better if we gave the treasure to them?
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
hmm... quite impressive.
recover those cherished recollections and enshrine them in a land of purity. in doing so, all will be preserved from true oblivion.
hmm, i'm a little worried about him. i hope he can find a way to cheer up soon.
blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. you're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
a gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. hehe... don't you agree?
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
i just wanted to be another drop in the water, not the cold and restrictive container.
heh... hehe... miko, i never thought i would have the chance to meet with you like this again.
it's extremely precious to me. ever since i was little, i would always carry it with me whenever i'm doing something important.
i never thought... you'd use that kind of rhetoric against me...
he entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. if that's the case... he should have seen everything that happened here...
are you two... *gasp* the people in dark clothing? what's with the wardrobe change?
fine, fine, i suppose haste is warranted. lead the way!
looks like you've forgotten -- there is a memokeeper girl in front of the express' shattered mirror.
because i don't think so.
haha, that won't be necessary -- i can't imagine march reacting well if her camera went missing. besides...
it looks like he really has no intention of imprisoning us. if it's just a quiz, i suppose it's fine to humor him.
hehe, it felt like he learned a lot from me. then again, everyone has a lot to learn from me, hee-hee~
who knows? i mean, we are the champions!
this is mister jiaoqiu, the healer working for the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
wow... i didn't expect to find a place like this in the underworld!
as for the girl in the silvermane guard uniform, i told sampo to watch her... but it seems that he left his post and she made a run for it.
come on, neuvillette. there's no need to repeat all the unimportant legalese.
haha, kind-hearted as usual. it's just...
my brother does wear an identical necklace... do you know him?
staying vigilant wasn't the issue... it was the not knowing whether i'd ever be able to let my guard down again...
but from the whispers of the residents, i've heard a familiar name... gallagher.
that aside... there were also my personal motives. i wished to travel with you as firefly... and not sam.
alright! let's move out!
don't worry. i... i will keep hope alive for everyone until the very end.
it's open! oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, dunn!
(phew... i don't think i let anything slip today. i must show the people that there is nothing to worry about...)
well... i might be totally off base here, but i think there's something fishy with this tv.
i will never forget you, and all that you did for inazuma.
huh!? there's someone else here? ugh... this is so unsettling! i can't see anything!
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
i know you have many questions... do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme...
this one is a little bit complicated... i have to put on my thinking cap.
oh, interesting! i wasn't thinking about it like that. i suppose it's not so different from an acting troupe, everyone has their own role to play.
since the physical body will eventually turn to dust, she replaced hers with that of a puppet.
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
and soon, you'll also begin your journey anew, and depart from sumeru.
i'm gonna need more practice. i can feel myself getting flustered, and i start to stumble whenever i'm asked questions that i'm unfamiliar with.
would "the seelie" be willing to help me this time? what is it actually thinking? i really have no idea...
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent... and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
yeah, but that was before the robbery. i was just passing through...
the fact won't change that they existed in my life, and gave me the reason and motivation to move forward.
why is that surprising? playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and i was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
miss topaz is definitely up to the job! she has that aura of... what's the word... invincibility!
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
ugh! what, are you reading my mind now!?
no, no, what i meant to say is, shouldn't you remember us from a few days ago? we were at the trial of the great magician lyney.
th--then, may i ask some questions? in my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things...
i wasn't counting on running into other contestants here... maybe this is the end of the road for me. twirly-whirly on its own is no match for you...
i'm so glad haniyyah has finally worked things out...
i think i'll start by doing a loop around the competition zone...
yeah, that's right. callas and navia are self-explanatory, while clementine was the name that my mother went by.
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
thank you for your words of comfort. you make a very good point.
can i drink half now and save the other half for later? just in case skott beats me, i can use it to recover...
in that case, my dear audience, let's allow the joy of victory to steep for a little while longer, haha.
we'll be making some preparations first. just be sure to let us know if they start revealing lyney's tricks. thanks!
do you have any tips for dealing with that?
yeah... luckily, we were just in time...
...julian? quick, let's go see!
tea parties are a must for the well-mannered. if you'd like to learn the proper etiquette, i'd be happy to teach you.
so, how long am i going to have to play this role?
florent, i'll leave the town to you. summon the other members and help with the evacuation of the townspeople.
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing... he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency...
whoa! what a stroke of good luck!
(phew. the maison cardinalice has announced my accession, but this is my first time facing the people...)
you can use your real name too, if you want. i do that whenever i get too lazy to think of a new name.
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
rather than hearing endless explanations, would you like to experience it for yourself?
why don't they sell soulglad in this bar? did something happen?
my mind feels exhausted, even though i haven't done too much thinking. what is going on?
thanks, traveler and paimon. she seems to have finally accepted the truth, but i think she'll still need a long time to come to terms with her feelings.
whoa! they really have thought of everything. even the fateometer is here and ready to go for us!
instead of resorting to such despicable methods!
i know! he must have found a treasure map at spare time book shop. he went into the alley to dig it up and then went home with his newfound riches!
i suppose you're going to tell me anyways...
i can't believe that happened to miss robin... "the strong defending the weak" is a great mantra, but if i had to pay such a price... i, i don't know what i'd do...
yes... i have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.
today they do! and you're not dreaming. if you don't believe us, pinch yourself!
(huh? does that mean hu tao also knows...!)
are you bored, welt? i understand... but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
oh, really? but i don't want to take up your time...
how fascinating... you must be full of secrets. there's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
hmm... dan heng, how long can humans live for?
how about we start with your name? now, should we call you misha? or...
don't be ridiculous, luka. still, whatever your motivation was, i hope you can find a different outlet for it.
anyway, now that the case has finally been solved, perhaps it will slowly begin to fade from the public consciousness.
which means... seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
it's a relief to see you safe and sound, miss robin.
greetings, gentlemen! are we being invited for afternoon tea?
where's the input interface? ah, found it...
anyway, we should confirm that first, just to be sure.
*sigh* i heard that many were injured in the clashes, so i hurried over here to see if i could help.
this ring is a piece of evidence, right?
uncle marcel, you've also noticed that other thing, right? the fact that humans can dissolve in water...
what? i can pack it myself, you know...
my original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. but then i ran into miss hu tao and mister zhongli, and well, you know the rest. i suppose it was meant to be.
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
mm-hmm. even though different creatures have varying habits and ways of communicating, the emotions we experience are all the same.
ugh, you're such a nuisance! just what crime are we supposed to have committed again? it better be worth you following us all the way out here!
if only there was a way for me to preserve this moment and show it to the kids back home.
ah, the opera's about to start. toodles!
so the answer is not everything. people yearn to find the truth and then conquer the troubles they face.
a compliment!? continue...
yes. the youkai called their celebration the "mikawa flower festival." makoto and i attended it once... she found it particularly fascinating.
the "script" hasn't reached its end yet -- we will meet again!
...what's he talking about?
it's easy to guard against and deceive a single, narrow perspective. a shift in thinking is required at such times in order to produce a breakthrough.
as the second-in-command at tatarasuna, responsibility for what had happened fell to mikoshi nagamasa.
i can't believe it, but in the end, no one was disappointed in me. what a relief.
hmm? but the competition isn't over yet... oh, layla, layla... she's really a bundle of nerves, isn't she?
no, you were motivated above all to create a hyper-realistic "person"... the desire to reconnect with a "real" loved one is the one shared sentiment between all our dreamers.
although i have some understanding of the situation already, it could take an unexpected turn at any time.
no matter how long it takes, i am committed to bringing this to fruition. this is my promise.
if it's only a few games... by all means.
twirly-whirly and the other shroom buddies were way stronger than i thought. before i knew it, they'd knocked the opposition out...
just tell him the palais mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. he shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
(every nation kirara visited had a parcel sent to sumeru...)
save it. you saw us in there and got scared, so you pulled a runner.
let me be honest... do you really think you have what it takes to shoot a film?
hmph... who gave you that idea? was it the knave? you'd sink so low as to use a harbinger's words against me?
spices supreme... check out that sign. here it is!
(oh, sure.)
hook, you look very happy. did something good happen?
whether it's studying, or even just life in general... there are so many things i have yet to get the hang of.
they changed into plain clothes, and came to the opera house as regular audience members, waiting for the perfect opportunity to incite insurrection against you.
i never knew you could do this.
"...all these spaces are empty except for the occasional ones that contain mute puppets rather than people... i can't sense any human presence..."
oh my, i'm human and so are you. can you get a grip...
you can use the same room as last time. you still remember the room number, yeah?
but this... this is so... cruel. i don't want to forget you!
the traces... where did they go? is diting malfunctioning?
wakening... which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
"stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation"... what a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it...
their confusion and fear are lucid to me... but i also remember they chose never to give up -- just like miss robin.
oh? it appears that you have more skill than i thought.
we can ask jessie for help! i've gotten to know many locals while waiting for you guys.
so that's why you took the stars... because you missed your mom.
anyway, the opinion of the clinic is that none of you have come to harm.
yes. the truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, baal and beelzebul.
well, i'm not as fortunate as she is. even if i'm a memokeeper, i was still influenced by the power of the order and fell into hallucinations.
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
i think i can handle things from here. you don't need to stay here if you find it boring. you're here to have a good time, after all.
let's go! i can't wait to finally get back above ground!
i used to think just like that samurai... that i was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
mm-hmm. three familiar faces should be enough for setaria.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
so, who is he talking to? do you know anything about it, misha?
we will have to end the frivolities there. there is much work to be done.
all i know is that it's the foundation of the sacred sakura, and from what i have heard it's a little different from ei's "plane of euthymia."
you didn't come here for sightseeing, right? did you find any leads?
i can see... she once walked in the rain, once burned in battle, and once held the cold ashes in her hands -- in a way completely different from mine.
we are all in a dream. it isn't that the people of sumeru don't dream. rather, the akasha is taking their dreams from them.
let's go. the venue for this meeting is in the kanjou commission headquarters up there. the view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
then... how did they turn against each other?
you really expect me to know the answer to that?
well, we've walked far enough for now. let's take a break!
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy...
it's the least we could do. as long as you live in poisson, even if you're not an official member, you're still part of the family.
i think seeing emira turn into a monster was punishment enough for him.
which brings me to why i'm here... i thought you should probably know that not everyone here is ready to forgive and forget after the hydro archon's inaction in the face of catastrophe.
in any case, i'm pretty sure the tea you bought is this region's specialty. what is it called again... ah, neuvillette even mentioned it earlier...
but i did have the chance to think some more about that thing that was weighing on my mind, and i realized something.
supposedly, everyone who's been pranked by the seelie had angered it in some way...
so you made me go through all this effort to repair junjun just so you could sell him...?
wait, what's going on...?
this time we're playing the role of a real detective... but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
...and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
yes. for the longest time, i couldn't bring myself to face the pain of that loss.
haha. i like that answer.
you gathered a crowd, prepared a stage, and made sure that the champion duelist would be immediately ready for a fight...
so he paid for the book and tore off the title page to protect people from the spoiler...
(who knew clorinde had such an interesting past... i never had the chance to ask her about it before.)
hahaha, nice one, partner! spectacular improvisation skills -- i'd expect no less from you!
evening, jessie! uhm... is it evening?
you look troubled... is there something you need to tell me?
and the "original sin" cast down on the people of fontaine by celestia, as recorded on the stone slates...
get ready. looks like another fight is about to begin...
so, i have to pick someone and clear them of "interference"?
*sigh* it's been way too long since i last visited home...
hmm, yes. this is a change in the person himself.
what's happening? the ground's shaking... is it an earthquake?
still remember what i taught you? feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then... get close to it.
huh!? but wasn't it working fine for all the days before?
precisely. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
he cast aside his physical form in order to etch the memories of rage and sadness deeper into his being.
traveler, paimon, i really appreciate all your help!
"thank you for your letter. though i have extended a response, i cannot answer your query due to your questionable motives."
let's go, you two! we've got to act fast. ms. coralie, please take adele to the ship...
who are those two little guys?
huh? what makes you say that? is there something off about me?
that's right. compared with these sweet and beautiful dreams, our warnings of danger are dull and emotionless... it looks like the situation will inevitably spiral out of control.
in that case, i'll go order for us first. please wait here a moment.
don't panic, this is how dreams work.
well, if you insist... alright, i understand.
when the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
oh, no, i was just thinking about... how those nobles must be so cold-hearted. it's like they don't care about their people at all!
even though the filming process proved to be extremely challenging, everyone provided valuable and unique contributions to the final product. thank you all for your dedication and support!
dainsleif had memories implanted into his mind... could it be that it's happened more than once?
the discomfort i was experiencing earlier was caused by the shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
is that all you care about!?
so... what's the special connection between you and the player, then?
we've got no wine with us, but let's still toast with water! in celebration of this moment!
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
he came about as a byproduct of creating the shogun. perhaps it's because i feel like i owe him something, but i do not wish to assert control over him.
are you two okay? it seems the news hit harder than i expected.
of course we wanna help... we care about other people too y'know.
that's quite the gamble, dainsleif... but i believe that i am the one walking into a trap laid by the twilight sword.
hehe, that's exactly what i thought when i got her letter.
by the way, dan heng... this time, you'll be taking a stroll with us on the luofu, right?
in penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes... that includes me. i can't deny this, nor do i seek forgiveness.
in the end, we still came full circle.
there's no point questioning or suspecting me. you're the iudex, but you're still my subordinate -- you should be following my lead.
the debt that vache owes to the underworld rests with me. all i can do is help everyone to the best of my ability... to the very end.
if someone has chosen these victims deliberately... first a smuggler, then a family celebrity... then this murderer's motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.
just as i expected, we're only on the surface of this dream. let's go.
i will find a way to access more medical resources and help you through your struggles. if i must, i'll get help from the surface...
--seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. with you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
*sigh* if it was at all possible, i would've preferred to leave these people alone, but seeing how things are now, i probably should just accept it and push on.
it appears it was in a hurry because of this unconscious fungus.
it's almost like how you helped me -- i really cherish and appreciate it. after all, it wouldn't be right to take such "blessings" for granted in our lives.
(the king does not appear entirely aware of his surroundings. the man by his side, though... we should keep a close eye on him.)
really? are you doing this on purpose?
i understand, but sometimes, everything is dictated by which side you're on.
it must have been kafka! she's got a scary sword.
...once you've tasted freedom, it's difficult to accept a life of separation and isolation. those of us whose childhoods were marred by tragedy... we must strive to do better for the next generation.
um, anyway, now that the organizer and the sponsor have both been arrested, what should we do about the fungi and this tournament?
florent? it is true that he was closest to my father, and thus had the best chance of learning about his dealings with jacques...
alright, now that we're all here, let me help set the scene for everyone...
the stores have changed, and so have the vendors... well, that's to be expected.
it looks like the situation is more serious than i thought.
yes... and now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
now the atmosphere here is like water poured into a container... the water is more secure and settled, but it has lost its free-flowing nature from the river.
hahaha... uh, -- it's mainly just that i, uh... can't always comprehend the... lofty ideals and, uh... principles you discuss...
you made a call in a time of crisis, and you've come all this way to talk to me. even the guards couldn't stop you. that must have taken a lot of courage!
but you can't bring yourself to do that, can you? you care too much about director aurelie and the home she built you all to let go.
they have families, loved ones, friends, and communities. they have dreams that they are still trying to achieve.
as in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
the profoundest of the profound is the musou no hitotachi. a sword art without parallel in all the world. with you as my sparring partner, i can perfect that technique even further.
the exit's over there... how do we get to it?
i once told myself that i would never speak of these events again. facing the fact that she is gone is unbearably painful.
ah... so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
i won't have any chance of making that charge stick though, unless we find more evidence. it'll be up to you to make it back in time and hand the decisive evidence to me.
you could take the view that whatever i say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the ley lines.
the annual express spring cleaning? i love tidying rooms! i'll clean everywhere as best i can!
i took a closer look, and the craftsmanship doesn't appear to resemble anything from this era. if i remember correctly, that style was last in vogue several hundred years ago.
so you can try working together with others as well... as long as you can see them, hehe.
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans...)
constructing a realistic dream consumes a similar energy.
however, the problem is that his dreams have too much structure and continuity. most dreams are far more fragile than you could imagine.
i see. tell me more about him and what he's like...
looks like things are getting heated. i think we'd better get outta here.
are we... both in control of this hanu character?
yes, it was me. are you surprised?
no! i swear i've never done anything like that. what is going on...? let's open it and see what this is all about.
the heavenly principles have been silent for many years, but the gnoses are symbols of their control over teyvat and all the laws...
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
hmm... but doesn't the way she suddenly told you to leave the city suggest that maybe she had some sense of what was about to happen? it almost seems as if she was moving you to safety.
ahem... heh... ahahaha... so it is you, blond traveler from another land! why, i almost thought you were someone from that mob of my ignorant subjects, come to kneel and beg for my forgiveness.
hmm, she's only asleep and hasn't started sleepwalking... it seems she hasn't sunk too deep into her dream yet.
no, i just returned after going out for a while. i did some investigating yesterday regarding the name "vacher."
hmm? was there something else you wanted to talk about?
c--come on! how could i possibly lack confidence! you believe in me, right, masters?
you've already met junkichi and shigeru.
*groan* ...why do i have to write so many papers, whyyy...
i'm sure you've heard about what happened at the opera house? someone got turned into water right in front of us...
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
hehe, looks like you're almost done sorting out your brain.
the matrix of prescience has amazing powers, and can iterate and reiterate kafka's past... so it got me thinking -- if i turned the matrix on me, could it calculate my past?
don't worry about it! that misunderstanding is all in the past now.
imposing, huh... oh, i've got it! let's try this!
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
phew... we're finally done.
the memory recovery seems to have been a success. this dream has served its purpose.
march said something like that at first, too.
at the same time, the blessing of remembrance will fall upon everyone. please look forward to this surprise.
not at all. you don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. all you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
we must be close... i wonder who she is?
hehe, you seem to enjoy taking care of others.
...people with big dreams have big determination.
(it looks like it's very curious about us.)
dendro elemental power of that concentration will cause the rainforest to overgrow...
let's head over. oh, by the way...
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
hmm... i can't seem piece this together in a way that makes sense.
precisely! my dear partners, we've got a huge problem right now that only you can solve!
you wouldn't understand! all cute things in the world should share a mutual affinity!
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten... complicated.
i think you and i both feel the same way about the profound tragedy of melus's loss, and... the sheer depravity of marcel's actions.
you fixated your gaze on the lover that passed away, instead of paying attention to the living people around you.
no. and i think they know that, but they're just too afraid to take that final, terrifying step... they're still hoping there might be an alternative solution.
"unlikely, potential..." meaning there could still be conflicts...
yeah, i'm pretty confident too.
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
okay, but what is this treasure, anyway? we've got all the keys, right? so, can we just go in and take a look?
it's okay... i trust your judgment. i was being a little hasty myself. let's see if we can think of another way.
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
remember, all we need are some wide zoom shots of the streets. if you happen to find some particularly lovely patches of flowers and grass, feel free to grab some close-ups of those as well.
"tomorrow will come." everyone assumes this as common knowledge, but the only way you can know that for sure is if you experience tomorrow.
i knew you would keep your promise, after all... i'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days -- have you managed to get any sleep at all?
well, to use an analogy... let's say a rishboland tiger ate a fox and got diarrhea.
now, i've brought some seawater from poisson. as everyone knows, a massive flood struck the area not long ago, taking many lives...
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory...
good. how about you, little one? i trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
...well, this teddy bear has sure been through the wars. don't worry, i'll help hook repair junjun, but i'll need to find some stuffing...
huh? me again? it hurts, y'know!
*sigh* i know. i just... she's...
wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. everything we do is for the citizens of the underworld. that passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
true heroes in immersia don't merely settle for "satisfying!"
first, based on the information katayoun provided, we can assume that the seelie is a student from the rtawahist darshan.
the connection between us is amazing! it's like flora and the fence it grows upon.
here's hoping the matrix is accurate, and that diviner fu won't decline our request...
it appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
another example... if you're thirsty in the real world, then you might find yourself trudging through a desert in your dream.
remember, your first instinct is very important.
i'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
wait, hold on! let's fight the dragon together!
if his goal is that place as well, there won't be anything left there.
*panting* phew... i'm so tired... i totally thought they had caught me...
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
alrighty then, let's take this little fella with us to the festival! now, i think it's time we came up with a catchy name for them...
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
yeah, i think that's what tighnari was trying to tell me.
you're like a broken record...
are these puppets part of the stage setup? even so, it's so eerie that the entire front hall is empty.
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
actually, no -- forget that. far more trouble than it's worth.
it's not like i have a very eventful life these days. actually, i barely leave the house. so i don't see how it's unusual that my meals are a little simpler now too.
*sigh* snow as far as the eye can see. which direction should we take?
we've met so many people on our journey, there's no way we'll be able to narrow it down...
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
aw, this isn't good... can you try harder? i'm sure you can at least remember your name...
no, no... that's not what i meant...
melus, silver... when did you two get here!?
this story is abstract enough that it still resonates with the present information recorded in irminsul.
but that doesn't mean your own past has disappeared.
there's never been any big problems with the akademiya's governance of sumeru. this is the first time i've seen them step out of line.
who knows if it'll happen this time... i can't put all my eggs in one basket.
nice! the crisis on this world is basically over, right?
we've left debbi's dream, but the dream is still continuing onward. i'm not sure where it'll lead us.
(something's not right... let me think for a little while longer.)
you really understand more about life than i do.
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza...
alright, ask away.
but, i can tell you one thing: my favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
see that robot over there, the one that looks like a jellyfish? that's probably one of the service robots madam herta was talking about, right?
let's split up and ask around about the seelie. hopefully someone knows something more.
but that miss firefly is truly mysterious. there's no information on her in the hotel system. even if she's a stowaway... she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
i'm sorry, but this isn't something i need your help with. leave this one to me.
ah! what about the girl in red? that robot is gonna take her away!
i see. using two people's different perspectives...
she brought her brother underground and entrusted him with her clinic and laboratory...
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
all so that as soon as i appeared on the stage, the trial may commence without a hitch. am i right?
did you see that? there's something on the monster's back.
however, the same applies to the order. their plan didn't materialize overnight, and they have the profound collective consciousness of the planet of festivities behind them...
at this point, i'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
*sigh* huh? what's that huge structure in the distance...
hey, if anything, shouldn't i be more grand and delightful in your dreams!? we've been through so much together and that's how your brain remembers me?
uh, yes. that's right...
uh-huh! i... let's just leave it here for a while... and it'll be alright, right?
...hey, get outta there or you'll shiver to death.
is this all the water we're getting?
i have already traveled through this world once. once you reach the end of your journey as i did, you will see for yourself the true nature of this world.
then i should do my best to honor it.
perhaps she's around here somewhere? shouldn't we take a look?
hey, you're gonna take it!? yinshu, this isn't your fault -- you don't have to do this.
yes, but it may take some time for him to wake up after his consciousness returns to his body.
huh, i never knew... but from my perspective, romeuf's position had a lot going for it. couldn't they have sat down and talked it out?
hehe, that settles it, then. now, there are already a few visitors at the shrine. make sure you take good care of them.
my pom-pom toy... not a bad idea! that's kinda like bringing the conductor on vacay with me. ah, but i think it's too big to stuff in the case...
ah, but no, now's not the time for that.
however, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
but we don't really have any choice. this is all we've got.
do you think he captured someone and put them in the coffin?
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
you say that like i'm six years old or something!
exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. fortunately, i've already managed to identify the author -- he's a failed light novelist named tomoyuki.
w--wait, hold on a second -- are you really saying that miss tingyun was a member of the antimatter legion all along?
i haven't seen oleg. the miners said they saw him take a group further in.
well, don't mind me. find a place to sit down and buckle up.
and then, a new page will be turned.
in the blink of an eye, you knocked that big fella into mister yang's black hole and saved me... i still haven't thanked you properly yet...
some people only see the mushroom on the shroomboar's back, and they conclude that a shroomboar is a mushroom.
nice, sounds like we've got a few fans out there too!
wake up... gotta wake up!
you nearly died because of what other people did... and many died because of you. as a non-human being, you hated gods and humans alike.
that's because i already took care of most of them over the past couple of days. of the remaining few, we trapped some of them inside the castle and chased the rest back out of the city.
the more we know now, the better we can plan for and react to any future situation.
theoretically, we should have gone straight into debbi's dream. things do seem to have gone a bit sideways here...
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
to be honest, i haven't slept a wink for days... just thinking about the awful state of my thesis keeps me up at night.
...do you have the letters on you, mister oswell? let me take a look.
the akademiya has probably kept your body, so you should be able to wake up soon.
finally, if you still think you can copy the fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment...
yes, otherwise i wouldn't be here.
we shouldn't give up hope just yet. let's try to find another way to attack this problem.
i'm sorry, i didn't intend to hide this... i have to fulfill sam's mission according to the script. that aside... there are my personal motives: i wish to get to know this world as firefly.
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
wait. hold on a sec. this is the first time i'm hearing about this "certain person"... who are you chasing, and why would that lead you to the express?
um... my answer is going to be even more of a disappointment.
that wubbaboo looked so upset. what happened to it...
yup! i always say what i'm thinking.
hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.
thus he became known as the father of penacony.
well, give it some thought. i'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
i had always thought i could make my wishes come true. but now that i think about it, that never solely relied on me. many things can only be accomplished with someone else's help.
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
thus did i give up all of my divine power to provide everyone with energy for their daily lives. have you ever seen a more magnanimous god?
had i made all enemies of eternity stand against you, you still would not have wavered.
yes, this is another case of possession -- only this time, whoever possessed him actively sought him out.
mhm, thank you for that, florent. and colter, thank you for telling me about this as well.
thus, the gnosis became not only useless, but also a potential source of conflict.
i guess you could say that's one of my virtues.
to prevent more tragedies like this, we must end the samsara as soon as possible.
ah, i see. so in other words, i need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
as for the context... we'll need to sort that out a bit. hurry along now. recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
yes, i want to try something. there must still be a small wisp of possibility...
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
but... we still don't have any weapons in hand...
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
but you can trust her, even with your life. stick around a bit longer and you'll see what i mean.
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying...
let's go and make an inquiry. we can also ask around the house of daena and see if anyone else knows something about the wisdom seelie.
hah! i had a feeling you'd say that!
seems like my subconscious mind has no talent for screenwriting.
once we're there, we can stay a few days before we return.
a simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. it even allows me to verify my own existence.
huh? is his past really that dark?
i also got to sit on a gigantic flower carriage. farris, the knight of flowers, raised me really, really high above the ground, and i was throwing an endless amount of yalda candies at the children...
alright, please come with me.
hehe, good. saves me from having to explain everything again.
i knew it'd be harder than i had expected.
florent, let's grab some reference shots!
don't worry, i will definitely find the truth.
rushed into it without thinking... hehe, well put. ah, she acts like such a child sometimes.
navia, the president of the spina di rosula...
i'm guessing... you two came to talk about them, right?
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
since you are also driven by emotions, maybe you can understand my thoughts right now.
have you seen this lady?
haha, it's possible.
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
...this place doesn't seem to have changed much from what i remember.
yeah, while i'm smart, learning swordplay sounds like a whole lot of work.
hey, even i can say things that sound profound and mysterious!
i really think i've found a true genius for a partner... you're completely right, how did i not connect the dots earlier...
back when i decided to isolate myself in the plane of euthymia, there was no yae publishing house, and certainly no stories of this kind.
no one can remain undefeated for an eternity...
some words are not to be passed on.
hey, look at that! looks like i guessed right.
it's not your first time. i don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
i mustn't keep repeating my past regrets. that's the most valuable lesson i've learned today.
well, the goddess's statue is indeed at the top of the castle. i can take you up there.
speaking of... traveler, what do you think of the resistance army's chances?
hey, no need to mention the official name!
i'm sorry, you two. i didn't mean to bring up any sad memories...
hehe, please just disregard my presence. now, tell us what you discussed.
now that i think of it... on the day my father was convicted of murder, it was also raining.
she may have been a mighty hero in the eyes of her troupe, but... at the end of the day, she was only human.
hehe... i wish you both a fun-filled time on narukami island.
uh, ahem, i mean... what can he do exactly? are we gonna set him loose on kafka?
i suppose i should get some sleep. hmm, i must say, i do find it hard to doze off peacefully without the soothing sound of thunder booming in the background.
eh... huh? hahaha, really now? i didn't even notice.
come on, how could i possibly lose?
yes! how could i have forgotten!?
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe... this is just too surreal.
ahh, it really is robin! to run into her in person here...
which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
bah, no way! everything good has come our way due to our hard work. i'm not letting them take any of the credit.
...is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
it said that "nur" is its most important family member.
whenever i see the grand theater, i just can't stop all these thoughts from flooding my head...
so you just happened to be going the same way... did you see what the outworlder was doing?
hey! nobody agreed to that!
they were different from most... but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
can you see the express in boulder town? why does it fly in the sky? who is the conductor?
...so how long does "copycatitis" last?
release my stress... oh, i see what you mean. being at the top of a mountain really does make someone want to yell out loud.
i've been studying the culinary arts since i was a child. i hope my delicious food can help boost people's spirits.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go...
it's a little bit like... porridge? but the resemblance is only superficial...
it seems the gods have really smiled upon you, xavier... and that certainly doesn't include me, mind you.
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
why didn't you... give me the power to stop him from throwing his life away, why did you just let him die, despised and hated by all...
i've tried all kinds of ways, too, to hold back the sea. anything to keep the coastline from advancing...
but even knowing all of that, one question remains: how did you do it?
*sigh* oh papa, what madness drove you to ask the person who killed you to take care of me...
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
mmm... it's really good.
it sure is... but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
even if life is short, memories can be eternal. as long as black swan still remembers me, the mark i leave on this world will not disappear.
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
because its external form doesn't matter, right?
not exactly. i already had a vision by that time.
that... is something i agree on.
ahahaha... i'm not quite a hero yet.
hey, i'm hardly reckless with my mora. i'll have you know, all the purchases i made today were well within my budget.
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
i'm not all that different from you, you know. all right, let's go. we can talk on the way.
she had their utmost trust, admiration, and love... and she truly deserved it.
yes, how could you forget?
thank you for doing this for me... no, for us.
she's only steps away from the finish line... she's already made a lot of progress, so there's no need to push too hard now.
whew... amazing, so this is how it feels to walk out of that cage with my own body.
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate... ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
we were just about to discuss the boards over here. they're related to our little helpers' tasks, so i'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
fine. a promise is a promise. since i promised to study hard, i'll do my best starting today!
i am rather curious about you, though. why are you trying to help her?
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future...
positions, everyone! we'll move on to the next scene after we try a few more kamera angles.
if applied to the outside... you would still be able to smell "auguste," even in the daytime...
this guy doesn't seem like the negotiable type. what should we do?
kachina! mualani!
(it's becaaaause... because, because, because...)
...but then wait, where does bullying the owner of the sleepless earl fit in with all of this?
oh, and i must remind you that after the disaster at poisson, nobody wants to see any more people dissolve.
whew... you scared me for a moment there. i nearly thought we had lost everything...
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. time for anti-raiden shogun training phase two.
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
hmm... you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet...
seeing it still standing there, tall and proud... it makes me really happy.
i hope these tests won't take too long...
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
although of course, with the continued growth of the spina, papa wanted poisson to eventually grow into a metropolis not unlike the court.
junjun... so she gave her bear a name, huh?
i can personally testify that this one works. when i'm sleepy, i'll do anything as long as i can finally get some sleep!
aww, what are you talking about? the fun's just about to begin.
ahaha! yes, but don't get too excited now... my dear believers and spectators alike tend to get quite rowdy, and despite the noise, i've come to tolerate all their ruckus.
first on the list is the experiment to get observational data. i actually had it all planned out several days ago and even borrowed a celestial globe from a mahamata.
if there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. i'm always happy to listen to other people's problems... who knows, i might even try to help you come up with a solution.
i'm sorry, here i am talking your ear off again. this is a day to remember. we should welcome it with smiles.
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
because sachin's research is not mistaken. he spent his entire life researching this topic, and these materials are a result of that.
it won't require much elemental power. i'm just worried that it'll become unstable.
y'know, the more i look at this statue, the less "dan-hengy" it gets...
are you ready? i have high standards, you know.
haha, you don't need a jade abacus to get a feel for sampo...
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
i know, right? why did they have to base this dream on my birthday? could it really just be a coincidence?
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
seeing as you're right here in front of me like this, then i guess... the answer is "a trashcan," right?
a new sense of adventure often begins with the little things in life.
i'm so jealous that you got a good night's sleep. i was traumatized and too scared to even close my eyes. i thought if i fell asleep, i'd never wake up again.
okay, off i go. bye!
and that's why i wanted to call the kind person who's always helping me as the "blessing from the stars."
well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
actually, i didn't need any answers -- he made them all up himself.
but i do not believe my father was a murderer. i'm sure he was set up...
therefore, many people will strive forward to forge new paths, even if they have to endure great pain to do so.
i'm sorry, everyone. i could have done better in the third round...
does this place ring any bells, misha?
hehe, you're welcome. i'm glad i could help.
i know there are many grievances between you on both sides, but it is essential that you remain calm after entry. this is as much for your own safety as anything else.
there seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. to put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands...
don't let small things get in the way of your friendship.
that said, i hear that yae publishing house's novels are all reviewed by miko herself.
i went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
hahaha, kinda like in real life.
what about that knife i hid in my boot?
long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
here's the situation: the clinic is packed full of people injured in the mines incident. since you helped us resolve things, seele and i have been busy caring for them.
i see, so you've combined all your favorite sights from your travels into one.
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
well then, i guess we're lucky we've got a local like me to organize things. wonderful -- the spotlight, at last! i guess i'll be facilitating things from here.
but what inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like makoto.
that's right. you should have gotten the gist of the content in my thesis when i was explaining it earlier. so, ask away.
to be accurate, i'm using the akasha as a medium to occupy katheryne's consciousness.
wanderer, this is the shakkei pavilion. in your balladeer incarnation, this is where the electro archon placed you after your creation. you had a great many memories here.
during this time, i did some self-reflection. my sense of inferiority and yielding to the akademiya led to all of this, and created so much trouble for you all.
hook, what's wrong? has someone been bullying you?
it's okay, i'm not here to see him. we just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
i came up with my name myself, but some people just call me march... which do you prefer?
hey, isn't that a wubbaboo?
ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy... i sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
dear audience, the performance is experiencing a technical difficulty, but worry not! the guards shall resolve it soon enough!
besides the macaroni, i should also pick up some tomato sauce...
leave the formalities for later. you should find domenico first.
please prosecute them in accordance to the law. spina di rosula will not raise any objections.
i've already tried that, but all the key members of the akademiya -- even the corps of thirty guards -- intentionally avoid wearing their akasha terminals.
g-given the situation, this is our best hope... let's just get it over with quickly!
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
i think this moment heralds the third time.
no one will disturb us now. here, how about i show you a little magic trick?
you see, layla doesn't have many friends at the akademiya. if the others noticed her helping them out, i thought maybe i'd help her become more sociable.
...don't look at me like that. i... i'm not used to being stared at.
you don't know? but surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
does it have something to do with your dream? please, tell us what you mean.
understood. keep monitoring. keep me informed should anything come up at the institute.
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
so you see, it's not just me! i guess everyone shouts from the top of a mountain at some point in their life.
mom said they still live at the old house, but they're not working on the front lines anymore. they should still have some connections in the medical school and the hospital, though.
yes, and you are the hero.
modeling a few poses, of course! here, just pretend to be callas, and i'll be clementine.
so you're someone who barely smiles and doesn't like sweets... huh, you're really starting to remind me of this one friend of mine...
take your time, pick some good ones. i'll be right here.
okay. next, i will show you a secret kitsune spell. this painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means i'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
no, i immediately understood what's happening with that plant... i'm just not sure if i should say it.
besides jacques, the attack from the gardemeks has been bothering me quite a bit as well.
allow me to explain.
i--i'm okay! let's do it! only way to find out is to give it a go!
hehe. that's good.
and you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. hehehe...
no need to be so formal, i'm just a regular person like everyone else now. oh! is this fontinalia mousse? it's one of my favorites!
"take a photo"...? once again, i'm faced with a combination of words that makes absolutely no sense to me.
allow me to introduce furuyama. he is a tea master and a member of my retinue.
speaking of which, did anything strange happen when you drank the primordial seawater?
it's fine, she wouldn't mind. really, she wouldn't.
the duties i perform will not change.
i'm not doing this just to protect you, but also because i hope to use you and your experience and try speaking to apep again.
may your travels go smoothly, may the spina continue to grow, and may our friendship last until the end of time!
hehe, don't underestimate my experience. after watching a countless number of musicals, i've learned one important thing.
besides, you'll be at the meeting! if any problems do pop up, you'll have no problem navigating them.
but the fireworks...
welcome, welcome! when we face the monsters, i'll make sure to charge in front to give everyone some cover. you can take care of the healing at the back!
a chance combination. hmm, interesting. may i try this drink?
huh? wait, you mean the suspense thriller novel that was a number-one bestseller?
i see... well. i won't lie -- i'm a little shocked to hear that from you, but i suppose you are just travelers who have only arrived in fontaine, after all...
*sigh* fine, looks like i can't keep the act up any longer. i even tried to look a little panicky to emulate her behavior.
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
too many faces, too small a budget. maybe next time.
i've never heard the name "arataki" before... but they must be one of my subjects, and so i thought, why not grant them their wish?
that's some strong wind!
wow... this is astonishing. is it some kind of magic? it seems to be... another copy of me?
but once everything is over, i'll be sure to pay a visit to her mind and explain everything. anyway, let's keep going.
excellent. ah, i'm looking forward to the next round... i'll await your good news~
i guess not! eagle sounds about right.
so far, so good. a classic tale. what happened after that?
ah... her? how is this possible?
hehe, i know. i just wanted to see how they'd react.
awesome. in that case, meet me back here once you've found them all.
dehya sold her greatsword to raise additional funds, and she was injured because she wasn't used to her new weapon.
but i was too young to know what long-term frustration could do to a person. it changed him in a terrible way...
imagine launching a surprise attack when your enemy is fast asleep. the cheek!
no, i have nothing to share with you at this time. but you... you use elemental energy without the aid of a vision. how is this possible? please enlighten me.
one is the desire for a gnosis, since he was created to be the vessel for one.
no, only a handful. after all, i prefer warm memories baked in sunshine. they're the ones that usually belong to kind people.
we've certainly taken a big step forward, but i feel that's about it. we know that there is an organization that means to dissolve these young women, but we still don't know what they are really after.
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
maybe you think you're being the realist by painting the history of the spina and poisson like this.
yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
sure, as long as it doesn't spoil anything in the script! you've brought up bits and pieces of the hunters' history before, but it was all in passing.
anyway, if you're trying to bully this young lady, you'd better watch out for the weapon in my hand!
let's do this! great mine, here we come!
wait, wait, wait -- you're not even a little bit surprised by this?
in terms of the outcome alone... that's true.
(how strange... this uneasy feeling seems so real. how did they manage that?)
well... of course. how else could i be reading this message...? seriously.
please stop, master yanqing and master yunli! i lost the duel, and now i have to accept the result. as a nameless, i don't want to be known as a sore loser.
aw, you really care about the little one quite a lot, don't you? hm, i'm a little jealous. i wish my friends were caring like that.
my second question has to do with the ensuing duel. if the truth is indeed as you described...
i'm not that confident... but thank you for believing in me.
besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
who knows? i don't remember anything before that.
well, ah... then i'll still bring everyone, albeit with only one dish per table.
memory is like the deep blue sea. but if you try to catch two fish with one cast... you might not be satisfied with your catch.
when there's time, i'll have to tell you all about what happened on that trip. there are quite a few interesting bits.
ode to fool... this must be the second act.
so if you hypothetically wanted to do something against me, all you would need to do is get rid of the meka's serial numbers and send them after me...
so why... why am i crying?
no, wait. to be more accurate, it's urakusai's memory.
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
i know you must have a lot to say...
huh, what's all the commotion about?
hey! is it trying to pull a charged attack?
if you must, seele. try not to worry... i don't want to see you two fighting.
so, you're the key in the end, i assume?
no saving allowed! let's keep it relevant: this time's for now, next time's for later. no ious on praise!
ha, my observational skills are second to none.
i will admit that i've been running away for a long time.
so the heart of oasis is apep's source of power...
the masked fools... so this really was their doing.
and you didn't hear anything else at all? nothing that might leave an impression of any kind?
"a small something for the lost..."
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
a soldier's perspective is always valuable, dunn.
you're talking weird again... but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
use the meteor shower as a pretext to take yoimiya all around sumeru. then, when you're ready, blow this.
others see only the shroomboar's body, and they declare that a shroomboar is a boar.
i'm sure he didn't get lost. even i was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
um... i didn't understand a word of what you just said.
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch...
the balladeer is no. six of the fatui harbingers. in terms of strength, he is superior to signora.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
that's right, i'm the sword champion...
they want to blow up the clementine line!?
...seems like we're all out of flour and sugar. the two most important ingredients of all.
the book contains many ancient "kaidan" -- or tales of the supernatural -- and is written in a very engaging way. that is why the book has become so popular.
i'm glad we're on the same page. we can't just let this kid do whatever she wants.
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
in the past, i used to have many believers coming to see me at the shrine every day, and most of them came for the same reason.
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are... learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
hmm... they're actually getting clearer for me. i was sorta expecting this, even before i read the message.
we'll have to cut the banter short... let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
and when they asked, of course i couldn't refuse. i mean, come on, a brand new script! nobody has ever played it before!
even if i was gonna release it back into the sky, it'd have to be strong enough to fly first. if i left it where i found it... i fear it'd never get the chance to fly ever again.
i won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
i'm guessing the patients you met weren't exactly singing my praises, which is why you tracked the dealer down and made inquiries first.
i will spend more of what the spina earns on the betterment of poisson. what's more, i'd also like to propose some changes to the aquabus routes...
okay, you won. go on, you can put on that smug face now.
i didn't have high hopes, but amazingly, sampo brought me my mother's reply.
um... just between the two of us, could you tell me what it was like to be the geovishap's pet?
that'd be much appreciated, thank you. actually, i have another question -- do you have the authority to dispatch gardemeks?
items purchased in the dreamscape can also be brought into reality through an extra service. unfortunately, the transfer of automobiles to the real world is not available at the moment... you can come back for them next time.
hehe, that's part of the fun! the uncertainty of fate is what gives these games their appeal.
it seems like i need to find a place to insert the rune...
the xianzhou alliance... i've heard of them, but never had any contact with them.
*deep breaths* alright, layla, you got this! you were able to explain everything earlier, so you can do it again...
um... i guess it's because the animation has a retro style.
yeah... looking back on it now as an adult, i can hardly believe how patient and kind everyone was.
it feels like my entire body is bubbling with excitement after yelling like that.
not at all, and i've asked pretty much everyone in the court of fontaine already.
sure enough, no one knows about miss robin. i'm not surprised.
the trust that these four fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the wisdom orb.
ugh, you need to log out once in a while.
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
if we hadn't dealt with it in time, things could have gone very badly.
i overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
don't pretend you didn't hear that, hook, i'm talking to you!
i'm gonna... get back on my feet, and keep moving forward.
i... i understand. it's only right to return the favors i receive!
oh, paimon, you're just as carefree and enthusiastic as ever. well, it's about time for me to get into character. as a contestant, i need to go and get ready for the tournament...
it's not so bad... at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
if you claim to know so much more than i, then why don't you truly think about why you want to survive... and why you're so vengeful!
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
wait, there's something wrong with this bridge! run for it!
but as long as you can be healthy again, then nothing else matters to me, apep.
are you kidding me? i think you've proven yourselves more than capable of that.
even if you keep reliving those beautiful memories, it'll only highlight the emptiness in your real life.
we don't have many more festivals to waste. hurry and find the truth.
i know your past. the things you want to see, to touch, to know...
even though the protagonist refuses to acknowledge his innate talents, he has a rare dedication to justice.
suit yourself. worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is ei, so what's the big deal?
are you suggesting that the ipc has a remedy?
*sigh* i'd love to sit down and chat with all of you, but i still have a backlog of patients to see.
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it... they don't teach this stuff in school. wait... did i even go to school?
i hope that your studies in vahumana will help you deal with your own fate, and learn how best to settle old debts from your past.
hmm, this does pose a bit of a problem. if we can't find your brother, well, we can't perform an exorcism with nothing to exorcise, can we?
you mentioned that there were other survivors besides yourself. where are they? maybe they'll remember.
the second step is to focus all your anxiety on that point.
what they say is true: you have to see the world for yourself to appreciate how beautiful it is.
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
yeah! can you give us an overview?
i mean, considering how you helped us out with cocolia, i'm sure bronya would be happy to see you!
what's wrong with that? we've got ten fingers, may as well use them!
were it not for that... perhaps i'd still be no match for the twilight sword. even after five hundred years.
i learned then that there's always a cost to making a mistake. the more you care about those around you, the more you should care about doing the right thing to the best of your abilities.
it spews out poison, and transmutes everything it touches... no wonder they call it the "evil dragon."
the moment i entered the dream, i felt like i was wrapped in a blanket of warm feelings.
"ahh, i can't go back anymore," and other similar thoughts started to come to mind... i guess i'm still not used to being in the akademiya yet.
(everyone has a history, paimon. even if you're a puppet created by the electro archon.)
have i been... doing the right thing?
ugh, come on, stop fooling around.
hmm, i thought we would arrive at some familiar scene, but we seem to have landed in a completely unfamiliar place.
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
this plant is not known to the academic world. it's a new species that her teacher managed to cultivate by some special means.
aha, so that's how it's done.
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
why, this is the most exciting sub-plot of the novel: the secret investigation. i'm sure you must be curious about where the magical powers of the wisdom orb and floral jelly really come from?
forty-seven... forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty!
these puppets... where are they guiding us this time?
no one gets left out of my stories!
hey, it talks! and it knows that we aren't from this planet?
i am sorry. it is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face... i think it might be my favorite.
i'm alright... so i wrote to the amurta students, and they were really keen. i got a reply with the information i needed within just a few hours.
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate...
i don't need any compensation. all i'd ask in return, if you're willing, is that you tell me some more about the life and work of your late director.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
(the day's finally over. i haven't had a moment to breathe this whole time...)
ah, you don't refuse. may i assume you accept then?
i'm under a lot of pressure, and it really stresses me out... i don't know if i'm studying hard enough, or how my future will turn out...
this way, i can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
for centuries, manifestations of my authority have served the nation of fontaine.
i vote monsters. that's the main duty of the hunters, right? we can come back to the sorcerer later.
she also appears to be standing right behind you.
...at least he won't be getting in our way again. let's go find that gallagher and ask him the intricacies of the case.
master yunli has a very freestyle approach to teaching. the thing she always says to me is: "you just feel it!" maybe that's what they call experiential guidance?
look over there! i think i can see the next unit.
hmm, what sauce should i pick for my macaroni tonight?
oh wow -- she's cool!
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
i can't let myself see only the things i want to see. how would that make me any different from before?
*pant*... *pant*... ahh...
oh. so what? you did offer to treat me to a meal, didn't you? anyway, i am something of a vip, you know. wouldn't you find it embarrassing to treat me anything short of lavishly?
...don't you have anything nice to say!?
i respect your decision, and with time, i will prove to you that we will not repeat our mistakes.
going for the big reveal right at the beginning would have been an anti-climax of the most literal kind. i wanted to see how you'd react in a situation like this, and you did not disappoint...
it's alright, clara, no pressure. just tell us how you feel about it.
um... thank you? that's not answering my question though...
i can be a little bit camera-shy -- just don't laugh at me. here, you hold the camera.
traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
i... have nothing to say to that.
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
(we came to inazuma because we tracked the thief here...)
and i'm forced to lock my consciousness in this boundless darkness.
i gave him that advice because i once saw a worker doing the same thing. whenever he became tired, he would look at some names on the handle of his tool.
i've never heard of anything like that, but... if you want to give it a try, i'll do my best to protect your consciousness during the process.
anyway, what's most important is that we've wrapped the film. i'm pretty confident that we'll take first prize!
such tight security... i bet they're stumped by the case as well.
uncovering hidden treasure is the most exciting part of adventuring! what do we have here... huh?
you'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
(...you didn't even take cooking as one of your skill proficiencies!)
thoughts from the experts? are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
wait... it's not an enemy! it's my shroom buddy!
ah... that line actually makes me a bit nervous...
...hey, slow down! we still have questions that need answering!
nothing turns a frown upside down like good food! how about some macarons? i could make you some!
in other words, it's probably just conducting research, and the nature of its research is very similar to mine.
everything alright? you feeling okay?
...hm, a brilliant deduction.
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
it can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then... allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps...
oh, okay... meet you back here later then. hope you have a good time!
please help us tell the others not to do anything reckless.
yeah, way back when i first became the president of the spina di rosula, she was all over me, wouldn't take no for an answer...
i only heard her voice. i wouldn't say i saw her...
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
hehe, you mustn't judge a book by its cover, you know.
uh... an emergency response plan...?
now that fontaine's biggest star has returned to the stage, i figured it's about time the industry enjoyed a breath of fresh air!
exactly. this is very interesting, i've never seen anything like it.
please, you're always encouraging me. i'm starting to feel embarrassed.
then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began five hundred years ago.
what? but we've done a whole day's work -- what's the sun playing at? it felt like we spent the whole day in the palace of astrum.
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
are you doing this on purpose!?
maybe we could go on another trip together sometime?
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned... that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
stripped of ambitions, stripped of the potential for change, it does nothing more than simply... exist. it is a hollow shell of a nation.
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means...
you sure didn't hesitate much. is the relationship between all the versions of you really that bad?
consider this -- no one will lose their life on account of having their vision taken away...
(finally, mister yang approves detective march's theory!)
yeah, i'm ready... but please go easy on me!
i'm sure the others will also be here in no time. hmm... xavier, if we end up getting called on stage, shouldn't you come up with a name for our crew?
huh? geez, can you be a little more humble?
i don't know. it's just something that suddenly occurred to me.
oh! and i'm sure neuvillette and those people from the marechaussee phantom are freaking out right next to them, too. hehehe...
...dan heng, wanna... talk about mister yang's findings?
oh, i was trying to say there's no need for you to apologize.
one of the most classic challenges is to use three stars with shifting orbits to predict the overall changes that may have occurred.
anything special about that name?
well, everyone, make sure that you've got all your belongings with you before we leave.
to be human is to live with imperfections. you can choose whether or not you want to be human.
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
is there any other way to enter a dream besides the hotel room's dreampool?
toodle-oo to you too. i'm going home to take a rest now.
...you're right, not the best moment for distant memories, i don't want to waste your time.
yes, well, sumeru is the land of the god of wisdom, where the quest for wisdom and knowledge is never-ending.
hah, you're absolutely right. perhaps they occasionally best the shogun's army in open battle, but when they face the raiden shogun herself...
there must be another lamp hiding around here somewhere...
i wish it were made up... unfortunately it's all true.
there's a rich scent of curiosity here... such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
i'm... sorry to hear that. i wish there was something i could do...
so as we follow the story, it leads us to specific scenes? sounds pretty innovative. what does the message in the envelope say?
(is this something that i didn't prepare for at all!? you've gotta be joking!)
(i think she actually really enjoys it...)
oh, she had a bunch of codenames. i heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked...
that "first" dunyarzad is in front of you right now, and... she doesn't have a lot of time left.
tell me the truth sampo -- what are you gonna do about the overworld girl?
...still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
i really don't want to experience that feeling of despair again.
i'm afraid not -- at least, not at this very moment.
if you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. there are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
really? that's so nice... it feels just like a tea party with friends.
really? that's kinda strange. in theory, i should've already awakened all your memories.
in her eyes, the most precious things in this world were dreams -- the yearning for a better future held by living beings.
if i don't end up staying at the akademiya after graduation, i think i'll come travel the world with you. what do you think?
i'm writing a letter to the astral express. it's been a while, and i thought i should let them know that i'm safe and sound here.
you're right, i can't save everyone alone... but if i must, i would sacrifice food and sleep to treat them.
no way. please put more trust in me.
uh-huh, a petite cutie with pink hair. madam herta appointed her to be the acting lead researcher.
well, this chance won't come often, and we do have a tea set. perhaps i should try my hand at making us a pot of tea.
is this lady... your friend too?
this memory zone... is overly twisted. i have to use inelegant methods, so you two... please give me a little time...
hey, i'm improving! i'm coming up with a plan right now... aaaand... got one!
this man is katsuragi, deputy to torachiyo's adopted son, mikoshi nagamasa. he found the balladeer in shakkei pavilion and took him back to tatarasuna.
a gray fox stood up and addressed the monster. it said: "you are the cleverest among us. surely you can help us find a way to solve this."
only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. only if you are strong enough can i deliver you to the right destination.
my question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
it's all just a well-devised scam.
still, you two should get the story straight before you join up with your friend. if not, she's gonna see right through everything.
it's okay. let them through.
those stellaron hunters... they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
we moved from that building to this building in the blink of an eye... this would be impossible in reality.
belobog, here we come!
alright, then let's give it a go tomorrow afternoon.
sounds good to me! i support your decision.
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
sure, no worries. i'll be right here, so just come find me once you've retrieved them. i'm counting on you!
yep. possess them through the akasha, imply that they've already converted to the faith of king deshret, and then convey our made-up "will of king deshret."
ah, i must say, i would relish the opportunity to watch the fatui getting a taste of their own medicine...
why? why is every elevator in the underworld busted!?
not only have you stopped paying attention to the world, but you have stopped paying attention to yourself.
but you said she could remember what you had told her before, right?
abolishing the sakoku decree has a myriad of implications. it would be folly to say that it will be all positive, and there will be no negative repercussions.
i fight for the everlasting future of inazuma. however long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
don't worry about it. like they told me after announcing my name during the curtain call -- everyone's work deserves recognition.
i'm just happy i didn't get in your way during the fight...
hold him accountable? come on, didn't the luofu fall victim to the disciples of sanctus medicus and the antimatter legion? why would they blame the victim?
if the other side is willing to talk, i'm happy to open the door for a reconciliation. opportunities for new beginnings are all around us.
i still occasionally practice suturing on my old teddy bear, just like in the old days.
if time was allowed to pass within the false memories, there's a higher chance they might conflict with someone's original recollection. that would make it much harder to avoid suspicion.
but a will that cannot be eroded has no way to embrace the future.
a world that many across the universe don't even know exists...
sumeru was apep's territory. in those days, the lush rainforest covered the entire nation.
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
hehe... i understand now: to be a better archon, i first need to better myself.
my form is a symbol of supreme majesty, in which has been vested power over all the realm. it is the cohesive embodiment of all that constitutes the "raiden shogun."
hmm? whatever. let me ask you this, have you heard of any interesting new rumors lately? if so, i'd love to hear about them.
gah, time's ticking! just listen to the grown-ups!
you will miss much by refusing progress... you seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
you're right. i've been doing research for so long that i'm used to having a certain routine...
alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. there is no need to state your name. just be off with you -- do not distract me from my performance.
give me their names! since they're all too eager to tear up other people's clothes, i think it's about time the spina di rosula returned the favor!
very good. it's essential for the kamera operator to understand the director's vision. i'll make my decision after seeing your work.
compared to what you've done for me, this is nothing.
such a direct act of provocation is enough to get my competitive side worked up too.
to solve the mystery of the watchmaker, it is crucial to get the ipc's intel. the path ahead is fraught with danger... but what's trailblazing without a little danger?
it's all about the bartender's pride. it wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. that's the mindset i use when i brew my coffee.
to make this tea party even more lively, i've invited someone else to join us today...
what you were looking for is complete annihilation... but this is just a fantasy. even if the balladeer is removed from existence, the world will not heed your will.
well, what do you say? aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
*sigh* but there's nothing else we can do. it's the one holding all the cards... it's completely hidden and can choose whether to help us or not.
i want to find out the real answer for everyone's sake. for the missing girls... for the victims... and for myself.
...we don't need another amnesiac on this train...
o--oh, so there's still hope after all? goodness, you frightened me -- you spoke so much, and with so much certainty...
...it doesn't matter. everyone has their own preferences.
i can feel your obvious excitement... that means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
yes. plus, we already know that they're strapped for cash. if their financial situation is that dire, they don't have what it takes to challenge us, so this may be the best time to talk.
you can see us as... kindhearted interstellar public servants, lending a helping hand to any world affected by a stellaron!
wait. i thought hallucinations were supposed to be completely random? why did i see an identical me?
but that's impossible. it's always avoiding me and keeping me in the dark... and that won't change, even if you're around.
let's find a place to sort out our findings once melus returns. it seems to me that there are several things that don't add up here.
a world fettered by three paths, its destiny hanging in the balance...
just find somewhere to hide, mister wheel. we'll take care of them!
huh? you can tell?
the first step is to grab a hold of the root cause of your anxiety.
there are things... i'm hiding from you...
leaving already? ah, and i was looking forward to playing a few more rounds with you.
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
for example... this one here! "summon"! doesn't it sound super mysterious and cool?
but in the end, she couldn't give up the radiance of daytime. to cope with her shame, the star buried her guilt and closed her eyes...
well, i say we let you join!
the original mikawa flower festival was much more lively. but even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
huh. i wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
looks like nothing can be found here.
we've reached the shore. let's go -- i'll show you the new poisson.
i felt very sheepish, having had a change of heart after flatly refusing you. and then, to make matters worse, you caught me...
looks like it didn't work...
you mentioned earlier that the troupe was like your "home"...
ah, no, i mean, i nearly gave in to the sheer enthusiasm they displayed... hahaha...
hmm... so should we also take those skills, then?
come on, i don't need that kind of attention. xavier can accept the reward on our behalf.
not at all! you're going to lose -- i mean -- spend all of them in no time once you start playing! just try it and you'll see!
you could capitalize on the rave reviews and license out "the little oceanid" to the bigger theater troupes out there. that would do wonders for your financial situation.
(is this where you introduce your character to everyone? it sounds like they've done this dozens of times.)
it's easy for luka to get ahead of himself sometimes... but i've never seen him this headstrong. it does make me wonder...
cat got your tongue? it's fine, he seems like a good guy. hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
that won't be necessary. i remember it all.
#the chief justice out on investigation, accompanied by {nickname} from afar... no matter how you conceal your whereabouts, there will be countless eyes watching you.
(it seems to be welcoming us as guests.)
listen, we're real beings living in the real world, and that's where our focus should be.
yep. it belongs to akim. his father helped setaria a lot when she first moved to sumeru city, so she still comes by whenever she has time.
the beep is a prompt tone for akasha operations. we still hear it every night, even though we removed our akasha terminals.
i've never liked hearing people put it that way. it's like trying to relieve pain by saying some noble-sounding words. but right now, there's nothing more suitable... they really did become heroes.
it has already noticed our presence.
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up...
this time, the gloves are off!
...did you travel here alone?
my adoptive mother always saw me as her own flesh and blood, and vache loved me like a sister... that is, while we were still young.
uh, um, about th--that...
why do i wield my sword...? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
you drifted from place to place, never able to settle, even where you found status and identity. you adamantly believed that you were missing a heart.
i see. humans have a term for this, it's called "growth."
this is the last part. let's go.
true... if someone from the alchemy commission was suggesting it could be done, then there's always a possibility.
(d--do i really have what it takes to represent the rtawahist darshan?)
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
i see gertie! but who's that lying on the ground?
let me first be clear that i'm not taking guests at this time. so if you're just here to clown around, then please be on your way! shoo!
but that's what everyone said before we went to penacony! "you'll be totally safe under the family's protection!"
(a pawnshop that grants wishes... is there really a place like that on this ship?)
i know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
kept listening to my people and their hearts...
no, no, no... gepard is a captain of the silvermane guards, just like how the luofu has its own cloud knights captains. i have no idea what he's doing running security at a hotel like this though.
for the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices... it is the right choice.
but if we try to fight the guards right now...
i just wanna forget about the thesis altogether! ...heh, i'm just kidding. knowing me, i'd only be able to forget about it for a little while.
and we've already defeated florian, right? so, he won't try to take it from us anymore.
don't you realize how special you are? remember, the plane of euthymia is a space where only she is allowed to exist. the fact that you could appear there tells us one crucial thing:
oh, thank you. ah, the sound of being called "director" and the aroma of coffee... feels almost as refreshing as hearing the birds chirping in the morning.
each year for their anniversary, my dad would send my mom a bouquet of ball peonies wrapped in red paper.
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
the strength gained through my own hard work is truly fulfilling. hehe, thanks for your support.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this...
huh, this little guy looks familiar... ah! are you arlan's peppy? awwww i'm sowwie, your master isn't here. he's gone off to investigate~
hey, look, it's mister giovanni!
i get it now. you knew about their plans all along. you only told us they were doing badly so that we'd drop our guard...
chasing and waiting -- maybe that's what life's all about...
but if nothing else, i know that we must avoid another war at all costs. the people cannot be made to suffer like that again.
although, if what dan heng said is true, i doubt something that could swallow the express would be a picky eater...
let's stop their insanity first, then settle the score with them!
nah~ i was just imagining all the fun we're gonna have here... hee-hee!
after all, it'd probably be impossible to find it and ask my question in person...
oh uh, i'm sorry, we were just curious.
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
since it's a classic puzzle, the answer is... "people," right?
...the tea party turned out to be even more difficult than i'd imagined...
have you all considered this? perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned akivili never reached...
(what i must do next is recreate the truth, what cowell did, and how he went from would-be perpetrator to victim.)
actually, i didn't defeat master yanqing...
oh, no... no, i'm fine.
so... the auction didn't go too well, huh?
wow, i never knew there was such a large lake here. it's so beautiful...
maybe it's because the crystal has a very close connection to forbidden knowledge which causes memories of it to be unclear.
among the countless legends surrounding the house of daena, the wisdom seelie is one of the more popular ones lately...
of course you should! why wouldn't you?
so, this must be an adepti abode... hmm, though it's a bit different from what i imagined, it's still most fascinating.
alright, i'll wait for you here. make it quick, though. i can tell you some other stories when you return.
later, this puppet wandered inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until... the fatui took an interest in him.
aha, the next treasure map just came in by text -- let's get a move on. we need to hunt down the next pass!
ugh...
just wait until you're a bit older, hook -- then you can go wherever you want~
it seems that from the very beginning, they've been guarding against info leaks from the akasha. of course, it could also be because they're wary of me.
i'm sorry, my dear. my dream dance partner... i've already got sights on someone else.
hehe, what a relief. *yawn* this is truly the most exhausting birthday i've ever had.
my legs are so sore... *sigh* guess i must have been sleepwalking last night... again.
why not think about it this way. our trailblazing expeditions are turning into "blast expeditions," where we eat, drink, and play wherever we go.
don't let anything hold you back. make the most of this opportunity and ask away!
i knew i couldn't hide it from you.
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
any funny antics in the house of daena will get you escorted out... or perhaps thrown out.
wonderful. then i'll see you in three days. i look forward to it very much.
hmm... would someone really go to all this trouble just to pull off some prank? i can't make heads or tails of it.
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know...
beautiful! great performance!
alright. goodbye then, urakusai.
hahaha, i was just kidding. be on your way, now.
since this offer comes from those who left us to our fate for more than a decade... how would you react if wildfire refused? hmm? would you use force?
(it seems like every character included in the script has a certain amount of useful information to offer. if we keep asking questions, we might be able to get some good leads.)
i want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. it meant a lot to me.
s--sorry for bothering you! please, i need your help...
apep is the most adaptable life-form in the world. the forbidden knowledge should've become a part of its body a long time ago.
i trusted vache with all my heart. funny, isn't it? and pathetic.
everything is turbulent and disordered... if you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
you know as well as i do that she's always been like this. why start fretting about it now?
i'm so sorry mom... i'm so sorry. for ten years, i left you both in the overworld. mister oswell, i'm sorry you had to bear all this weight.
my, my, who have we here?
usually, i'm pretty picky about whether the place has any pesky bugs flying around...
...fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
what's this road of wisdom, and who's the child?
i just wanted to talk to you briefly about what happened in the opera house. i'm sure you saw everything too, right?
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity... based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
yeah. i can't ever tell my classmates about that. i'd be a mess if they ever reported it to my adviser...
but tell me, why should this concern me? why should i do this for you, when i already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
does this not clear all doubt?
i've heard some things... but i'm not purposely asking around or anything, don't worry!
...that includes me, too.
oh? well if you're quite sure, then of course. now, i shall send you on your way.
oh, i see. was i sleepwalking? i was, wasn't i?
when that ambition disappeared, he began to doubt himself. as he battled his growing anxiety... he slowly descended into the state you see him in now.
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
i know. you can't wait to join the finals of the belobog representative qualifiers. but gepard isn't a pushover either.
each opportunity for growth is unique in its own way.
using my knowledge of the akasha, i have a way to extract your consciousness from here and put it inside a knowledge capsule.
the look on your face is practically screaming "i'm the one behind all this..."
still, if that's how i beat him... it'd be a little less... satisfying.
...time to head back to the goethe hotel for a good night's sleep!
*sigh* alright, no more buts... my life is a mess because of the decisions i've made for myself. i should listen to your advice this time.
(the deceased's name is cowell, lyney's assistant. he would've been able to tamper with the equipment...)
oh, well if it isn't colter! back already from the fortress of meropide?
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
sure enough, it didn't show up.
huh? ah... i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
pfft! as if anyone would ever believe that!
as a guest from afar, there's no need to be so formal.
play as... a god?
these memories will show you the raw truth, but be aware that enemies may react just like in the real world. please be careful.
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
...huh, that's weird. i bet the conductor won, right?
hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in inazuma. they even handed out flyers in front of yae publishing house.
awwww he's so cute!!!
think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
(the fonta promoter has been struggling because he doesn't recognize the real value of coupons. meanwhile, the duke believes that only idiots who don't understand the value of coupons will spend them on fonta.)
well, i'm sad, yes, but i can't just go back and plop myself into a chair by the roadside and do nothing.
haha, i just assumed you must've gotten yourself a pet puppy.
by the way, yanqing, where are we headed next?
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those...
yeah, there are still tons of issues to fix. it certainly hasn't been easy.
some people travel all over the world in order to create art that resonates with all of teyvat.
yeah, wherever we go, we eat, play, and have a blast!
hey, wait! just think about what you're doing! and... don't mention our names if something goes wrong! ugh, i hope they don't get into trouble... this is nerve-wracking.
...if she was there too then... i understand. she wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? clara's always been a kind-hearted girl...
but it'll be risky if we use the fire seed again.
honestly, spending an entire night waiting for something that we're not sure is gonna happen might not be the best use of our time...
w--well then! if it wasn't lyney who committed the crimes, then who was it?
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
i understand! in the immersia, the disciple and the master share both honor and disgrace. if the apprentice fails, the master loses face, too.
we're finally here. the entrance should be nearby...
but before that, i wanted to tell you the truth about your past. if all i wanted to do was use you, then i'd be no different from the doctor.
hey seele, and... sampo's guests. so, it looks like you've already met.
you've managed to make a guy like him turn over a new leaf. you're amazing, mister tail!
yeah, it's been days since i've had a good night's sleep.
mm-hmm. i found it in the sanctuary of surasthana, but i have no recollection of it whatsoever.
once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
the crystal that i have in my possession is probably the key that links the two matters together.
it's okay, it isn't your fault. i don't think it's a coincidence that neither of you can remember anything about the crystal.
i really want to help the others, but most of the time i'm barely scraping by myself... there's very little i can help with...
but i preferred the character design of the deputy sheriff. can it come back?
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
woah, they really pulled out all the stops for this new script!
let us return. we ought not keep furuyama waiting too long.
the only reason i ever chose to study astrology is because of how beautiful the stars are at night, that's all.
wait, this part on the last page sounds strangely familiar...
hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
it's the same situation with the ley lines. the parts of them that are hidden underground can be identified via elemental energy, sound, and other phenomena.
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
anyway, enough of that. let's hurry and catch up to setaria.
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but... what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
don't be surprised. my job is just to help everyone make the right calls.
we've already come this far together. i'd like to join you for the rest of your journey on penacony. i'm pleased that we can finally fight shoulder-to-shoulder -- i couldn't ask for a better ending.
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
ahem, speaking of good sides with sake, i personally prefer fried tofu...
i'm just out looking for some leads while getting some fresh air.
after all, we don't allow illegal or unethical profiteering. in fact, our funds often come from the citizenry who support us.
don't wander off, the judge is still watching us...
natasha! oleg! hope you didn't have to wait too long.
haha, how could i forget about you two? we couldn't have done it without your help.
do make the most of your trip here, won't you? quite a lot has changed.
yes, the story is the reason i agreed to join. i can't bear to even imagine what this film would look like without the very best director.
w-what's miss black swan doing here?
plus, now that someone has shut one of the disruptors down, the contrast between before and after can provide me with further information still.
oh! also, rubbing alcohol. i kept a bunch at the orphanage, since the kids often got into tussles. i didn't bring it with me when i left... i hope it's still intact.
and wouldn't such a trick be the most marvelous finale to today's performance?
(aw, good thing i made all those preparations. seems the all-nighter i pulled last night is really paying off!)
anyway, get ready! lights, kamera, action!
don't worry, i'm not trying to pry, and i wouldn't let something like that affect what i think of you.
come on... stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
sounds like an amazing treasure!
well, what do we have here?
...you really have a knack for asking the most uncomfortable questions, don't you...
also, wouldn't this mean he has been spending a whole lot of mora and energy to fight his own sinthe business?
we've already done everything we can, and we even found the true culprit...
fists, palms, and fingers... *gasp* rock, paper, scissors! phew! no wonder i was confused!
but when i opened my eyes, the feeling was gone without a trace.
yep, that's the plan. oh, actually, since we talked about the reconstruction earlier, wanna come with me and check out the town for yourself?
i have some words to share with you, though they were spoken to me by miss acheron. she said that "the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen..."
that's right! if the images are in chronological order, shouldn't the fourth -- the waters drowning fontaine -- come before the third, where the hydro archon herself falls into the water?
even with the erebus, you must've put in a lot of effort to get such a good price?
not long, luka. best brace yourself.
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
huh? wh--what do you mean?
hehe, very good. you've learned a lot since we last met.
(then, we'll analyze where it's been sighted and its motives... finally, we'll piece everything together...)
you guys sure have a toxic company culture over at the ipc...
don't push yourself too hard! just leave if you can't handle it!
hmm, off to a most unfavorable start.
since you're here... i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
wanna have a pillow fight later? huh? huh? i bet they're stuffed with goose feathers, haha!
will the destruction of a gnosis attract the attention of the heavenly principles? and if so... how do the fatui plan to deal with the consequences?
are such haphazard instructions really okay...
...huh? is that my phone? must be the group chat.
i stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
alright, i won't disturb you two any longer. bye-bye, now.
they won the archon war together, and when baal established the shogunate, beelzebul became her kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." in other words, she acted as baal's body double.
wait, shall we have a farewell meal? you know, to commemorate our time as partners?
the fortress of meropide was nearly flooded with primordial seawater, which we know can cause fontainians to dissolve. it seems increasingly likely that the prophecy may come true.
i'm very interested in your future. it's a journey that can't be observed or recorded by this world...
*sigh* i can't remember the last time i got such a polite response.
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder...
i know you want to communicate with someone beyond the islands, but you can't do that right now. so i cut off your connection.
alright, let's go! time to interview the witness!
such a small fragment of consciousness can't last for very long, though. it will return to its original dream...
...do you have a driver's license?
the silvermane girl? she's pretty. i like looking at her.
during the tatarasuna incident, niwa was murdered by the doctor, disguised as a mechanic. the balladeer, then known as the kabukimono, disappeared not long after.
that should be the heart of oasis. all we need to do is "light" it with the fire seed and it'll restore apep with elemental power.
no time for guesses! let's just head to rivet town and find gepard first.
hang on a sec, isn't that wallace up ahead? looks like he's finally made some friends! i wonder what they're talking about...
we were just wondering if you could help us find somebody...
it's the stellaron hunter girl... i can see her on the big screen, but where is she in the arena?
readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. if we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
uh... i think we strayed off topic. how did things even get to this point?
all of this is thanks to makoto's power. her understanding of eternity is much more profound than mine.
ah! you're just in time -- we haven't taken our selfie today.
are you saying... you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?
you mustn't hesitate -- recover every last reagent that vache left behind. i'll take responsibility for the consequences -- don't worry about that.
not bad... the actors' emotions were all on point, let's keep that take.
if it wasn't for your encouragement, i probably would've quit halfway through and holed up in the akademiya somewhere...
only two more... isn't that super risky? ahh! i don't wanna become an ice cube floating around in space again!
wait, what? no way -- we're about to leave and i've hardly got any decent photos.
"sparkle has disguised herself as another character"... wouldn't that be you, mister sampo?
after all, the akademiya should still be unable to confirm the existence of my consciousness in the outside world.
do you say this because you have not yet reconciled yourself with your defeat?
seriously... i just spent so much time thinking about my dream, but he didn't even ask me!
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
the shogun's army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this shuumatsuban ninja, i'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
...why would you suddenly ask a question like that?
i could've stepped in to help that family... "would it have ended differently... if i were just a little braver?"
what!? argenti wants to leave the express and fight the giant sting alone!?
you know, it's common courtesy to make sure the homeowner isn't in earshot when you're denigrating their abode.
seriously!? you actually speak trotter?
as you can imagine, the conclusions that the evidence points to are not mutually exclusive. which means... this is probably another prank from miss sparkle.
i should've known... don't quit your day job.
are you guys also here to catch the festivities? oh, and that reminds me, happy lantern rite!
if it's so simple, why didn't your master diviner come and do it herself?
why, of course i do. allow me to take the first shot and break this case wide open. mister lyney is clearly lying.
hehe, it's my duty to protect sumeru's citizens, after all.
there is a chance that it could avoid that end, using the power of something here...
do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the sacred sakura's roots?
the thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free... oh, i just couldn't wait any longer.
i saw some memory fragments drifting outside the window, and i intend to salvage them.
don't take this the wrong way, but... doesn't the house of daena have a door?
...well, passing the buck is one way to handle this.
really! let's go catch up with him!
previous research has revealed that forbidden knowledge is the root cause of the withering.
while i want to live, i'm never afraid of death. the opposite of death is eternal life, and that's... something i'll never desire.
isn't this... a sword technique? shouldn't i be saying something cool?
we're here to help sort out miss tingyun's things. madam yukong wants to use some of them for her soul-soothing ceremony.
i'm feeling like... there's another world in front of my eyes...
i suppose that's to be expected, though. if a single conversation's all that's needed to find them out, then my father wouldn't have needed to investigate the case for so many years.
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
he died from his illness while he was still very young. the balladeer came home one day and found that he had stopped breathing.
*sigh* ...why is it always me...
since the moment it was built, the grand theater has graced the entire dreamscape with its rendition of the odes of harmony.
i'm thinking... if i have the chance, i'd love to travel with you and see what lies beyond jarilo-vi.
oh, that's great! then i'll leave the ingredient gathering to you. as long as we have some sweet flowers and wheat, i can start the baking.
take, par exemple, how this troupe pines for their late director... things such as this i have never witnessed before. and so, i should like to observe, perchance to understand.
it's okay, no need to push yourself. we'll ask around some more, see if there are any valuable clues elsewhere.
i used to have a much wider range of choices when it came to food, but now, i'm finding that simple, traditional home cooking can be quite delicious too.
you know, if you think everything through, uncle marcel is indeed the most suspicious of them all...
foreboding signs can also be superficial. you may have good fortune after riding out the storm.
yep, that's how i feel as well. anyway, now that we've sent them packing, we don't have to worry about those guys anymore.
it's even possible that this entire world is a lie, and the history of the whole world has just been one endless sabzeruz festival.
come on. we'll need to get the go-ahead from neuvillette -- i know just where to find him.
and once i have figured out the truth and stepped up to the challenge, i will do what this opera house cannot, and restore my father's truth and honor back to him!
just think of it as keeping me company. how does that sound?
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
just head back to the fleuve cendre and have a rest, then. thanks for keeping me company all this time.
miss topaz! miss asta!
there were actually more avidya leopards sleeping nearby, and they were all faster than me... i almost got bitten a couple of times.
if you're curious about vache's wonder medicine, you should ask some of the patients in the clinic... see what they have to say about the effects.
hey, miss qingque, care to get involved!?
i-it's you? why were you just in my room...
as far as i know, apep had been slumbering in the desert, and king deshret had taken a great interest in it. maybe this is why apep was contaminated.
as for what that is... well, let's start by saying that we'll be pooling our efforts together to create a series of "traps."
*ahem* i mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
i went all out when i was acting as an archon, so why wouldn't i do the same for my own life?
you want to save the people of inazuma from the vision hunt decree. so do i. the only difference is that i'd rather like to save this nation and save ei while we're at it.
the result... patients with mild illness would attribute their recovery to the so-called wonder medicine, while patients with serious illness would quickly deteriorate... and sometimes die.
in some ways, they aren't wrong. greater lord rukkhadevata was omniscient and omnipotent. even after her death, the akasha is still empowering this nation.
heh, i'm only telling you this so you can properly understand my plan. could you possibly spare the sentimentality for the time being?
yeah! see, the two of us would never have misunderstandings like this.
sorry, i... i just...
oh, okay, i see. so ei's decided to palm inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date...
if i were to ever discard anything so pure, i don't think i'd ever be able to find a place to anchor myself in the vast sea of knowledge.
thank you. i've heard a lot of sad stories along this journey, and several of them have touched my heart.
i'll get close to them while you make your way over from above.
that's a silvermane guard. is he yelling at us?
yeah, i remember hearing this world was invaded by the legion hundreds of years ago.
i didn't expect to meet you here. we were just talking about tails...
dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? after all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of teyvat.
(...oh? how interesting. those two managed to deduce quite a lot through guesswork alone.)
it's like... like a fight between two friends. if they don't agree to see each other and talk in person, isn't it possible that the friendship could end entirely?
melus and silver have helped me so much, but by contrast, i could do nothing for them.
...imagination is the source of all existence. children need only their imagination to understand the express.
what was the point of him dying without sharing any of the secrets he knew? did he manage to protect anything in the end?
the express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for me!
yeah, i've been trying to think of a place that fits the description of its homeland, but i'm unable to come up with anything.
we shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of penacony or the family.
go ahead and give it a try, little layla. don't worry, the little ones and i will be here to keep you safe.
something on your mind again? let's work through it together. two heads are better than one.
don't worry, i haven't forgotten. i will be sure to remind the tenryou and yashiro commissions of their duties in this regard.
come on! don't think like that! leave the adult matters to the adults. even if you wanted to do something for the general, it's not like you can do anything.
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
hmm? whatever are you talking about? i don't understand. i'm simply here for the book review session with miss sole of the deep.
huh?! robin? but i thought she... oh, right! if firefly is here safe and sound, then it means robin must be okay, too.
there should be a lamp nearby. inserting a thermic core should do the trick.
thank you for being so kind. i know that you mean it, and i'll make the most of my stay here.
my "origin," huh... i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
it was a choice... the pursuit of arduous labor for the survival of our entire civilization.
your memories are still scrambled? try your best to remember. this isn't the first time we've met, and i answered that question a long time ago.
...every once in a while, i will also take up the duties of the god of wisdom, and enlighten a lost soul here and there. doing all that... should be enough.
i, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. approved.
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
okay, here we go...
from now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. and after all the experience they've gained, i'm sure they are more than up to the task.
is that so? well, in any case, i just feel like even in your personal life, you don't get emotional very often.
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
so, if i were to take on that ipc guy now, what would you say are my chances?
we've come so far! you can't just tell me that the last hurdle is some impossible foe. that's just not fair.
it's been sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust for far too long. but now i've finally got the chance to wear it!
it's possible that the fatui have other information that even i don't know about. and since the balladeer used to be one of them, he'll be better acquainted with this information than i am.
interesting events like "a moment of dreams" don't happen every day, after all. no matter how busy things are, i'd still set aside some time to check it out.
...i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct...
excuse me, is the deputy sheriff still around?
what are you? and where did you come from?
even after we found out about his mysterious past, he's still the same dan heng we've always known!
if he really is the one setting up the conspiracy, it'd be best if he's exposed as soon as possible.
safe to say, were it not for my previous experiences in combat, my skills would not have been up to the challenge. i would most certainly have been defeated.
if all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then clockie's counterpart is definitely the watchmaker.
weird stuff like this happens a couple of times a week. and it's bad luck for the one who hears it: it means you'll flunk your next exam.
you asked me this question before. my answer was: "it would literally blow your minds."
oh? so you do know that name.
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm... wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
descendant of the kujou clan. your turn.
but i wonder if there's any way to go deeper into the dream...
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
what a shame i didn't get to see it for myself.
it's okay! let him go.
whew... that was tough!
are you sure? isn't there something else that you haven't asked about yet?
looks like she also sent you a message...
but recently, people realized that the goddess didn't reveal anything about what's supposed to happen after peace has been restored.
see, skott? looks like your bros have different ideas of what "family" means.
*sigh* i calmed down and thought about it a bit. if it turns out that woman isn't lying, then a lot of innocent people are gonna get hurt... now's the time for thinking about other people... hehe *sigh*
it all happened so suddenly... but looking back, i think mister yang was right. tingyun was behaving strangely -- she was fascinated with the abundance's creations.
i also can't quite figure out why things feel a little off... but, now that we're here, let's go ahead and meet her as we planned.
of course, the gardes might eventually figure out the truth of the matter, and determine that we were in the right...
as guuji of the grand narukami shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. only then am i capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
wow, how perceptive... does she have invisible antennae?
hey, enough with the passive aggression!
that's why i want to rehearse and practice presenting my points in front of someone.
it is the cradle of my vitality, and the meaning of my birth. and for the longest time, it was... how i should have looked to the rest of the world.
with a true heart and focused mind -- here i come!
well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. you're right on time, too.
(maybe i should just go back...)
oho, impressive! you could tell it was me from that far away! you've got good ears!
so if you don't mind, i'll go and take a look at the other patients?
and with that, marcel's motive has now been established...
i have a question for you, miss chevreuse. would you be willing to play the role of a musketeer?
marquises... expensive...
the surroundings are different from before. the stage decorations... look a bit tidier now?
no matter how disgusting the dish, you gotta summon your trailblazing spirit and face it! not gonna lie though, jellied eels and himeko's coffee are pretty tough to stomach...
*whine*... my stamina's running low... let's keep the volume down.
of course, your honor. the two cases are connected via a matter of timing.
it's actually pretty rare for someone to actively engage in a conversation with me like you do.
where did you come from little one? is your dad around?
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
in life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching...
"mecha"... what an intriguing statement. i recall the bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal -- "a tall male in silver armor."
(i remember there was something else within the inner layer of that box...)
shh -- you're being annoying! i'm not kidding -- this is straight out of the book.
i would like to check the registration records of a kshahrewar scholar. he should be in an unconscious state right now.
uh-uh-uh, it seems that you're forgetting, this is the grand narukami shrine...
b--but we can't just run away like this, right...
in the end, i simply had to accept that it was a miraculous effect of makoto's consciousness.
time is running out. we need to hurry.
no, not at all. don't be so nervous, i'm just here to look around.
they've jacked up security alright... how the heck are we gonna sneak in? serval, we need one of those brainwaves.
fine, well if you're dead-set on doing something for me, you can treat me to a meal.
yes... melus did say that charging straight in there would be extremely risky, but we don't have any other options right now...
now, let's leave this place... please close your eyes.
according to a popular theory from the vahumana darshan of the akademiya, rejecting impractical motions at the beginning of a planning session will give more weight to the actual proposal.
your ailments need rational, scientific treatment. relying on pseudo-medicines will only worsen your condition...
yep. i will help you save the messages. it should be pretty easy to use. i just can't guarantee the user's status and signal coverage when they're outside the city...
where is he now? does he have plans to visit inazuma? if so, i will instruct one of the commissioners to bring him to me on his arrival. i would very much like to spar with him.
(hehe, that's part of it. plus, we're all friends. there's nothing wrong with us talking like this once in a while.)
please don't share any of this with her. i would like to keep this a secret, for both of our sakes.
he couldn't keep hating humans after that. and if he thought there was a chance he could save his old friends, it would be hard not to try.
...i take back what i said. we have to hurry to that memory zone where miss firefly's presence was imprinted. considering what this person can do...
i believe this is indeed the "finale."
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
the world remains constant over the centuries. but human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. transitory.
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
hmm, could this have been the suspect's escape route?
huh, there's a cash prize?
she'll probably wake up soon... no doubt she'll be a little disoriented at first, but once she's got her bearings, she'll go and report that she shut down this disruptor.
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
mm... i'm okay. if i were in his shoes, i may well have had the same reaction. now i need to focus on treating the patients, and dispelling their doubts.
"don't look back. keep going forward..." i get it! if i do the exact opposite -- i'll find my way out! you're a true genius, march.
wow, that's a pretty incredible story. so... does that mean topaz's "business" here is to collect a debt from belobog?
then i'll leave that to you. macaroni's on sale today, so i've got to go. you can just tell me how things went when we discuss tomorrow's plan later.
yeah, that's usually how it goes.
oh, nothing, nothing! it was just a meal, y'know. nothin' the spina di rosula can't cover, haha... *sigh*
there's also the saying: "from misfortune comes bliss."
that's just the work of my subconscious mind...
while my papa was stiff like a board, my mother was supposedly super cheerful and funny. their complementary personalities allowed them to make up for each other's flaws.
i understand that you're upset, sir! we'll leave soon, i promise. it's just, if we don't know where to find the monsters, we won't even know where to go...
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
i'm sure you already know how to use this.
hehe, i won't be modest this time. my skills have improved by leaps and bounds!
what was certain, however, was that it would paint a gigantic target on my back.
mister yang, do you mean... the stellaron is making the ambrosial arbor grow?
unlike me, makoto was no martial artist. whenever similar crises had arisen in the past, i was always the one to face them in her stead.
i'm sorry things are getting all bleak and serious... let me see what i can do to lighten the mood.
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
also, i'm fairly certain that hilichurls can't write stories. so does this author claim to be documenting hilichurl life from an outside perspective, perhaps?
witness... the will of the weak!
anyway, the perspective advocated by the sages drowned out any voices of doubt.
ahaha, you're too kind... wait, you're giving me a gift? shouldn't it be the other way round?
i'll get myself together on the way, so please don't worry!
i shall not go back on my word. i have committed to giving it to you, what you choose to do with it is your business. you are quite free to give it to somebody else, if you wish.
i really don't know what's going on, but for now, i'm calling the phenomenon a "blessing from the stars."
i can only give you surface-level help, like bits of information and subtle hints. for the rest of the time, i'll be doing all i can to slow down dunyarzad's illness.
she even used her last remnant of lucid consciousness to leave a clue for us to follow...
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
they... set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
hold up a second! i need to think...
hehe, oh i see! well, how wonderfully comedic, to have your own counterattack only to come back and wound you!
those highfalutin folk are not all-knowing. that's why we exist, to seep into the cracks where filth falls through, where their watch fails them. that's the kinds of problems we solve.
hmm, so technically speaking, it's not that you won't wake up -- it's that you can't wake up.
indeed. no longer will i ignore their passions and dreams.
the vision hunt decree has my tacit approval.
...uh, i'm not sure it's as poetic as that...
i never knew pela had a strict side...
although, if clara hadn't been here... svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
we'll see who wins next time. what do you say, miss "sole of the deep"? how about a rematch?
alright, i've written down all the possible questions that i think the advisers might ask. next, i'll put together a few words of encouragement for her.
some kind of seal was cast upon me, and i lost my power.
wow! you won something on your first attempt! impressive!
it's been over a decade since the silvermane guards withdrew from the underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. the only contact we have is the exchange of geomarrow for goods.
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
yes, i agree. although the pay is well below what someone of my caliber deserves, a great script calls for a great director.
yes, for five hundred years now, ever since the cataclysm in khaenri'ah. there's been no sign of activity...
unpopular? what are you talking about? who in aurum alley wouldn't like a cheerful and adorable young lady like me?
why is everyone in such a hurry? i hope nothing's happened at the hotel...
i'm sorry for interrupting your beautiful dreams. i may have acted a little cold when handling things in the dream. i sincerely apologize for that.
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
i was wondering, madam herta, why did you become a championship contender?
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
eh-he, to be honest, we don't actually know...
so, they found a fungus that matches the description i gave them. it's currently unconscious.
yes. actually, i heard that you were voted in as well, tighnari. how do you deal with it?
i suppose what it comes down to is the definition of "eternity" she set out with.
alright everyone, we've got a wrap for tulipe and iris!
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
is that some kind of riddle? "reverence to the three talons..." what the heck does that mean?
great, then i'll prep the stove. let's get to work, everyone!
the moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of eternity. i shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
it's a whole row of those gate robots! we saw one in the divination commission...
but the shogun is still running based on her old rules. i can't allow her to make any more mistakes while i am working things out.
you must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
bye-bye now. come again soon.
there's that huge pillar called the furnace core that's always in view -- maybe it's some kind of energy hub?
(but... if things don't play out as expected, the people of fontaine will be the ones to pay the price...!)
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
you said external forces might be messing with my head, right? that just makes me more curious. hmph, no one gets away with locking up my memories! let's go. i'll show you the way to goethe hotel!
woo! is that it? looks like we solved all the puzzles in this victory zone.
i can't decipher his intentions right now... but based solely on the question, i would probably choose to build that dove a cage...
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
actually, i already have someone in mind. do you still remember that female scholar named setaria?
you think so? well, to that, i would say that in sumeru, even prisoners have the right to an education.
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
so... what does wildfire do all day?
i have powers related to dreams, so it's usually easy for me to tell who's dreaming and who's created by dreams.
look! there's a crowd gathering over there. is the address starting soon?
but as long as i use my elemental power to stabilize it a little, it shouldn't be a problem.
you'd better go to the bathroom...
but he never gave testimony or any information regarding people dissolving in the primordial seawater. could he have been threatened...?
it's virtually impossible to destroy a stellaron. no one, not even herta, has found a way to break its structure. the best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
i need to go to the cave below the grand narukami shrine.
bronya? are you okay?
hehe, i hear that question a lot -- seems like he owes everyone something. that's why he never discloses his whereabouts.
perhaps... perhaps i've been holding on to everything too tightly.
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
but of course. that's why i'm here waiting for you.
umm, okay... i'll try to swim over there.
i'd like to try to hit him with my sword.
oh! that's right, i almost forgot...
what's wrong, bronya? do you feel sick?
that the fonta tasted "kinda salty and icky."
however, i've heard from the citizens here that the goddess hasn't given out any new revelations in a very long time.
back at the yashiro commission, i kept the conversation reasonably light-hearted. but now... i'd like to broach a heavier topic, if i may.
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
it was so grand and awe-inspiring... pictures of the city simply don't do it any justice.
no worries, just thought you might be interested.
is that... mister giovanni?
i didn't do much, just helped you leave the memory zone.
serval! we came past here before and helped you fix a few things, remember?
"stairs made of coins can lead to happiness." does this mean we can take it? i'm not sure if it's a good deal... but thank you anyway!
a classic tale of youth and friendship. it never gets old.
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
it might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
really? i've never been able to do it successfully myself!
yeah, if they've been planning this for ages, they're definitely not going to let this opportunity slip by.
c'mon, let's go talk to it and get the first treasure map.
so... help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
there, there. you're doing great. have a headpat.
i should thank you for lending us your sword there, clorinde. but before i do so, could you explain how you managed to show up here?
miko... the people of inazuma are afraid of me...
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
bingo... *sigh* the pressure from my studies and debt was crushing me, and i didn't want to tell my family about any of it.
the pleasure is all mine... i can't thank you enough.
looks like she kept a detailed record of her captor's actions. she even mentions the truth behind the "experiments" on dissolving young women.
of course not! what were you thinking?
mercenaries rely heavily on muscle memory. and dehya was able to use her experiences to avoid injury in later samsara cycles.
is it a message from mister giovanni?
i...
oh, before i forget... navia, the short sword you had with you earlier...
thanks, you two. that makes me feel a lot better. let's move on to the next question, shall we?
are you really from the divination commission?
pfft! as if anyone wants your junkyard scrap mechs!
oh? hello there, little ones.
perhaps it's because... i'm the electro archon's familiar.
i might, however... become even smaller.
and then you start to doubt yourself, and wonder if you've lost that drive... if everything were to happen again, would you still stand strong?
...seriously? you're questioning me like this is a court case now. i don't know anything about that.
hmm. so even i, who seeks eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence...
due to my lack of sleep, i sometimes get dizzy and faint when i'm stressed out...
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
let's explore around. be careful, everyone.
...you and i have both witnessed the great loss that progress can bring.
we were both sad, and conflicted, and totally overthinking everything as a result, haha.
everyone seems so devoted to the troupe. i'm sure if you keep chipping away, you'll find a way through.
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me..."
but even then, that doesn't necessarily mean that i'm actually the wisdom seelie. it could have just helped me while i was sleepwalking.
i'll tell you everything once the whole truth has been revealed.
so, you're here for pauleau? looks like he could be a while, so feel free to take a stroll around town in the meantime. i've made all the arrangements already.
if they manage to blow up the aquabus line, all that rubble will come crashing down the hill and straight into poisson!
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few... it's just like a hidden message... left by someone for the nameless.
but as the magic-makers and stars of the show, i think i should leave the final performance to you.
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
thank you, that would be very helpful.
well... if you're okay, let's move on to the next stop, which is just a stone's throw away from here. please follow me...
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair...
...never again would it cherish a single creature, nor a single blade of grass that stood on that mountain. the kitten spent the nights wandering aimlessly, gnashing its teeth at the moon.
negotiate with me? i heard you had already left sumeru. why are you here again now?
i didn't know he had leftover reagents in rivet town. i was shocked when you told me.
perfect! let's go relax and just let the day pass by!
the dream is spiraling out of control and is collapsing now
hmm... ah yes, we'll need a formal organization with a catchy name before we go out and start helping people... why don't we call it the spina di rosula?
(i feel utterly exhausted. best to rest early today, too.)
the reason is simple: in this grandiose and ostentatious dream of the family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
oh, serval! so she's gepard's older sister!
what do you mean by that? you expected me to just keep running and hiding from my responsibility forever?
alright, these should be enough.
only kids sit around like this, waiting for the stars to appear...
and more fashionably dressed, too... hey, is he about to leave? what about the girl in red?
hehe, no need. don't you underestimate the leader of wildfire.
yes. what is making her so nervous?
*sigh* oh, we meet again.
i am the only one in all of inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
hehehe, oh, but i have so much to say to you. let me tell you all that has happened over the last few centuries.
oh, i see. the adventurers' guild is open to everyone's commissions, so she might have some ideas.
hmm? what's stopping you? not still traumatized from your last encounter, are you?
...that's just my charm! and i didn't cause any trouble. you just have to get used to me... look, dan heng agrees, right?
(assertive, with a strong sense of presence, one who can dispel all doubt... that is the character i'm fated to play...)
of course, there's no doubt about that. so, i'll be sending someone i trust to go with you.
an--and then what happened??
people love watching the evil turn over a new leaf, but they also enjoy watching good people fall into an abyss from one slip-up just as much.
there's no need to take such great pains. if you just want confirmation... i've already told you the answer, miss sparkle.
i'm not so good at analyzing people, but seeing as you asked...
there's one final part here... i only received it late last night.
(nobody has ever deceived you like that, paimon. it's natural that you find it difficult to understand. perhaps he needed to learn this someday.)
huh!? so it's you! you're the one who was threatening to take us out in the snow plains!
it's not that i "know everything." it's just that i've been in your position before.
wait a sec, did gepard say that he's in rivet town? could that mean topaz is...
but the spina is very different now. she mustered up the courage to talk to me, and felt like i could really understand her.
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
oh? well, if that's the case, then... fine, i'll spare you the lecture about your attitude just now.
ooh, how about the city square! follow me!
this is the place that immediately came to mind when the hint mentioned a crossroad.
after a moment, he'd start to smile. it really surprised me at the time... my guess is that the names on the handle were of important people to him.
hahahaha! ...very good, my people. only ones such as you are deserving of my rule.
without you, without any of you... i would have been in a much more difficult situation.
many people dread the sound of thunder... to me, it sounds fondly familiar.
um, it's just something i read in an academic publication. i really love to read mona's essays...
oh, would you? but it would be too much to ask you to go on a trip just for those...
oh, thank you so much. i really needed this.
(the load was far beyond what he expected, but the balladeer survived... he left the furnace in sheer exhaustion and said to the mechanic: "this device seems to have protected me. what's in it?")
the thunderstorm is getting out of control? this is the first i've heard of it.
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
how could a dream bubble be empty?
a witness... ah, yes. i've heard that you came to teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? in other words, you never belonged here...
so my plan is... to incite rebellion in the tenryou commission.
that should be it... the flow of time is endlessly cycling within one single day.
...i should pay a visit to my father's grave, and tell him the truth of what happened, as well as how it all ended.
as i've said before, i'm still learning, and cannot fully empathize with the pain of all the loss you've experienced.
*sigh* and we were having so much fun investigating with you, too...
hehe, i'm sure they've known about me. to be honest, i'm shocked it's taken them this long to act against me.
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
a world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the garden of recollection...
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
this puzzle has life and death at stake... it could determine irminsul's fate... as well as teyvat's...
good afternoon! where's my cake? what? i just had cake for breakfast? well, i think it's been long enough!
...what the actual heck is she saying?
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
happy birthday! let's celebrate together and make it a moment to remember for the whole year until your next birthday celebration, and so on and so forth. then, you shall have an eternity of happiness.
unless blizzard immunity is real...
...huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
you still don't remember? what about "findie"? that's one of their products... oh and the interastral peace broadcast! y'know, the one always being played on the express!
tsk, tsk, that's against the rules! i can't let them get their way!
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
"stars hung from its branches..." then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
leaving the city... as far as i remember, you've mentioned your plans to do that twice before...
then my duty as her eternal familiar is to drag her back out of her own head and into the real world.
oops, she's heard us...
well, i was never beaten up by jing yuan in reality, either...
alright, that's quite enough, melus. anyway, i like your answer. you pass with flying colors!
i'm just saying! it'll be a shame if they get smashed to pieces.
it's extremely difficult for lab rats in an experiment to understand why they're being treated the way they are.
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
mm-hmm. you may remember me mentioning that the fatui had not included your twin's details in the "descender" category. this is an extremely important point.
miko, come on... no need to put them on the spot like that.
that's right. and even if she had tampered with the setup, she would need to understand the entire trick to pull it off.
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
yeah, now that we've got a plan, there's no point in waiting. the longer this drags on, the worse it will be for everybody.
the cart is about to depart!
could there be other things similar to what yanming got? we should take a look.
oh... there's no need to apologize! you had nothing to do with it. and, anyway, everything she did was for a good cause.
this is why i wish to befriend all of you. a place where nightmares and sweet dreams intersect... the perfect cradle for the remembrance.
hey, i'm not actually gonna recite a poem! i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived on the xianzhou...
#{nickname}, get the kamera ready! paimon, get the clapperboard! actors, to your positions! we're about to start shooting the first scene!
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
so what are you all doing here? do you need something?
(but is that really why they support me? is their kindness... real?)
...*sigh* we need to work on your emotional intelligence.
you might say your mental fatigue has already answered this question. eventually, there is only so much that people can tolerate.
just how much work did you do to force me onto this stage?
(lyney did not take part in the underground altercation. he only witnessed traces of the aftermath.)
come back, come back, they won't be hiding that far away!
this game is truly unpredictable...
"ultimately auspicious..." wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
afterwards, wildfire began to grow. to be honest, i never thought a day like this would come.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice... could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze...
it's someone you know. wanna take a guess?
wait, so she... handed an actual sword to a child? isn't that dangerous!? did you hurt yourself?
okay. let's just hope we won't get him into trouble...
got any more encouraging words?
puppets are stiff and can't copy a living person's vitality. after all, they're just there as filler.
this moment has finally come... i always get stuck here for a long time, but it also means i'm getting to the endpoint.
i see. thank you so much.
i'm here to save both you and your people. my people.
...but what can i even do, other than to repeat meaningless apologies over and over...
then what are we waiting for? let's go.
i've been studying medicine ever since i was a child. i want to do my part to eradicate these monsters and use what i've learned to heal others.
if he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. he'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what i mean.
yeah, i've not only learned swordplay from masters, but i've also met a bunch of people and gained a lot of insights from my experiences.
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise...
my right hand? here you go. why is this part of the-- hey, hey! ow, ow, ow!
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
i don't care who you are -- disappear right now and let me pass. and don't you ever pretend to be one of my friends again.
of course, that can't be undone now. it's too late, and i have no intention of reinventing myself all over again.
so i want to pick your brain for a bit, and see if you can come up with some new and interesting ideas.
hmm, it seems my train of thought went off the rails somewhere...
such a flagrant disregard for the "rules," and still celestia took no action... i suppose that's proof enough of the heavenly principles' situation.
okay, that's enough! in times like this, we should be trying to give each other hope!
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection... why would they come after me?
hmm? oh, i'm just a tourist. as far as i'm aware, i don't have the authority to detain anybody within sumeru's borders... is that not the case for you, too?
(the hats are definitely being used to hide a secret. but there's nothing wrong with the hats themselves...)
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
the quarterfinals are coming up. to me, this is the most important round... i'm a little nervous, but let's all do our best!
of course, that's only one example. my feelings about the heavenly principles are too complicated to explain in just a few words...
the events of five hundred years ago not only robbed me of my friend, kitsune saiguu... they also took makoto away from me for good.
no, i'm not questioning your abilities. it's just that, i've never really seen you use a kamera before.
by the way... remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
with your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
there's also a letter here. was i planning to send it to someone? let's see who the recipient is...
unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme... she was completely lost in the memory zone.
are you okay?
okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
unless i was already in a weakened state when i created this fire seed...
*cough* ahem, is that so? well, no wonder. this issue has reached the realm of the gods, after all. still, their spirit is praiseworthy.
why don't we flip the question and start by asking who couldn't be the murderer? after all, there are only three suspects, so elimination could be a valid method.
...this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
uhm... don't, you're freaking me out...
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
i'll stay outside and provide what stability i can. i'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
i am no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis. in which case, there is no further need to keep the nation under lock and key.
then... we'll keep it for now...
oh? that is important.
not quite yet. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
i just did what i had to do. you are special, after all... so special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
*sigh* you're too cautious. a gift is a gift -- it's rude not to take it!
there's no time. i'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the memory zone.
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
this area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. i guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
three!? isn't that when most kids are still struggling to hold a fork?
all of you, stay focused. i'm right behind you.
do you think there are any differences between your present self and your previous and future incarnations? if not, then what are the differences between humans and puppets?
the fatui under the doctor sure didn't hold back -- they provided a lot of technological support.
i'm still worried about the owner. let's go check on her.
she left us a letter. hmm... could this be one of those "open-in-case-of-emergency" letters? i've never gotten one of those before. should we wait until we run into something dangerous?
...what's going on!? the lights have all turned on. so creepy...
no, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. in the meantime, i'm sending someone i trust to go with you.
i know it's not her first rodeo, but the thought of her taking on those horrid monsters... i can't help but worry.
well, i've been thinking that if i can't directly possess the leaders, and if i can't get ordinary people involved...
...and it's time i came to terms with it all.
executed...? we barely did anything!
but i ended up losing it before i even finished registration at the akademiya...
so many thoughts were racing through my head as i was brewing it, i... i'm not sure how to explain it...
i'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
...i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
eternity... eternity is the only way...
would you be willing to join me? c'mon, take a break from adventuring to listen to a story.
or, to save you the trouble, i can have someone from tenshukaku deliver it directly. but of course, your name will have to be written as the sender.
wait for my word. ta-ta!
yeah, yeah. well, pack your souvenirs and stuff. back home we go!
(lynette was in the magic box onstage the entire time. did she have something to do with this?)
okay, layla, calm down and think... if the seelie is a person, then there has to be a way to track them down.
really, paimon. it's not like you don't know me. do i look like i know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
maybe... but in all likelihood, that is indeed how things will end.
this time, we're not being forced or enticed, or chasing after wanted criminals. and we didn't have to sneak in through the cargo dock. this trip has been incredibly smooth...
that's quite a stash! not sure if it's enough...
(phew... perfect timing. the situation was really starting to get desperate... and not just because of the prison thing...)
finding three specific butterflies in a place as large as sumeru city sounds rather improbable...
what did he say? that i'm good at solving people's problems?
hmm... i'm really interested to check out this troupe's performance, but it really sounds like the edo star is in a lot of trouble. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
thank you for your comforting words. but this is my basic duty as inazuma's archon, and i have neglected it for far too long.
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
of course not! we scared him off.
i've got a few patients who've started refusing treatment since joining the society... it certainly makes you wonder.
serval, pela! has it really been that long!?
yes, he did. considering what we know now, it's almost certain that sinthe is created using water from the primordial sea.
if you don't take the payment now, i'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the arataki gang.
i... i'm satisfied...
allow me to decline.
to prepare, let's go check out some of her favorite spots, and have a quick chat with a few of the vendors there.
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
so, do let me know when you have more stories to share. i'm sure the kids will love them.
haha, alright, we get it. well, i suppose one of us might have gotten too engrossed in our chat and eaten them by mistake! no big deal.
we can get in now, right? hehe, svarog's certification system is no match for us!
holy moly, it's the grand prize... today must be your lucky day!
ah! i--i mean... not that madam yukong doesn't have her merits, hehe...
still, can't hurt to try your luck. and maybe you can help me get rid of the invaders while we're at it.
...yes, i plead guilty.
huh, i see... so you want to consult the oracle of the goddess of prophecy.
let me take a look. maybe there's something in here from after she was kidnapped...
so they just jumped inside that tv...
what? is that someone you know?
i was confident that i knew of all the creatures in teyvat. even if there are ones i've never seen with my own eyes, i thought i possessed all the relevant knowledge about them.
you're the one who needs to leave. i'm not letting this go.
mm-hmm. catching up with an old friend i hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.
not bad! next time, you cook the food and i'll plate it. then, it'll look as good as it tastes.
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
he was already getting ready to leave by the time i arrived. he just wanted to ask someone about the quickest way to get back to fontaine.
i suppose we can slow down for now then...
those spaces remind me of... dreams. like the one i had in the avidya forest, except these have no sign of human presence.
unfortunately, this name seems to have been wiped from existence. it doesn't seem to have a match anywhere.
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
...the dream will respond in kind, and the server really will bring you gold and mora.
then how should i rest? i definitely won't be able to sleep... as soon as i close my eyes, all kinds of thoughts start floating into my head.
i'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. i, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. i'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
but since he entrusted his will to you, clorinde, you should tell us the truth about his sacrifice.
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
that's why, no matter how tiring or how hard it gets, i won't let my family down. they are already an important part of me.
gosh, the atmosphere here is so creepy and unsettling...
mmm... you're right. i need to keep a level head -- i don't have time to waste.
what do you think? it's the perfect plan~
making sure everyone gets three macarons, of course!
oh, you're right! i almost got all excited for nothing.
mm, everyone's working hard for the bigger picture...
of course, that's not the only reason for me to go back to the surface... i can't wait to visit my parents again, and i can tell from my mom's letter that they feel the same.
there will be many people gathering here shortly, so please do your best to maintain order.
by "salvage," i mean to slowly get close to those memories, and then exert my memokeeper power to retrieve them.
(as i've told you before, there are still some mysteries for him to resolve. things that are clear as day to me, but that he has yet to understand.)
it was thanks to her that we were able to turn the tide, i wanted to thank her... i mean, there's also no point in being awkward all the time... so, we took the chance to reconcile with each other.
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
yes, it's very possible that she sacrificed her life in the fight against forbidden knowledge.
since you've made it yourself, i guess having a little taste is the least i can do, haha...
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
it's not so much that you can't feel, but that you would never express anything.
let's try using the elemental monuments in the area.
even when we're not looking up at the stars, they're always there, watching over us.
eh, there's no need for all that. let's decide on a design right now!
i'm so grateful that miss navia was so understanding. to be perfectly honest, i didn't know if i was ready to meet her.
dead-end here too... given the layout of the room, are they really suggesting we maneuver around using the walls?
even though she will one day... seize your vision, too?
you're right, though, that this may not accurately represent the image of her in our hearts. let's try to come up with something else.
makoto's gaze was always fixed on the people of inazuma. i always assumed it was because... that was her duty.
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time... train or no train.
the script was good, but i've got to say, your childhood stories were even better!
but the collective dream in sumeru city was created by the akasha, and now the akasha has been turned off.
in other words, if you weren't here, i may as well not exist. that's why you two have been everything to me. get it?
off we go then... let's take a look up there.
sure! let's find out which one of us can come up with the better strategy.
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
*sigh* alright, you two, that's enough...
ah, my little friends, there you are.
but growth is a process and shouldn't be rushed. i will always believe in and support her.
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact...
so, our first priority should be investigating and putting a stop to the sages' activities. as for how we should pull that off, let's discuss it somewhere else. there are too many adventurers around here.
oh, the blizzard immunity. shall we drink it? it's your call.
indulge my curiosity. what is the reason that i find you standing here before me once again?
alright. i... actually don't have much stamina. i've been stressed this whole time, and i feel exhausted...
i cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
and that memory... will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
i think we've found enough now, don't you?
what have you done with mister yang and miss robin?!
thanks, you two. i didn't mean to trouble you again.
no way. master yanqing has been great to me.
i heard that the miners had been having violent clashes with local thugs, with significant numbers of wounded. i hurried over to see if i could help.
however, even though svarog is no longer sealing off the furnace core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through... not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
aww, poor thing.
uh... since we're talking about him, i feel like i should add something. his martial prowess really looked... certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
"i will become the new moon, the answer to everything. then, no one will know that there were once birds, foxes, and cats in this world. and no one can know that they were different."
i'll do my best! i wanna learn all about twirly-whirly's likes and dislikes, then buy lots of snacks from the almighty merchant...
gm, permission to "investigate"!
huh... him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
i've been familiarizing myself with the angler mystery lately. -- i think it's safe to say i have the best investigative mind on the express at this point...
r--really? then... could you please help me collect the rest of the four shroom buddies i need? does this mean my luck is finally starting to change...?
are you... greater lord rukkhadevata?
wait a minute, i'm sorry, but are you... the...?
it's completely blocked by the mine cart... what do we do? can we blow it up?
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
that's about all we can do about a stellaron. it may be suppressed for now, but it's only a matter of time before it regains power.
but it's only because i'm not aiming as high... i just wanna be able to take twirly-whirly back to live with me, that's all.
rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
makes sense, but without evidence, that's still just a theory...
it is about time that i learned to trust them.
hm? i was simply telling you what i feel to be the truth. i wasn't trying to comfort you.
to avoid upsetting the peace, i told the townspeople that everyone here is a member of the theater troupe... and that you are just an actress playing the role of furina.
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
i'm joking. that tree has been through a lot since it first sprouted. we have the loving care of kitsune over the ages to thank for how it appears today.
i thought mister tail would possess me and teach me some super cool heliobus swordplay...
and whoever it is... if they can do that, who knows what else they're capable of.
mister giovanni is right! now's our chance to check out this game and see if it lives up to the hype.
i thought so too. it's most likely some rule of penacony's, or the family's.
look, up ahead on the ground... what is that?
if we keep going, we'll reach glaux avenue, which is the road to golden hour.
...really? feels like you're tricking me...
time to look at the letter. please let there be a stamp, please let there be a stamp...
for her, though... yes, probably a little too avant-garde.
wait! wasn't there some big energy hub-looking thing back in that empty area? let's go back and take a look, maybe it's linked to this gate.
she told me her price, but...
is that so... alright then, thank you so much, monsieur neuvillette. we'll take our leave now.
what about me? oh, i'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels...
you can... you can let me break the news. i should... be the one to do it.
i'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound... looked like its winged blade. we've all witnessed it in action before.
miko, retract your words.
i have chosen the latter because... if stubbornly isolating herself in the plane of euthymia is her idea of eternity...
we have always... had enough time
i mean... yeah? wanna check it out on the way?
i wanted to use this opportunity to discuss with you some things that are puzzling me right now.
...before the heavenly principles "awaken."
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
this is a human society -- at the moment, anyway -- and i'm just doing as i please.
that's a great idea. i've been underground for so long, i almost forgot what flowers smell like.
i--i'll do my best as well. at least, i don't plan to lose too badly...
(she's probably trying to tell us to speed this up. we need to hurry up so we can address the sorcerer problem...)
and the first stone slate tells us that long ago, the hydro archon used her power to turn oceanids into humans...
yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. okay?
you've been on the express for a while now, but you've never gone on a trip with himeko before, right? well, now's your chance!
i'll be here cleaning the ingredients. can you please fetch some firewood for us?
ugh, do trailblazers not understand sarcasm?
i don't have to fight all of them... right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan...
excuse me, but may i tag along?
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
wanna go fishing? i've got some rods and lures ready.
okay, let's see what there is.
hah -- do you just say yes to everything?
uh... you might have found the wrong person.
which means that if all the forbidden knowledge has been eliminated...
i see what you mean... yeah, somehow beast-tamers like him make me feel a little... sad.
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
is that hesitation that i detect in your voice? so let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, i actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
as it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. but the vagrants have their own custom: see it, share it.
it's still really hard for me to imagine, though. after all, uncle marcel has been around since i was just a child...
the antagonists? you mean all the people who behaved foolishly? what can i say, they're bad people and they all got what they deserved. end of story.
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
but i digress. if the astral express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine...
we've already experienced the sabzeruz festival many times. and... the day of the festival seems to be in a perpetual samsara.
this dream relies on a set network, which means that only those with devices planted in their bodies can enter this world.
great! fluffy pillows here we come!
absolutely. ms. petronilla and my father were good friends. back in the day, she would often bring clorinde over to play. but then...
but don't keep your fungus waiting much longer... look, now that it's no longer under the wisdom orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
oh, yes! i remember there was a florist in the overworld. how about we head over that way?
it's more or less the same as i remember before.
oh? who permitted you to come onto this stage? now, i understand your admiration for my august self, but i must ask you to keep to the rules.
all the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. i stand before it alone and unchanging.
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all... that's really weird.
take a deep breath, and visualize the dreamscape's outline in your heart. and remember... you must not open your eyes at all times.
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
"everwinter hill..." what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat...?
hahaha, i bet you guys are just too embarrassed to let loose.
when i start talking with him, listen carefully to the details of our conversation.
don't worry! i can't stand by and watch someone be bullied. i have to stand up against injustice, no matter what!
i understand... thanks, master gongshu!
come, let's pay a visit to the palais mermonia. the rest of you, head back to the rehearsal location for now, and wait for our good news.
ahhhh, which means... what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
but they appear to be getting more and more aggressive. regular stairs wouldn't try to attack us.
ugh, there's no way through here, we need to think of a way to cut her off!
looking back on it, i'm honestly embarrassed by how i acted earlier, hehe.
it's freezing... huh? master diviner, aren't you cold? i can't stop shivering.
that's right. this is how a trial goes in the opera house -- during the proceedings, the chief justice and the oratrice will hear statements from both sides.
even the people who usually criticize me voted for me this time... so i feel like i have to live up to their expectations somehow...
from this day forth, this body will remain your assistant.
now, it seems like she was right, while i took the wayward path.
haha, oh yeah? well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
had this opera house ever given my father any kind of confidence in its brand of justice, spina di rosula would have had no reason to exist!
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
i'll show you once we're back to the master control zone~
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
at least we know who to look for next. we can ask the bloodhound family for information.
alright, then let's head out!
(he had to set up so many scenes today, and now, he has to join in for this last part... i really don't envy his job.)
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
so be it. the sensation is not a disagreeable one.
she takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
...it all points to one person -- the "expert" in charge of the entire exhibition.
and if that's the case, finding the other fungi still wouldn't help us at all.
all of you, please get out of here and find somewhere safe!
mercenaries rely heavily on muscle memory, and dehya was able to use her experiences to avoid injury in later samsara cycles.
#{m#so while we used to travel from world to world, we are now trapped here.}{f#so whilst we used to cross world after world, we are now trapped here.}
...miss acheron's words speak sense. regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. and we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
ah, he used that "tuning" on us, too! does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
it's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. it was once quite popular during festivals.
no, but i understand why now. it was because the sacred sakura hadn't even been planted then.
however, i believe that if the murder case is related to those behind the disappearances, they must know something.
to the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. luckily, i'm ei's familiar, so i can sense her rough whereabouts.
we talked to people in both the overworld and underworld. the final result was... a tie.
and then... we'll let greater lord rukkhadevata tell us the truth in person.
...thank you, all of you. thank you so much.
right? i don't think it's fair for you to carry the weight alone. why not discuss it with others first?
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
in such investigations, even the smallest step can seem like a yawning chasm if the trail of clues is cut off.
n--no! the express is strong -- i'm sure we can think of something!
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
it's alright, uncle marcel. there's no need to stress.
so that's it... even the villains in opera performances rarely go that far...
even a pool of stagnant water after a torrential storm can occasionally pass as a patch of sky.
...even if the truth is that their dreams are reaped by the akasha.
i did say this is what "we're" going to do. i trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
this scene is when our two characters return home only to discover their mother has been murdered. ready? lights, kamera, action!
kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
in fontaine, i experienced how drinking primordial seawater made me more attuned to the element of hydro... but, that substance would be hard to get around here.
and miss firefly, we thank you for all your support. we're faced with a formidable enemy. as long as the astral express and stellaron hunters' objectives are aligned, we're willing to cooperate with you.
wait... it cuts off...
(it seems i've turned them around. best follow this flow and restart my accession speech...)
it feels like this echo is different from the others before.
i haven't been able to sit back once over the past ten years -- a moment's negligence could have brought wildfire crashing down... and the underworld would've been beyond saving.
yeah! fyi, we're pretty awesome.
are you going to help this... um, clockie that only you can see?
the sages convinced everyone to believe that being unable to dream is a sign of rationality and wisdom. not dreaming is a badge of honor in sumeru...
gallagher... does have a troubled past, it seems.
dim sum... is that some kind of liyue term for snacks or desserts?
ah, let me introduce you. this is colter, another of spina di rosula's members. he was found guilty and sentenced to the fortress of meropide some time ago.
uhh... i have no idea how to respond to that...
he needs you. it's essential if we want to reclaim penacony. recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, i opted to join forces with him.
let's get back to the feast and enjoy each other's company. we'll be starting the post-production process tomorrow.
well, considering your tendency to run from your problems, we did originally prepare a direct sample of the seawater around poisson.
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
that's the spirit! come on, we should take some more photos before we head back to the express.
clorinde is the one who didn't buy anything for herself.
anti-raiden shogun training. i've prepared a special program, just for you. come along now.
probably because "yesterday" just happened to end at that moment.
however, following this duel, i have decided to postpone the kujou clan's punishment for the time being.
anyway, a trial begins the moment someone levels charges. and of course, there was no way furina was going to back down in that situation.
with their propaganda in place, the sages can maximize their use of the akasha to facilitate their research.
well, i can't summon a real meteor shower, but if it's in a dream, i can help out.
everyone from spina di rosula organized a memorial for my father. we never held a memorial when he first died, since everyone knew that even if we held one back then, no one was going to come.
general, keep those eyes open, now's not the time to fall asleep!
but fortunately, he already knows us from before, so hopefully we'll be able to wake him up.
besides, after everything we've been through together, i'm sure our hearts would remain intertwined even if we found ourselves on opposite sides of the world!
the mora spent to rent out the hotel... the way the auguste flower was cultivated... the "method" used to disguise his appearance...
how can we just... forget you like this?
(lady bonajade? i think i've heard that name somewhere before... was it from silver wolf?)
we must remove all those who stand in our way.
when you came to talk with me earlier, i jumped right to explaining my position, and said some strongly worded things.
ah no, that makes me sound suspicious... hold on, do i really look that shady?
at the end of my journey, i arrived at a place known as "the sea of flowers at the end."
sure enough, it's here, and in a really obvious place. that pretty much confirms my hunch about the seelie's intentions.
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person...
that said, if you continue down this path and find that it leads somewhere quite different from what you had hoped... what will become of that iron-clad determination then? i look forward to finding out.
so i asked the balladeer to search in irminsul for any information about the descenders. he's more familiar with this kind of information, and should be able to find it more quickly.
just open your eyes! surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? we've had nothing but critical acclaim!
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath... "exchange with your precious things."
now that i think about it, wasn't "illusions" a hint that we're all dreaming?
brrrr... it's freezing! and this place feels different somehow...
but the truth of it, marcel, is that you've always been vacher!
disconnecting from that thing so suddenly has left me feeling slightly disoriented.
phew...i nearly suffocated! what kind of plot device was that...
before one makes a plan, what is the most important thing one must do?
although people may initially feel a little uncomfortable with the loss of the akasha, they will soon understand that this life is more suitable for them.
huh!? hehe... i--i've never done it before! dan heng, you do it!
what's happening right now seems to have happened before. this feeling has been getting stronger and stronger...
ahem! are you headed off to some interesting place without telling me again?
when there are no acting gigs, i work as a guide near glaux avenue. if you don't mind, i can show you all the exciting things around here! maybe if i do my job as a guide, people will stop suspecting me...
huh? looks like numby's in a good mood.
i'm seriously scared they might start moving... let's just leave, please!
brother... where are you? what happened...?
...i still haven't worked out how to convey it to you, the issues surrounding vache. my relationship with him... the things he's done in the underworld... it's a long story.
come on, let's go back to the administrative district and hang out for a bit longer!
if you can get the raiden shogun to "open her heart" to you once more before the statue of the omnipresent god, you will have the opportunity you need...
hehe, thanks pela -- we'll do our best!
hmm? wait a moment, child. you're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
sir, we were indeed in the city earlier, but our purpose was only to gather information on the monsters. we're here to help this city and all the people within it.
and aren't human emotions -- love, hate, regret, and hope -- just the most mesmerizing things in this world?
what are you afraid of? surely you don't think that aurelie's story is unworthy of the grandest stage in fontaine?
we've arrived! from here we need to take a starskiff to the cloudford victory zone.
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality... all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
hehe, is that so? how interesting. let's hear your reasoning, then.
yeah, belobog is a kind of snowy doomsday city... there are heaters like this all over the place, otherwise people wouldn't survive.
if the... oceanid you met is one of the young women who went missing recently, we should be able to find some related information there.
yeah, we'd never team up with someone like him!
everyone on the street who happened to be close to the water didn't have a chance to escape. as the water levels rose, they suddenly disappeared. they were all dissolved...
i guess only those who have thoroughly accepted this dream will be able to come here.
i was shy! talking about personal stuff like that in front of everyone... it'd be too embarrassing!
don't worry, it should be easy enough for you to keep that mind of yours clear, paimon. let's go.
haha... hahahaha! so you've been watching me all this time, have you? i didn't think you were that type!
i warned the patients countless times, but it seems like they had their heads in the sand all along... no wonder they kept the mutual aid society a secret from me.
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
what about you? are you all done already?
no, i'll explain it myself. i suppose i couldn't run from this topic forever, and as partners, this is something i hope they can understand.
then come aboard and take a look for yourself.
i say "gift," but it's more like bits and pieces the kids cobbled together. still, i hope you like it.
it's an insult to the very concept of life.
but once everyone believes the illusion, can't magic reveal the truth to them once again?
...yeah. so what?
alright, then! look after the city for me while i'm gone.
from what i've heard, the rights of all the other members of the spina only went as far as giving him advice or suggestions, and no further. that included my mother, too.
it's ironic to think that in my whole time as a "god," i could only ever dream of receiving this kind of power...
although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. to me, this says you like to take care of it.
...wait, are you for real?
every trial you've ever judged has left its impression on you. and that's what makes you who you are today.
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
if we'd had the chance to examine this notebook carefully back then, it would have been a conclusive piece of evidence, proving vacher's guilt.
tell me. aren't you and lynette actually from the house of the hearth?
what? so is every person in teyvat who doesn't want money gathered here to shoot this film? don't tell me chiori isn't being paid either...
things i want to do? let's see, where to start...
get it together, layla... you're doing well so far, but you've still got a lot to learn.
this is what trailblazing is.
you should join us, chevreuse. you missed the first few hours of the party, didn't you?
i guess that's possible, he could be a masked fool after all...
to me, it's because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
hey, you're finally back!
awesome! i knew you wouldn't abandon such a cute and defenseless creature!
is that so... well, i respect your choice.
here is the pass permit. show it to the okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
i suppose it's fair to say, then, that this final show, besides being your farewell to the stage, is also your final gift for her?
i knew his research in the overworld wasn't going well. i used to write to him and ask him to come down and stay with the kids in the orphanage for a while. i thought it might help take his mind off his research.
hah, you're facing a veteran marechaussee hunter. you don't stand a chance!
i guess we should get going again. will you come with us, monsieur neuvillette?
king deshret... that god who died even longer ago? some present-day desert-dwellers still worship him. you probably just heard some of their conspiracies.
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know...
without your help, there would have been many more casualties... i won't forget your kindness.
(if you mean the mysterious events, the kabukimono, and so on... yes, i know about all of that.)
think before opening your mouth!
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
but this electro gnosis is the prize i obtained after defeating one of your fellow harbingers.
this is a memory fortune pouch i prepared for the express crew. my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
but i'm running out of time... oh, what should i do...?
right! you finally get what we're all about. pretty cool, huh?
what!? this fella's already broken... what should we do, take it with us?
are there... not enough soldiers to drive them out?
before our next expedition, i need himeko to teach me some negotiation skills. beating people up all the time is cramping my elegance!
you and all our other comrades at the spina deserve to know the truth as well.
maybe it noticed me on my way back and thought i'd be able to help.
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
thank you so much. since you're willing to help, i have something i'd like to show you.
meanwhile, everyone else has no idea that they are in a sabzeruz festival samsara while their dreams are stolen from them over and over again.
this again... no wait, could it be...
this power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
melus, what was the key evidence that he shared with you?
indeed... and it all happened under my nose. how ridiculous -- my judgment was clouded by trust in a loved one...
well, i don't really need anything! just don't be a stranger, alright?
but i didn't feel like he was lying when he was talking to us about the meka. i also don't think he'd be able to keep that kind of tampering under wraps.
...i've gotta say, this puzzle is pretty unorthodox...
i was wondering about that too... what happened back there, exactly?
(lyney went to the room that contains the oratrice's core. this is the actual truth.)
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
i'm fine... sorry, i hope i haven't scared you.
but you never mentioned this to me...
let's go. half the journey is still ahead of us.
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
it seems my strategy was more effective this time.
what? you're still not ready to go?
(the mechanic removed the withered heart from the device as he spoke.)
perhaps it was a prop for a different trick? but why would it have been left here?
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
hehe, what an adorable little girl. well, that settles it. aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
in truth, i know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
miss tingyun couldn't tear herself away from work, so we've had to gift this on her behalf today.
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya...
so, it's not that the watchmaker's dream bubble is empty, but rather... the stuff inside ran away?
let's have some fun with our fungi friends, then take a break to sample some of sumeru's delectable snacks.
i know you have many misgivings about him, but as someone who had "become a god," he has retained a number of very useful features.
however, we should revisit the case now that we've gained new information about the abilities of water from the primordial sea.
er... have you ever heard of the marechaussee hunters?
the closest piece of info i have is that my father had been investigating the serial disappearances case at the time of his death.
don't worry, seele. like i said, it was just the exhaustion. svarog was deliberately holding back.
once both sides have finished speaking, the chief justice will make his final decision. this, too, will be used by the oratrice as a reference.
that's the most important outcome of this trip. to be honest, i wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when i lent you the pass permit.
you have returned... but how were you able to get back in? and... how come you have not changed at all in all these years...
no, i already have enough information on setaria. the most important thing now is for you to pay attention to the vendor's talking style and key characteristics.
thanks, miss asta. but i... i'm not sure i should...
although the bloodhounds mistook me for a stowaway, i'm actually a local. my name is firefly, and i'm from the iris family. i work as a stage performer, although right now i'm just an extra...
i had some spare time, so i decided to come out for a stroll. oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
am i right, mister lyney?
it seems like someone has been awaiting us. ready to step into the spotlight now?
garden of recollection... is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
that's good. i hope it's a little more satisfied with the way i am now, hehe.
it's not only the monsters that i am worried about. i'm concerned about what else might escape from the sacred sakura.
i knew we could rely on you!
it's a little bit forced, but it's fine. so... who is this mister sampo, then?
hey, that's pretty good! i'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
no, yoimiya! you have to stay here.
i never expected the corporation to know anything about aether copying tech! i thought that was something only punklordian hackers could handle.
um... haha, you're right, himeko.
your story is one that has captivated me. i really do have high hopes for you... please do your best to live up to them, child.
the problem is... i'm also planning to visit the almighty merchant at seven in the morning tomorrow to buy all the ingredients i need...
aren't there... other crew members we can take inspiration from?
didn't i make myself clear at the time? the decisions of the gods are naturally difficult for humans to comprehend. there is no need to provide an explanation...
pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
(i've conducted so many investigations across the centuries, but there's not even a sliver of hope that we might break the prophecy...)
well try this on for size -- nope! i can't stand anymore of this fighting, so there!
but i've made up my mind. so i will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
and, as a memokeeper, i also have to fulfill my responsibilities and harvest some interesting memories.
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh... inconvenient situation.
yes. though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the ley lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
i remember giving you junjun. i haven't seen this fella in years. where did you find him?
the way it looks to me is that shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. would you mind telling me what that's all about?
general, are you... okay?
of course not. the memokeepers' divination techniques don't all involve memories.
don't worry, mister oleg, we'll make sure you don't regret it!
it was both dream and reality.
just you wait and see! i'll show off my skills in the ring and win a match. i'll make both of you proud!
the theory sections are pretty much finished. i'll be able to finish organizing the rest on my own.
hah. do not jest. can you not feel it?
plus, this is the family's turf. teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
...i really hope it doesn't mean that.
um, do you mind if i come in from the chimney, just to take a look?
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
whew... but now, it is time for the hydro archon to show you her courage and resolve!
wait, don't tell me paimon never...! ah, this is all my fault. it's not too late to cover your ears! here, paimon, i'll do it for you!
i think they're deliberately trying to hide something.
i think it's rather good. a lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. from ordinary soldier to great leader -- a fresh take on a timeless classic.
foolish question. there are only two kinds of foods -- those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.
by the way, there's really no point in trying to hide the way you feel.
i understand your anger, but as your doctor, i ask you to trust my judgment.
the sages are creating a god to replace me...
it's a very cute room, miss march... just like you.
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
*sigh* i knew this wouldn't be simple...
and if you were to stop drinking it completely... you'll experience flashes of paranoia and anxiety, while lacking energy to do anything. it's an extremely dangerous substance.
how could he protect his honor if he's dead? if anything he gave up his chance to defend himself.
kujou kamaji is wounded. descendants of the takatsukasa clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
i'm going to try my luck in the city, too.
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
i mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. you don't need to look after me...
that's enough chatter. get to work!
if you're not sure what to do next, how about i take you on a walk?
how's it going, my little layla? have you been teaching your opponents a lesson?
besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
keep going straight down this alley and it'll lead to an elevator. it'll take us to the center of the land of the exiles.
that's right, and you're the sidekick!
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends... even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
...does "miss sparkle's body" even count as a real character?
(so interminable... so lonely... just how much longer...)
the man's name was jacques. he felt greatly ashamed about his work after seeing many families destroyed by sinthe abuse.
it's getting weak! quick, finish it off!
this is exactly what we need to investigate. anyway, let's pay another visit to "a moment of dreams."
n--no, that's not what i meant...
then the ipc isn't your family! stop lying to yourself.
phones and cameras capture great beauty, but it never compares to what we see with our own eyes.
okay. i understand now, thank you.
hang on, a precious heirloom passed down to you by your master, and you gave it to me just like that? you weren't worried i might lose it?
this is your plane of euthymia. it's your inner world.
besides, ordinary computers don't have cool backstories. technology handed down from nous, huh...
alright, last question... who am i?
you've also had conversations with the opera house's operating staff, right? didn't they want to increase the number of showings?
we're in the middle of a take! couldn't you wait until we wrapped up this scene!?
this time, though, everyone in poisson and even many people from the court all attended.
to be honest, our financial situation was a lot better back when my father was in charge a few years ago. i'm afraid i'm not quite his equal...
in other words, you believe that he knew nothing of the incident?
a planet covered in snow and ice... will i find my answer here...?
ah, i see... i knew you couldn't have come all this way just to amuse yourselves at my expense.
...like countless fireflies chasing the fire.
hmm... you know, it could be because... you attract more attention than you think.
all letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? as long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded...
ha. ha. you're a regular comedian...
well, what do you think? got any ideas?
the color of the sky... coincides with the moment in time she described.
must we, really? i should think that of anyone, your friend lyney already knows this truth very well...
remember when we entered the hotel in the dreamscape for the first time, and i procured a few trinkets from your companions? their functions are similar.
ah, you mean that naughty kid we played hide-and-seek with?
that settles it then. thanks for sticking by me throughout all this...
maybe that's why the trailblaze chose such a look.
um, did i say something wrong just now?
so you're not the guide mister oleg was talking about, seele?
i'm sorry, you're right. it's a bad habit of mine.
at first, i just felt bad about rejecting them, so i wanted to learn a little bit more about their situation. but one thing led to another, and... well, here we are.
humble again as always, i see, even when i was totally sincere with my praise.
anyway, florent, now it's up to us to confirm the final design, right?
not always, sometimes it's a happier conclusion.
but when there are valid grounds, i will not only judge travelers from abroad...
okay, i should get started on those notes. if there's anything you're curious about, you may go ahead and ask now. i can answer you as i write! i'm used to multi-tasking.
anyway, you should watch and learn, because i plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that divine priestess from watatsumi island.
this is the largest park in golden hour -- it represents the soda culture of penacony. that gigantic soda bottle houses the headquarters of the soulglad enterprise!
...it's not like that. you're making this too complicated...
*sigh* if only he'd been more open with me when he was still alive.
one thing though -- we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
he brought comfort to the people of this world... even though he was denied the very right to be a part of it...
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
please have some tea, masters!
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
even though i still have a lot of questions, this experience was fruitful enough.
i'm sorry, everyone. i was unable to protect the people of poisson... it is my duty to stand trial for my crimes.
i... of course not...
anyway, let's head out. i'll arrange for a boat to take us back to poisson. i'm sure adele will be happy to see you two again.
too chicken? i was giving you the chance to back out! but you're actually insulting me now, you cheeky...
adele, we're back! we brought you a gift from the court, too.
hehehe... okay, i'll stop. now, a question for you. traveler, what is your ambition?
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work...)
what was meant to happen did happen after all. everyone's dead...
but that would mean the effects of forbidden knowledge could've...
i've lost count of all the dolls i've made. to be honest, i wasn't expecting her to like this one so much.
huh? i was just kidding... please don't take me seriously.
this i really wasn't expecting...
what are you up to, sampo? why do you insist on getting caught up in overworld affairs that have nothing to do with you? if it's a whole lot more attention from wildfire you want, you're going about it the right way.
don't worry, at least we've figured out who's behind all this. let's just play it by ear. if you're scared, paimon, just hold my hand.
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
vache... out of everyone in my family, i think he probably appreciated flowers the least.
y'know, the underground has been cut off from the surface for years. for you outsiders to descend on us out of nowhere is pretty incredible.
now... we should have a way of dealing with those baddies.
much as i expected. the insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists... you seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
repeat after me. "three, two, one, one, two, three, ahhhh, ahhhh." come on.
exactly! he just wants to show off, which is why he picked aurum alley as the venue.
(now it seems like the hook rope was not meant for another magic trick, but was instead some form of triggering mechanism.)
oh please, it's the result that counts~ gotta take risks sometimes if you wanna succeed~
what a pleasant surprise, truly an extra slice of joy.
that complicates things... maybe the only way left is forward.
it's all thanks to clorinde's quick thinking!
...and to realize that i should really take you up on your offer, and make sure i get a good rest for once!
oh... yep!
"because i am an older sister to them."
ah, right. i knew about that even when she was still my subordinate.
what do you mean? are you not coming with us...?
ahahaha... well, at least let us help clean up.
that's right. and she must have been terrified to see her father not in his right mind.
hmph, you do it next time -- i'm tired of being the villain.
if only himeko could come with us...
right. that's how things are now... the living are so exhausted that they've no strength to spare any words for the dead.
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past...
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
i don't really think bad students would come to the house of daena to pass the time... but anyways, you were saying?
this is a small ball of light that it left behind...
as such, we're still partners. there's no need to thank me.
i don't wanna get to the end so soon... i want my journey to go on forever.
here we go.... let's save the victory speeches for later.
when his experiments were exposed, i spent a long time with oleg discussing how to handle the aftermath.
but the oratrice handed out that verdict unilaterally, and it has been operating independently ever since it was first created.
i think it'd be better if the ipc avoided it... it sounds pretty dangerous.
thank you for understanding. i'll return it in perfect working order once i'm finished with it.
i'm not asking about that! although, you're not wrong...
i don't know what grudges they have... but this path is a dead end, too.
huh? like... now? is this really the right time...?
it seems like i won't need you to answer my last question.
such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of eternity. i'm afraid i'll have to consider it further.
let me see... it should be here, i think?
yeah... feels like we're missing something...
so that's why you were so silent! hmph, if you wanna be as awesome as us, you better start training every day~
trying to find a way to save irminsul is my life's mission and top priority. i will work on that, and try to live up to being a deity in the meantime...
a person is defined by their actions alone... i think that's how the saying goes? if the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
t--the oratrice? it... it's just like it appears to be...
oh, we should probably give these props back, right? i'll just leave mine here.
hehe, that's very kind of you. don't you underestimate the leader of wildfire.
if you're interested, i'd be quite happy to do a reading for you two.
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie...
speaking of the story... why is the beginning scene on a beach?
hmm, alright. it seems that your crew really can't go on without my care and direction.
not all eagles who have fallen to the ground can soar in the sky once again. but if no risks are taken, then the eagle will be grounded forever.
i get it. from how you described her, i can see that she is a kind and caring soul...
you're layla's friend, right? and from the looks of things, the two of you are preparing for her thesis defense?
the moment you came into this dream, it created a "haydar" to realize your wish of reuniting with your family.
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do...
himeko and mister yang and... who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
i dunno... but how did it know about all these details? i've hardly told anyone about this stuff...
you intend to stop her achieving victory? i can't say i didn't expect that response from you. but i hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament... are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
that's when i figured out that you might be in danger, and hurried here as quickly as i could.
oh yeah? well, since you think it's so easy, you can sign them for me.
for example, i can foresee the outside world posing a threat to inazuma's businesses. these are the issues that i must work to solve.
i'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the memory zone.
relax, we got this. right, dan heng?
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
haha, i was ready ages ago. *sigh* i've been here so many times before, it should've been just an ordinary trip for me.
whew... not bad. how many of these big guys is svarog hiding?
uh oh... which one was the original door?
there's also a "dream's eye" left here by a dreamweaver... we're running out of time, we'll have to use it if necessary.
i came up with a set of prediction methods that encompass more than half of the triple-orbit problems. however, there are quite a few limitations and requirements.
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
aventurine is telling the truth. this "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
i--is he still standing? goodness, he sure has a lot of hp...
...such a huge area.
in short, if everything goes according to plan, they may yet prove to be helpful.
theoretically, i can enter anyone's mind as long as they're wearing their akasha terminal.
(the flower vase was not broken to cover anything up, but was smashed during the struggle between liliane and cowell...)
still, who knows. he must be more experienced than me -- maybe he's just better at dealing with it all than i am.
regardless of whether their hatred and anger towards me or the spina was justified, anyone who's willing to endanger innocent civilians is no longer sane enough to even be worth trying to talk to.
as the countdown began, he entered the tunnel.
this place feels kinda... yeah, a lot like where i live. cozy and familiar.
with her long-term sleep deprivation, whenever her anxiety peaks, she loses consciousness and i take over.
not good. try to remember. your name is...
the paper looks familiar... can i open it?
so, how'd i do, master?
haha, i don't know how much of a celebration we'll be having... but i know hook and clara will be pleased to sit with you.
alright, everyone should have gathered at "a moment of dreams" by now. let's head back.
*sigh* alright... well, keeping you around under duress would only take all the fun out of it.
i'll take this weapon... since it used to belong to este. maybe it'll find comfort in being held by someone who appreciates the arts.
hmm~ after seeing this special modification... i can't help but wonder, do all victory zones have a similar kind of setup?
ahem! miss ayaka, miss chevreuse, could the two of you please come over here?
(but if there's nothing on her head, why did avice feel the need to remove her hat?)
...seriously? thanking us like that, and then immediately sending us on another mission?
i knew i'd offended that diviner -- that's why she sent this girl to help us!
he was gentle and introverted. but when it came to work he could be absurdly obsessive... like a completely different person.
it's best to be skeptical of her. there's a significant amount of intentional misdirection in her words.
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later...
since we've embarked on two very different paths to eternity, i can either continue to maintain the status quo or do whatever it takes to bring her back on track, regardless of the cost...
since we are both here for the same reason, let us work together.
after all those millennia... is this what jarilo-vi has become?
hmm... why don't you take a guess?
it's getting worse again... but it's fine, i'm about to put an end to it all.
really? hehe, i don't know if you really mean it, but i'm happy to hear that.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land... must have been real too, right?
another wubbaboo! let's have a chat with it.
what is it? is there something on my face...?
your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. i imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
oh? by the sounds of it, you understand the current situation pretty well. so then, what about this samsara?
i think so? we ran into neuvillette on the way here as well, but he was already on his way back, so they probably weren't together.
she sounds professional enough. she is a captain, after all. i have no objections.
about that... melus told me a thing or two, so i think i can understand why he committed to the duel.
see, even clorinde was happy to take him up on his offer.
even as a hilichurl, seeing the terrible sight within the mirror wasn't enough to taint his spirit.
heh, if you thought they stood any chance against us, you were sorely mistaken.
(this is a good spot for a fire. even if the fire was to spread, it'd be easy to contain.)
there i was getting excited to tell everyone the good news...
oh, okay! i'll be looking forward to it then.
what's the meaning of life? what's the purpose of my existence? why do i keep experiencing pain and loss?
hello everyone, i'm march seventh! i'm an ordinary girl who loves adventures!
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? ...did something manage to sneak in?
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
when the twilight sword is prepared for battle, any army i could send would only be marching to their doom... better that i face you alone.
before we departed, the conductor asked us to inquire about the three nameless in penacony. we've already collect intel about razalina and tiernan, so the only one left is legwork.
all right, that's enough talk for today. if you ever miss me, just close your eyes -- and maybe i'll appear in your dreams~
the reason being that she lost to me. and when i say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. it was quite a humiliating defeat.
i just got lucky, i think...
with the mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
oh, i forgot to tell you.
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream... we can just head to the place i mentioned later...
ah!? who would do such a horrible mean thing!?
i know only the full truth could bring closure to you -- and to all of us.
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
with me here it was a walk in the park!
the answer lies with the three of you. i'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
i've got lots! it's just, i don't know what to choose.
ugh, no wonder the xianzhou is so scared of the abominations of abundance -- they're unstoppable!
deceiving the people of sumeru with no regard for their safety... no matter what they're trying to do, this is unforgivable.
ah... i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises...
indeed... i've thought about giving up so many times. especially after we almost lost poisson...
no, not those... oh, c'mon, i'm not an entomology major and even i know that fireflies aren't anything like what i'm talking about.
(oh, almost forgot about that title page... he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
it's locked. i can travel through it freely, but you all...
i'm... i'm really nervous. i've been so worried about disappointing everyone that i've been losing sleep...
oh, you mean the special patrol's musketeers?
wow, now that's what i call a pay-off.
"celebrate the birth of that god"...
a battleground... one where i shall sever ties with the past and take the first steps into the future.
i do hope you'll act prudently, and choose the simpler path of admitting guilt.
"hello, layla. it must've been quite the endeavor to follow the seelie's hints all the way here. great work."
no, i'm not getting any flashbacks. please -- do i look xianzhouish to you? you must be thinking of dan heng.
what are you talking about? are you still half-asleep or something...? the order's dream is over.
there was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than yae miko, the wise and beautiful.
i'm sure lady furina would be eager to see the ending, and would agree in order to finish watching the play, don't you think?
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
but just take a good look around you, and you'll see many other people who have had similar experiences.
defeating signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
what if... the secret's hidden inside these weapons?
of course you may, but you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
it's not that no one noticed -- it's more like no one cared. ultimately, it's all rooted in the sages' misdirection.
the protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. sounds interesting. approved!
here we are, everwinter monument! photo time!
i, a traveler who has traversed many worlds, give to you my blessing. may you find friendship and goodwill, no matter where you go.
hehe, it's funny how he tries to act all mature, but whenever it comes to something he's interested in, you can really see his childish side.
ahem! you talk too much. well, in that case, let's head back to one of our bases, shall we? i'll arrange accommodations for you.
why are you always asking so many questions? of course not. i just had to say something because i clearly wasn't convincing her.
guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
now that i think about it, perhaps i never needed to recommend that store to you in the first place.
no one knows if this could happen again. all we can do for now is try our best to help evacuate the residents. we still haven't completed the headcount, but we'll have some numbers soon.
if you could find anything that aurelie left behind... perhaps we can get a better sense of what she went through in her final days.
oh, i've heard that line so many times before!
it's just as well, really, with the amount of effort it took me to get you back here. honestly, it was like you were glued to the ground back there.
let's waste no time and head to the theme park then!
it was there that we bid each other a final farewell. i cried bitterly. even in those final moments, i couldn't understand her actions.
the real dunyarzad's consciousness could no longer keep playing her role in this dream...
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
no problem. just think of it as my greeting gift for little klee.
indeed. countless monsters suddenly appeared throughout all of inazuma. in the end... kitsune saiguu sacrificed her life to protect the people.
if poured into the flower pot, the liquid would seep into the soil... that might prevent the substance from taking effect...
the complex locality of this world has been... affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. that is how yae miko wages war!
i don't need any help here, why don't you try asking someone else?
i would like to take everyone back to three years ago, to the case of "callas the unfaithful."
(i need to think about this a bit more... just what is dougier trying to hide?)
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
(what should i say... to most appear like a god? to be honest, i still don't know. perhaps i should first try to act natural...)
oh yeah, i guess. you're pretty smart... sometimes.
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
can you please tell me what this is?
you mean how the akasha stops you from having dreams?
seems like the smoke is getting thinner...
that's it? not even a picture or any other marking to go off of... this is pretty abstract.
okay... i think i got this...
i know, right? it's a dream that's loving and forgiving to everyone, just like the family.
oh... is it not convenient for you to do that for me?
let me see... hmm, looks like she's basically gathered all the information she needs. it won't take long to wrap this up.
...i'm a kind of allergic to those types of situations. i think i'll just head back to my room and start packing.
super sorry, monsieur chief justice. i swear this really will be the last time that i'll speak out of turn.
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
is there really no other way? there must be something else i can do!
i don't know why, but a lot of people recommended me. i didn't sign up myself. i just woke up to find my name on the announcement board.
with a more powerful shogun, i will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
*sigh* so this is goodbye, huh. well, if you do encounter any other trouble in fontaine, you're always welcome to contact the spina di rosula -- i'll give your request the highest priority.
eternity is a concept intimately connected with time. when you begin to touch on eternity, the concept of time becomes murky.
...careful, there are some strange things on the wall... and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe...
himeko and mister yang are probably still busy... let's go look for dan heng first.
but, how does it know my feelings so well?
it's done! it came out great -- you're very photogenic.
that witch! she was here waiting for us the whole time. show yourself, phantylia!
veronique! can we try a different kamera?
perhaps we should just leave them be for now.
a little goes a long way.
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
and if that's the only way that i can continue to feel her love, then i'd like to pass that warmth on.
the heavenly principles... irrelevant nonsense as far as i am concerned.
that fool, couldn't he have just given it to me straight...
oh, please, you needn't worry. you've just been asleep for a while, i barely had to lift a finger.
mm... that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
i see -- thank you for your keen insight. then let's pretend we were misled by a red herring. hmm... this doll... could it be connected to the case?
he cut you off completely! this guy...
excuse me, have you ever heard of the wisdom seelie?
huh? something feels different about this place?
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
my, someone rather discerning fitted out this shrine.
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
yes. back then, her family was overly protective of her. no one cared about her personality or thoughts. it was as if she only lived to stall her eleazar.
no, there is one ray of hope, one place in fontaine that they would find almost impossible to threaten, no matter how much they wanted to.
most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines... their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
hehe... *pretend yawn* anyone else sleepy...?
i'll leave the rainforest to the aranara, and as for the city... there are a few nice kids that should be willing to help.
huh? what have we got down here... a kind of mechanism connected to the door? it looks like we might have to arrange it into a certain pattern...
s--sorry, master diviner!
so the three of them teamed up to kill her?
hey, march. that's a big smile on your face -- what's the good news?
i've thought about this too, and the answer is actually pretty simple -- he felt there were things that were more important to him.
