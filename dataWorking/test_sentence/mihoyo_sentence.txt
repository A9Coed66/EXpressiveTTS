...i just have a feeling.
the world remains constant over the centuries. but human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. transitory.
sure enough, no one knows about miss robin. i'm not surprised.
how's the journey been? if there's something weighing you down, let me do a little divination for you...
oh? you look fine to me. sorry, i need to prioritize the wounded. there have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days -- many people are injured.
...but even so, a quote i read back in school came to me just now: "those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
anyway, what's most important is that we've wrapped the film. i'm pretty confident that we'll take first prize!
i tried to understand what i had been doing when i'm unconscious, but i've never been able to get any definitive evidence.
oh, by the way -- since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
alright, take him to get some rest. he's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
i wonder if people will talk about me and twirly-whirly? if only i could use this experience in one of my papers somehow...
haha, i see you're already a full-fledged trailblazer. you're right, we can't remain indifferent to those in crisis.
okay. well, see you soon, then.
hey, when have i ever treated you poorly?
me? i didn't do anything, seriously.
now, time for a change of pace. where should we go?
i'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. i, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. i'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
so, the final conclusion is...
i'm sorry. for certain reasons, there are things i can't reveal to you yet. but there are also things you should know.
bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. you should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.
card games these days are rather ingenious.
this is a human society -- at the moment, anyway -- and i'm just doing as i please.
(so tired... so sleepy... i just wanna eat up and get to bed...)
*sigh* there are many types of friend... she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
you see, layla doesn't have many friends at the akademiya. if the others noticed her helping them out, i thought maybe i'd help her become more sociable.
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
sorry, i haven't a clue. i am also unfamiliar with the god you describe.
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
*sigh* how do you crash into someone in space...
if i make an exception to the rule now, i'm just leaving a backdoor for myself. which would be the same as not having a boundary in the first place.
plus that's where we parked the astral express! don't you worry, we'll protect you from the monsters and clear up this mess.
mhm-mmm, if it's on my tea table, it must be of the highest quality. ah, yes, and we must thank the knave for bringing these over as well.
alright, now that we're all here, let me help set the scene for everyone...
are you sure that's alright?
huh? who's that? who's calling me? where are you?
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
it's so quiet... someone say something.
thanks to you, the route to the overworld through the furnace core has reopened. i'd like to use it to return to the surface and see if i can get some help.
me? i'd suggest you go yourself. even if you don't want any more dealings with her, it's best to say that to her in person... reading this message, it seems like she may really need your help.
with their stronghold exposed, i doubt the balladeer is stubborn enough to try and retaliate now on his colleagues' behalf. it would be more trouble than it's worth.
...huh? wait! are you serious, general?
foolish question. there are only two kinds of foods -- those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.
it's just, people in the underworld still need a doctor...
miss tingyun must have left us these clues, right?
huh, what's that? a fungus with a long beard? there's no such thing... though if there were, i'd love to give it a pat or two.
centuries of pretending to be a different person changes you completely. i'm not the same person i once was.
yeah, i'm pretty confident too.
is... is that how humans feel about it as well?
at least the choice is in my hands.
wow, you really got under skott's skin with just a few words.
goodness. are people in liyue really so complex these days?
(d--do i really have what it takes to represent the rtawahist darshan?)
get it together, layla... you're doing well so far, but you've still got a lot to learn.
so you kids think you're better than us, huh? just you wait and see!
"seems like you haven't forgotten about your very first failure."
stellarons bring about different disasters on different worlds. but every world seeded with a stellaron will give birth to fragmentums.
then why didn't you reply? bronya's a good friend of ours!
right! why waste your time?
eternity means never having to let go of what you already have. but on the other hand, it also means giving up on all other possibilities. that's just the way of the world... no one can have everything.
hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. you can most definitely afford it... they're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. you have quite the generous payment due.
yeah! makes sense to me.
"the person present who shouldn't be..." who could that be?
here's my little partner in crime. souka named it "blitzara" -- i think it's rather good. very distinctive.
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory...
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
the trust that these four fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the wisdom orb.
let's head over. oh, by the way...
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
on some level, his reagents were able to alleviate the patients' suffering... but nothing more. they would forget their pain for a while, and neglect their regular treatment plans...
no stress, nat. just tell us what you really think.
my first thought was, "has a great disaster befallen inazuma?"
oh yeah, i guess. you're pretty smart... sometimes.
but in this supposed "bliss", people won't have defeated their demons. the chance to overcome their tribulations would be forever lost to them. in other words... it is an escape.
"i've placed the third hint at a crossroad without a cross. you can turn left or right, but turning back shouldn't be an option."
gallagher... gallagher... where could he be?
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason...
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
mmm... you're right. i need to keep a level head -- i don't have time to waste.
here, it's over here! whew, good thing it's dry. i was worried the message might be wet.
but it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the inazuma of today is no longer inazuma.
i'll go play with gorou, instead. it's been a while since i've seen those fuzzy ears of his.
that's why i want to rehearse and practice presenting my points in front of someone.
yes. i don't know whether it was the sages or lesser lord kusanali who came up with the idea.
they were different from most... but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
got any more encouraging words?
of course, that's not the only reason for me to go back to the surface... i can't wait to visit my parents again, and i can tell from my mom's letter that they feel the same.
rushed into it without thinking... hehe, well put. ah, she acts like such a child sometimes.
p--please... don't move...
sightseeing... hmm, that does sound pretty nice. i haven't set foot outside the akademiya in quite a while.
...so she's your sister. the landau family is full of talented young people i see.
look, diting found a strange chest... and there's a hand print on it...!
whenever i see the grand theater, i just can't stop all these thoughts from flooding my head...
that's why i want you to help me recover all the wonder medicine. are you willing to take on this assignment?
your present will is not the product of erosion. i shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
mm, i don't blame you for that. a disregard for human life doesn't exactly endear you to other humans...
it's getting weak! quick, finish it off!
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
if there's anything you want to know, don't hesitate to ask.
...wow, things are getting tense!
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
and i want to live up to their expectations. i don't want them to regret putting my name down.
if a vision is a gift from the gods...
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice... could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
and more fashionably dressed, too... hey, is he about to leave? what about the girl in red?
hehehe. it's to thank you.
because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
i think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
so what does he want us to take a look at?
mister yang's instinct was right all along -- luocha is a villain! how could he do this? tearing up a book as well-written as the angler mystery... unacceptable!
the vast universe and jarilo-vi... how could you ever get tired of such an incredible view.
strange... why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something...
we both came from the overworld. maybe that's why we're so eager to turn back the clock -- to return to when life below ground was no harder than life on the surface.
hey, come now, everyone... please don't stare at me as if i was a liar...
*sigh*... you're both impossible. go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
not exactly. actually, we--
some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
the most terrible form? does that mean...?
despite all the pain and loneliness she had to endure... she never once stopped believing in the beauty in this world.
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
yes, i better think about aventurine's proposal.
...do you have the letters on you, mister oswell? let me take a look.
ugh, you two again!? we're minding our own business -- you're the ones going around stealing people's aether spirits!
n--no! the express is strong -- i'm sure we can think of something!
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already...
i didn't have high hopes, but amazingly, sampo brought me my mother's reply.
huh, i just found this in my pocket... how did it get there?
right? even if master yanqing says there's a mechanism in this sword that helps with cutting... can it really slice through a mech?
your match is over too? you took your time. i'm assuming it was a close call...
i'm pretty sure you didn't learn that one from me...
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me..."
come on. let's keep investigating the damage to the sacred sakura.
then, what of the one who crossed blades with his own sensei and beloved fellow disciple, and defeated them both? can one truly remain unagitated, of still mind, in moments such as these?
tell me this. why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? why now?
alright, i won't tease the two of you any further.
that's our bronya -- quick as a flash!
coffee... we can't really make that here...
alright, i'll give it a try. just promise not to laugh, okay?
we'll mostly be filming typical people and scenery from the streets today to improve the sense of environmental ambiance in some parts of the film.
don't be afraid. the one who has come to greet us... has arrived.
i've managed to secure more than a few urgent medical supplies through him, and he's been a big help to wildfire... in any case, i don't think his intentions are sinister.
it has been a long time. we have not seen each other since the resolution of the tenryou commission crisis.
sadly, the past has all but vanished. but seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
i'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
katou whatever-your-name-was, given the circumstances, why don't you start by going to find your brother and also picking up a handful of salt on your way. we'll need to use it during the exorcism.
alright! let's move out!
he sold his kids to chase a dream... even if he intended to go back for them, it's still insanely irresponsible.
are you ready? i have high standards, you know.
every time i'm done sorting my album and look out the window, i always want to take another picture... even though i've seen the view a thousand times, i still feel happy looking at the stars like this.
"the book is selling exceptionally well, traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. when is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
c--clara? ...you...
huh... hm...
why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
but the seelie wasn't messing with me after all.
...you can always find them.
these ambitions have transcended space and time. they are something that no one can snuff out.
can you two say anything without quarreling? this isn't the time! it sounds like there's danger waiting for us in the inner section, can we still get through?
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
i mean, it's not often we get the chance to stay there -- and i really miss their pillows!
i haven't been able to sit back once over the past ten years -- a moment's negligence could have brought wildfire crashing down... and the underworld would've been beyond saving.
i'm just saying! it'll be a shame if they get smashed to pieces.
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
yeah! of course, at times like this we're so lucky to have our crew. the family and the ipc -- everyone has their own plans going on...
why is everyone in such a hurry? i hope nothing's happened at the hotel...
but didn't you say the watchmaker betrayed the family? and you said you were his companion, so that means you...
first of all, i'm an adult. second, i didn't just break in...
your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe... and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
no, no! we've got enough on our plate.
you could capitalize on the rave reviews and license out "the little oceanid" to the bigger theater troupes out there. that would do wonders for your financial situation.
"mister skott, a great sinner of arrogance and insolence."
i feel like i'm gonna be sick...
take, par exemple, how this troupe pines for their late director... things such as this i have never witnessed before. and so, i should like to observe, perchance to understand.
alright, these should be enough.
a classic tale of youth and friendship. it never gets old.
oh... goodness, is that the time? i have another guest to receive today. we can talk more back at the grand narukami shrine.
yeah, let's not forget our bet!
...but i'm curious, why pick aurum alley of all places? it's packed with tourists around, and it'd be bad if someone got hurt.
plus, you're the only one with so many friends on the luofu. i'll be lost if you don't come along! you've got to lead the way.
the feeling of cool lake water can wash away all your troubles.
then where did it go? and why is it so quiet all of a sudden?
c'mon, miss yae... let's go help them!
ugh, what am i talking about this for? way to get everyone down, huh.
uh -- what about your mom?
...oh, i guess miss sparkle has written herself into the skit here, and this has nothing to do with the actual case. goldhammer -- is that her real surname?
but disposing of vache's reagents isn't enough to solve the medical supply shortage. many of my patients can't be seen promptly, and my stock of medicine is running low.
that should do it... okay, let's go. mister yang is waiting for us.
so... help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
what should we exchange for it?... and who should we give our stuff to?
i understand that. but if the dreams of which makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
it's okay, i'm not here to see him. we just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
right answer. now's our chance to get through to her. you, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
if she knew that there's another layla who is capable of doing everything, she may think even less of herself.
it's f--freezing here -- the blizzard's so fierce! the power from the trailblaze path isn't enough to stop the cold...
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
huh? serval, aren't you gonna look for the stellaron with us?
...yes, i plead guilty.
and of course, grilled fish is delicious, too. oh, fish skin releases oils while cooking, which drip into the fire and cause it to burn even brighter.
thank you for your comforting words. but this is my basic duty as inazuma's archon, and i have neglected it for far too long.
i have a question for you, miss chevreuse. would you be willing to play the role of a musketeer?
what vache left behind is nothing more than reagents and experimental by-products... the word "medicine" doesn't apply here.
but that's not all... my flowers are watered, laundry's done, even my broken kamera was fixed...
but it turned out you had come to rescue me... you came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
to me, it's because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
ah! looks like it's about to start. let's make our way over to the arena!
huh? peaches? i am kinda hungry...
but we don't really have any choice. this is all we've got.
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
i trust that one day, her present experiences will become unique memories.
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
pff, not yet, maybe, but... anyway! what are you even doing here? i do hope you didn't come here just to ogle at my fall from grace?
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
yes, it's right inside.
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
really? sounds a little...
oh, okay... you do your best, too.
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
we're looking for a stellaron -- it's the source of all the disasters here. if we find it, we can--
we not only need to limit the number of stars, but we may also need to consider the degree of shift when applying triple-orbit shift algorithms...
but, how does it know my feelings so well?
ooh, maybe i should commission a sequel: reborn as guuji yae. what do you think?
yeah, don't forget the squealing!
great! everyone's just as heroic as when they arrived. so, what's the master plan, general?
yeah, wherever we go, we eat, play, and have a blast!
that's because you were zonked out the whole ride. no one had the chance to tell you.
nah, i'd like to live a little longer.
mister yang! is this really the best time?
if i understood correctly, there are currently two problems in the kingdom that need solving, right?
whoa, you're amazing! can you teach me? which animals can you imitate?
does this place ring any bells, misha?
then why didn't mister callas explain himself in court? if he had testified that a person had been dissolved, he could have at least mounted a defense.
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
also, i don't consider you a loner. oh, i don't mean him, but rather behind you...
training fungi... and then domesticating them?
huh...? huh!? so, you're the real chief? wh--what about oleg?
ah, master yunli you're already here. sorry for keeping you waiting!
whether it's studying, or even just life in general... there are so many things i have yet to get the hang of.
that is of no concern. this is my recuperation state.
this tie is a piece of evidence, right?
rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. thunder is required.
obviously! how could "light cone me" be cuter than actual me?
when she puts it like that, it actually starts to make sense...
"assertive sedation techniques..." does she mean beating people up?
(maybe this is fine. i just need to keep going, and everyone will be saved...)
it eludes me, but there's a known semblance in the memory zone, mirroring the essence she radiates... what reason does she have to delve so deep into the dreamscape?
dead-end here too... given the layout of the room, are they really suggesting we maneuver around using the walls?
when you travel with mister yang, he'll give you a thesis on everything he sees -- if you have the patience to let him go on and on.
i feel something that doesn't belong here... i sense danger.
you must be tired after the walk back to shore. perhaps i should let you go first?
i... admit that you are a born leader. your perspective on humanity brims with pessimism, yet you express equal compassion for all, even when your heart pities them.
"you have inflicted your twisted lust for power upon that innocent shop owner and insulted the extraordinary art of xianzhou swordplay."
come on! don't think like that! leave the adult matters to the adults. even if you wanted to do something for the general, it's not like you can do anything.
if you fail to make a clean break with the past, the past creeps up on you...
from the day i set foot on the battlefield, i knew that my blazing wings would eventually be extinguished. all i can hope is, before i return to the earth, i'll be able to see... the brightest light in the sky.
(the angler is both a detective and a fighter!)
so, based on this reasoning, all we have to do is wait for it at the next astrological observation site.
...i'm going back to my dessert now. you all can keep discussing that on your own.
i think we've found enough now, don't you?
i know you're more sensitive to memoria, thus more easily affected by the dreamscape than others. this is also why i have to accompany you.
uh... you might have found the wrong person.
sunshines represent "warmth and love of light..." for patients on the verge of death, my dad might have been the only light to penetrate the darkness around them.
ahem... don't you guys need to hide your identities?
if he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. he'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what i mean.
wait a sec, does that mean we've reached the grand final?
i used to think just like that samurai... that i was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
(phew... alright, furina, don't think too hard about this. you need rest -- tomorrow's a new day.)
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
look... upon leaving the lobby, the structure has become chaotic. phase through that corridor, and be careful -- do not alert the meme.
yeah, yeah, thank you very much.
look, up ahead on the ground... what is that?
i mean, i guess you could be trying to pursue your definition of the avant-garde... if that's what you're doing, i suppose you do have to find yourselves a capable director...
by the way, dan heng... this time, you'll be taking a stroll with us on the luofu, right?
that's so kind of you. i mean you've already thanked us so many times.
(how did he know about the treasure?)
huh? that's sooner than i expected. is she well enough to...
i haven't seen oleg. the miners said they saw him take a group further in.
if people of the past deserved the gods' attention, then so do the people of the future.
but of course. that's why i'm here waiting for you.
...anyway, moving on.
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting...
*pant*... *pant*... ahh...
haha, that's the trailblazing life for ya.
ugh, so i'm a criminal, huh? forget sampo, wait until i get my hands on you!
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
but is this nation worth existing for eternity?
your companionship... this is one change that i shall not contest.
the footprints, which are half as big as standard, must belong to a pepeshi person.
it's alright, clara, no pressure. just tell us how you feel about it.
agh! is that a grenade? what's that on the side... huh? it's lipstick...
this lady... is really something else!
when i returned to the arena, they were already quite a distance away. it didn't feel right to run after them and ask what they were up to...
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
(who knew clorinde had such an interesting past... i never had the chance to ask her about it before.)
hehe. come, let's pay a visit to the venue in ritou together. i promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
look! there's a crowd gathering over there. is the address starting soon?
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
you two, this way. i'll try to create a stable shortcut for you.
(given his breadth of knowledge on both academic and worldly matters, there's no way he hasn't heard about what happened in fontaine...)
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control... f--from the bridge, i mean.
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents...
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
*sigh* looking back, it wasn't. he deserved much worse...
(it's been to the chatrakam cave, the avidya forest, and the waterfall south of sumeru city.)
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
no wonder aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone -- the ipc can't back him up in the dreamscape.
ooh, i would love... n--no, no need. that would be needlessly indulgent.
yeah, the sun was too strong, so i decided to take cover here for a while.
it's a relief to see you safe and sound, miss robin.
the shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. the question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
could it be... some competitors working on other films?
yes, they are. they are strong and resilient, and have much to be proud of.
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations...
this is the place that immediately came to mind when the hint mentioned a crossroad.
alright. there's little purpose in keeping anything hidden from you, anyway.
and... *sigh* let's just say there's another devastating and unforgettable failure i had.
hmm, i see. so the thunderstorm is drawing closer...
bronya! and... topaz? you're here too?
it was simply a new experience for me. one that is worth reliving.
that... doesn't even sound human.
i could've stepped in to help that family... "would it have ended differently... if i were just a little braver?"
hehehe, is that so? then i suppose i must have missed my final chance...
hmph. then i will come again once your preparation is complete. i have time.
although having said that, i have heard rumors claiming that i sleepwalk a lot. hmm...
hmm, possibly. that sounds like a natural conclusion. so, is the road of wisdom the road that leads to the akademiya then?
got it! we'll get out of your way, then. bye!
no matter what anyone says, i believe your arrival was the reward for my long vigil. thank you, trailblazer.
but if nothing else, i know that we must avoid another war at all costs. the people cannot be made to suffer like that again.
*sigh* but the beds here are so nice!
the disaster in inazuma caused me great concern. i felt that i had to step in before it was too late, otherwise it would spread to all of teyvat.
the youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
anyway, i won't take up any more of your time. you still have to record the other contestants' progress, don't you? perhaps they've had some breakthroughs while we've been chatting.
in life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
it was a long day today. all i need is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
the situation gets more interesting with each development... blitzara injured pyro-one soon after the match started, and haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
according to micah, they died long ago.
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
it's a little bit forced, but it's fine. so... who is this mister sampo, then?
the profoundest of the profound is the musou no hitotachi. a sword art without parallel in all the world. with you as my sparring partner, i can perfect that technique even further.
you think so? i thought i was rather accommodating. if it had been the shogun... she would have decapitated kujou kamaji without a second thought.
oh? you arrived a little later than expected. did you run into some trouble along the way?
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
a--are you sure this isn't the real her?
yawning without covering your mouth? uncouth. i will pardon your rudeness this time. good morning to you, too.
last time we took a walk around inazuma together, i witnessed the way the world is today. i was finally able to comprehend some things that i had never understood in the past.
okay, layla, calm down and think... if the seelie is a person, then there has to be a way to track them down.
himeko! you finally spared a thought for us!
an interesting answer. but if you ask me, i think all emotion shall ultimately return home to the heart, and slowly settle with the passage of time.
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
uh... since we're talking about him, i feel like i should add something. his martial prowess really looked... certainly pretty impressive, yeah!
haha, then there's no problem at all. you know, the traveler and i already had a duel the first time we met.
let's explore around. be careful, everyone.
unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. with his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza...
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
i warned the patients countless times, but it seems like they had their heads in the sand all along... no wonder they kept the mutual aid society a secret from me.
does this "true taste" have anything to do with that mikhail?
in other words, it's probably just conducting research, and the nature of its research is very similar to mine.
some words are not to be passed on.
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
great minds really do think alike!
it was a choice... the pursuit of arduous labor for the survival of our entire civilization.
just a strange feeling. i had it a few stops ago, but it's super strong this time.
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
as for wildfire, we need more time to build up our strength.
(right! "mirror-me" said that i just need to play the role of a god as humans imagine them to be...)
i believe this is indeed the "finale."
haha, i was ready ages ago. *sigh* i've been here so many times before, it should've been just an ordinary trip for me.
...or he wasn't telling us the truth?
uh, pitch-dark hook the great, where is the fight club? can you show us the way?
don't come close. this bomb is very dangerous! and... i'm the real firefly!
*sigh* it's been way too long since i last visited home...
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
no, no, this is completely different.
now that you've decided, i don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. i think you're making the right choice, bronya.
pajamas, hot water bottle, pom-pom doll... that should be everything! let's go!
i vow to the subjects of inazuma that i shall one day return. this is my oath. please be my witness.
i heard that the miners had been having violent clashes with local thugs, with significant numbers of wounded. i hurried over to see if i could help.
but now, i no longer cling to what was lost. i suppose that means our differences have been reconciled.
gardes, take vacher away!
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
but... what is the price to attain all this?
because we're asking nicely? what's with the attitude?
if you hear any juicy gossi-- uh... information, come find me!
himeko and mister yang are probably still busy... let's go look for dan heng first.
of course not! who would press something like that!
although the bloodhounds mistook me for a stowaway, i'm actually a local. my name is firefly, and i'm from the iris family. i work as a stage performer, although right now i'm just an extra...
she thought she had escaped but...
sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. but try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
there was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than yae miko, the wise and beautiful.
thank you for the meal. i thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
in other words, even though i can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, i can still send you to where ei is.
woah! what a big bathtub...
she sounds professional enough. she is a captain, after all. i have no objections.
no need. this is merely a memokeeper's duty.
ugh, do trailblazers not understand sarcasm?
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
she says what she thinks -- i like her. and did you hear what she said about the silvermane guards? haha, sounded like she'd been waiting a long time to say it. i think i'd get along with her.
not always, sometimes it's a happier conclusion.
sounds good to me! i support your decision.
what do you mean by that? you expected me to just keep running and hiding from my responsibility forever?
then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began five hundred years ago.
yes, you're right. i'm wary of any and all change, but i do not wish for my pursuit of eternity to stop human lives from changing for the better.
oh, is this the marketplace? it's a far cry from how i remember it.
huh? you don't believe it? just ask my classmates, almost everyone will tell you the same.
well... miss asta, we've made our decision.
gosh, the atmosphere here is so creepy and unsettling...
ah, how wonderful. everyone's keeping their promises today.
well, i thought since pom-pom can't leave the express, bringing a doll with us is kind of like taking them trailblazing.
let's do it! time to end the mystery once and for all!
so, how could i possibly resist it... i mean can you imagine? i can actually free myself from this icy medical cabin in this dream...
wow, where did the time go...
then come aboard and take a look for yourself.
oleg has always acted on my behalf -- he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the underworld.
i can see... she once walked in the rain, once burned in battle, and once held the cold ashes in her hands -- in a way completely different from mine.
i feel bad for making you go through so much trouble for me. if only i were more capable...
i only wish to express my blessings for the express. these are words specially imbued with a blessing of remembrance -- they hail from a distant, ancient planet.
he doesn't have a second personality, but... somehow, he still seems like he's at odds with himself in some way.
so... i can defeat him just like that?
why, this is the most exciting sub-plot of the novel: the secret investigation. i'm sure you must be curious about where the magical powers of the wisdom orb and floral jelly really come from?
the family recruited many artists, architects, and scholars from across the universe to form the team of dreamweavers that built the dream of penacony.
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching...
you mustn't hesitate -- recover every last reagent that vache left behind. i'll take responsibility for the consequences -- don't worry about that.
whoa... this atmosphere is crazy!
not bad... the actors' emotions were all on point, let's keep that take.
ha? we haven't even started fighting yet!
i just did what i had to do. you are special, after all... so special that many pairs of eyes are watching your every move.
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur...
i'm so glad haniyyah has finally worked things out...
yeah, yeah, we're watching.
were you seriously planning to leave this stuff unchecked at the dock for days? that's way too dangerous!
so... no one's gonna say anything? then i'll raise my hand -- i know the answer to this question!
...how is that gonna improve our chances?
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
now, let's work together, and make this show the best it can be!
um, this area wasn't guarded the last time i was here... have my frequent comings and goings started drawing attention?
i had to scare them a little, though. otherwise i hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
huh? isn't that the doctor lady?
ooh, good plan! treat the robots like guard dogs!
hehe. when i say rebellion, i don't mean betraying the shogunate... i mean, inciting a certain someone to betray the tenryou commission.
so you'll stay and keep her company, yes? don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
thank you for inviting me out. this trip has been quite eye-opening for me.
save it. you saw us in there and got scared, so you pulled a runner.
whoa! sounds incredible! but... are there any side effects?
what!? what's that got to do with anything!?
...please don't do this. he seems like a good guy! hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
hook, what's wrong? has someone been bullying you?
which leads us to why i'm in need of a high-precision celestial globe.
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
you found him! will he know what to do about this elevator?
huh? no, wh--what is that?
this is how penacony fell under the family's control. since the arrival of the harmony, the land of the exiles has undergone dramatic changes, not all of which have proven... beneficial.
oh! boss svarog's robots! what's his deal?
"thank you for your letter. though i have extended a response, i cannot answer your query due to your questionable motives."
even in the ice... could these guys still be alive...?
if you want to move the audience with your music, you must fully commit and immerse yourself in your role, pouring all your emotion into your performance.
i went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
(is it such an outrageous thing to do, anyway? to find someone in whom you can confide your frustrations and sorrows? surely, it could not hurt?)
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
hey, where are you going? the snowshine lamps are the other way.
items purchased in the dreamscape can also be brought into reality through an extra service. unfortunately, the transfer of automobiles to the real world is not available at the moment... you can come back for them next time.
she'll probably wake up soon... no doubt she'll be a little disoriented at first, but once she's got her bearings, she'll go and report that she shut down this disruptor.
mm... i truly hope so.
the child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some fried tofu.
well, as luck would have it, i happen to be in a good mood today. how about i tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
you're our good friends, which is why you didn't stop him from dropping out of this round, and why you don't feel disappointed in me.
when i heard the kids at the clinic talking about this "game," i thought they were just making things up again...
am i? i feel pretty normal. anyway, this case has really got my detective blood pumping. i need to get to the bottom of it...
but now i see that hers was a gaze full of delight and hope. it was not just a duty, but a joy, too. she loved humanity very dearly.
my question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
the bro or the sis? if you're talking about gepard, we should be careful... he's a top silvermane guard -- he'd probably get a medal for every one of us he brought in.
why are you fighting!?
wow, i never knew there was such a large lake here. it's so beautiful...
"a doctor does not get to choose his or her patient, my children. remember, never say no to those who come to you for help. never."
perhaps it's because... i'm the electro archon's familiar.
there's still some time before the next part of the script unfolds. let me stay a little longer in this body.
yes, photographs often record very precious memories.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me...
i had no choice but to scale the walls with some simple climbing ropes and sneak in from above while the corps of thirty wasn't paying attention.
ahem! s--seeing as our hosts are so thoughtful, i guess we should help ourselves. right, mister yang?
so it was all part of the plan! when dan heng stabbed you, i was scared to death...
her power was already on the decline. then you dealt her that fateful strike.
or, to save you the trouble, i can have someone from tenshukaku deliver it directly. but of course, your name will have to be written as the sender.
leave it here, and i shall sample it.
what an amazing daaaay!!!
if i find out they're preventing me from doing my job... or if they're bringing harm to my patients... i won't just sit on the sidelines.
maybe it's because i've finally become an ordinary person, and gained my freedom, that i've developed a great sense of curiosity about their lives.
no, wait. to be more accurate, it's urakusai's memory.
looks like miss sparkle is adding a little spice to the investigation. let's take her up on her offer then -- mister assistant detective, this way.
everything outside is... red. what's going on?
n--no! we're not on a date!
that aside... there were also my personal motives. i wished to travel with you as firefly... and not sam.
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
with a true heart and focused mind -- here i come!
makoto and you are inazuma's past and future, and both are indispensable.
well now, don't you all look disappointed? don't tell me that your investigation came up empty-handed?
i'm sorry... i feel a little dizzy. ugh... i...
i'm sure you'll have a great time. don't forget to send my regards to the supreme guardian while you're there.
the flow of turbulence may well have been influenced by makoto. but it took everyone's efforts combined to ultimately help ei. so this time, it looks like thanks are due to you.
who cares? they're here and alive. do they look like a mannequin to you?
thanks to captain gepard, we managed to keep our losses to a minimum. i'm sure people will begin to appreciate the silvermane guards after this battle.
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
as for the potential liabilities we didn't have time to discuss earlier... one good place to start might be the fungi power-up materials.
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
you took your time. i was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, miss "sole of the deep."
wait... it cuts off...
excuse me, any chance you saw a foxian lady pass by?
...you're really into clockie, huh? he's just a fictional character, not a real person!
i can't believe they've chased me this far... looks like we'll have to say our goodbyes. don't worry about me. just go and enjoy the ceremony!
why is our opponent... soulglad?
speaking of which, master gongshu -- what do you make of them? you're the best artisan in the whole commission, maybe you can pick up on something?
the most suspicious part is that no matter how much i ask, no one's ever willing to tell me anything about it... and that's where you might be able to help.
thanks to them, inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands...
we've had to fight every step of the way for this opportunity, but we now have all of the ingredients necessary to stage a truly spectacular performance:
you made a very high bid... the problem is that there are a lot of wealthy people lurking in the underworld.
me? oh, well, i bought some tea, of course. i just had to try all the varieties recommended in the steambird.
kamisato... one of the most distinguished clans in all of inazuma. eh? that's exactly what the shogun said? well, a--ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.
um, serval... won't more silvermane guards be waiting for us on the other side of the gear bridge?
i don't have to fight all of them... right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan...
a trial, huh... how exciting. i'll be looking forward to it.
how rude! questioning my cooking skills, the audacity!
remember my adoptive parents i mentioned to you a while ago?
she no longer needs the power of the gnosis, and in any case, she tells me she has severed ties with celestia.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
no clue, but i know one thing...
i used to always lose sleep because of those pests, but thankfully there's nothing like that here.
...fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
you must understand the situation you are facing.
that's good. i hope it's a little more satisfied with the way i am now, hehe.
thanks so much! we'll be waiting -- patiently.
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
especially these days. not only do i have my light novels, but i've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
enough... that's enough...
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back... or maybe i'm just describing myself.
true. dan heng's always saying that clara's really insightful for her age.
that red-haired contestant... who is that exactly?
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
so lyney proceeded to knock him out too before stuffing him into that box.
anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much -- it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
you keep playing. i'll go and get some drinks.
it is precisely because of their helplessness, because their visions have been taken from them, that their will is all the more precious.
scrap metal, huh?... the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
"stars hung from its branches..." then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
oh, i get it now. the last scene is all about singing the praises of the order.
i... i'm fine! look! look at me, everyone. my hand is still here. i haven't been dissolved!
(b--because, uhh... well, we're too law-abiding to understand bad guy logic.)
ugh, don't do this to me... hearing half a sentence is like developing half a photo. i'll be up all night thinking about it...
i will never forget you, and all that you did for inazuma.
so we'll take that elevator on the central platform to go down to the master control zone. do you know the way?
look, it's wilder! he should be able to get us registered for the competition.
oh, is everyone alright? thanks for your help.
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
really? wow. i dunno where you get your strength from...
where are our rooms? come on, mister yang and the rest must be at the front desk. let's hurry up and meet them there!
in fact, the name "baal" and the title of raiden shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up until--
huh, your job sounds pretty similar to the express crew's! aside from the "business," i guess...
i, um... uhh...
...though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
anyway. you're looking for a chance to shake my will... aren't you?
this is where we split up... she can't be too far away!
it's the power of tuning... don't let the song distract you!
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
you seriously think that would make someone laugh?
didn't she tell you? in private, she insisted on accompanying you.
but that general huaiyan, he looks... so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. is that old man really an arbiter-general?
i'm going to be the start of something new.
you're up next, little one. come on, sit yourself down here.
the real hydro archon? well, now you're really losing me.
let's try using the elemental monuments in the area.
ahh, watch out! behind you!
i am me. there is only one of me, but i can exist in many different forms. it's not important what form i exist in.
i believe that she's one of the best, even in a place like the akademiya, where geniuses come by the handful.
this question... surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us...
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
i don't need any help here, why don't you try asking someone else?
an inquisition spirit...? on the express?
what do you mean? are you not coming with us...?
wildfire can provide that while svarog is recovering.
i'm really sorry for bringing down the vibe! quick, dan heng, tell us a dad joke to lighten the mood!
this is also why you felt a sense of peculiarity when traveling with her.
huh? wh--what's going on? did we fall into another trap?
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
oh, i see. was i sleepwalking? i was, wasn't i?
...what's with these people!? they talk the talk then run off with their tails between their legs...
so you're basically saying the belobogians must pay off their ancestors' debts...
i'm sending you the next treasure map, let's go find the next pass.
it's all thanks to your amazing guidance, masters!
veronique! can we try a different kamera?
...such a huge area.
nevertheless, it appears that the kujou honor still courses through your veins
easy now, layla. all that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. the bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch...
oh, thank you so much. i really needed this.
you need not worry about the future, and you aren't alone.
hmm... but doesn't the way she suddenly told you to leave the city suggest that maybe she had some sense of what was about to happen? it almost seems as if she was moving you to safety.
it's the same routine. you've mastered it, right?
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder...
so in the vast majority of cases, the one he made tea for was the former electro archon... who was also my sister. raiden makoto.
i'm fine... sorry, i hope i haven't scared you.
the ever-flame mansion has set out on a journey. those poor people... they have no idea what lies in wait ahead of them.
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
what's the matter? i thought you were having fun.
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
what about me? oh, i'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels...
there's nothing like the smell of fresh ingredients. they already smell delicious.
the ipc are all about their sci-fi sorcery, so it's not that surprising. wanna go take a look?
perhaps the reason you do not possess a vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you... it's a possibility.
mister yang, you're smart. what happened just now!?
can you see that building in the distance? that's the famous grand theater, another great landmark of penacony!
huh? i just think that he... well, i, ah, think it might be a little early to talk about formally pressing charges...
maybe we could go on another trip together sometime?
...this is the approach ei has come up with for realizing eternity.
he has his own goals... and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
well... if you're okay, let's move on to the next stop, which is just a stone's throw away from here. please follow me...
let's give it a shake! nice, it's still fizzy and has a long shelf life!
get up! no one wins a trade war by kowtowing...
oh, the weather's terrible. shoot, if i can't see the sky tonight... ugh, i really can't put off my star mapping homework any longer...
*sigh* it's tragic... such wholehearted devotion, rendered meaningless by circumstance. have you been kept in the dark? or are you the only one left in the light?
*sigh* fine, looks like i can't keep the act up any longer. i even tried to look a little panicky to emulate her behavior.
i... i'm a lawful resident... at least now i am...
let's have a count. hmm, doesn't seem to be enough...
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
there's actually more than one memokeeper who's come to penacony -- she mixed me up with someone else. but no harm, no foul...
(huh, vanished in the blink of an eye. so, the astral express is here, too.)
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten... complicated.
a place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic... so, that was the "turbulence" i was sensing.
...is this treasure really more important to you than bringing peace to the kingdom?
phew... good thing i let him go alone -- my calming influence would've ruined his training.
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
so... as expected, he's missed the deadline.
thus did i give up all of my divine power to provide everyone with energy for their daily lives. have you ever seen a more magnanimous god?
...*sigh* from the sublime to the ridiculous... after all that, everything's come full circle.
i see... thanks, i appreciate it.
it's virtually impossible to destroy a stellaron. no one, not even herta, has found a way to break its structure. the best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
be careful. don't get fooled by her again.
found you! you ran all the way out here just to play hide-and-seek? it's too dangerous!
that won't be necessary. i've memorized every detail.
as much as it pains me, unfortunately, i should just stay put. i'm more like... a damsel in distress more than anything.
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
these puppets... where are they guiding us this time?
uh oh, i have a bad feeling about this!
...i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
uh... do you usually express disappointment this way...?
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
give up? ahh... i do love the sound of that phrase. it would mean finally coming to terms with fate, but also... for me to finally be free.
i see, that makes sense...
...just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
we youkai are not like humans. humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
ah no, we're here to rest... my problems will have to wait for now.
all this talk about food is making me hungry.
could it be...? that never even occured to me... but i guess it's not impossible!
hehe, you two make an adorable duo.
done! it took some effort, but we finally cracked these mechanisms...
*yawn* ... that's enough sightseeing and photo-taking to last me a while...
i didn't mean for you guys to start beating yourselves up over it!
don't worry, i haven't forgotten. i will be sure to remind the tenryou and yashiro commissions of their duties in this regard.
first on the list is the experiment to get observational data. i actually had it all planned out several days ago and even borrowed a celestial globe from a mahamata.
*sigh* i calmed down and thought about it a bit. if it turns out that woman isn't lying, then a lot of innocent people are gonna get hurt... now's the time for thinking about other people... hehe *sigh*
it's a good bow. it couldn't be meant for me... could it?
(hmm... seems bribing isn't an option.)
another wubbaboo! ...it's crying?
do you have to go back already? time really flies.
that witch! she was here waiting for us the whole time. show yourself, phantylia!
let's go and make an inquiry. we can also ask around the house of daena and see if anyone else knows something about the wisdom seelie.
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
everything i have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
i am focalors. the eyes of countless fontainians are upon me. i must, at all times, display the utmost elegance and nobility.
*whine*... my stamina's running low... let's keep the volume down.
wait... are you that stellaron hunter hacker girl? what are you doing here!?
here we go.... let's save the victory speeches for later.
looks like another completely new monster.
final duel? so you're finally willing to...
(they are still a ball of fire as ever.)
someone's not in the best of moods... let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
you have already witnessed my previous views on eternity.
think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
...this is not good. everyone, we must hurry.
you used to represent my past, but from today onward, you are me.
if i'm not wrong... it has to do with the watchmaker.
he may well have had an inkling about there being two "raiden shoguns." but he always acted as if he was completely unaware of it.
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
why don't you skip all this rigmarole and just have a heart-to-heart conversation with me? it might tickle a little.
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be... it doesn't seem to have any info on it...
we'd better hurry to the underworld and see what natasha and seele make of it all...
i do believe he was prepared for that outcome. i could see it in his eyes.
uh, i appreciate your kindness, but i really can't remember how we met... i'm sorry.
release my stress... oh, i see what you mean. being at the top of a mountain really does make someone want to yell out loud.
doesn't seem like it, everything else is working fine -- see?
i'm sorry, my dear. my dream dance partner... i've already got sights on someone else.
that's right, we'd never sell out our friend!
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine point five!
i would like to book the opera epiclese for an event. you see...
this time we're playing the role of a real detective... but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
aww... that's so nice of her. she's talking about us!
haha, it's a champions' welcome!
he wasn't lying. there's actually a bazooka here.
that's basically how i feel about it... even if i know nothing about the blessing, i could still feel its companionship all along.
i admit i'd made a transaction with that gentleman to bring you before him. but... this is also a safe place.
(hmm, i think i heard somewhere that it has a lot of ridiculous abilities...)
i wasn't sure. it was just a hunch, but since misha feels familiar with this place... my hunch might be correct.
although i may not be physically strong, my will is as resilient as they come. i'll be fine after i rest for a bit.
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
they let you take part!? when did this place last have an inspection!
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
quiet on set! places, everyone! lights, kamera, action!
...never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
you and me both! i can't wait to get inside and just flop and roll on that comfy bed...
i'd give it a ninety percent chance.
and parries should be fluid and nimble! got it.
my second question has to do with the ensuing duel. if the truth is indeed as you described...
miss sparkle also used it to attack mister shamari.
this is the residual memory from when the 'invitation' was first delivered... they were abruptly interrupted. then, what happened next is...
definitely the kind of place where you can have a proper rest and really relax.
there's also the saying: "from misfortune comes bliss."
why don't we keep up the momentum from our respective first-round victories? let's give our fungi some special training to strengthen our bonds with them.
huh? like... now? is this really the right time...?
we're not that old ourselves, right? and yet here we are -- express passengers on trailblazing expeditions!
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
hmm, so... in the end, we still have to start by talking to neuvillette...
oh, yes! i remember there was a florist in the overworld. how about we head over that way?
don't worry about it! that misunderstanding is all in the past now.
so, following the clues in the script, i came up with some theories about the meme. that's why i instructed silver wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel...
...that's an answer i can accept. oleg, what do you think?
before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
...how about we shove you back in the space station's computer, then?
besides, if we fail to uncover what's really going on in this tournament, we simply leave haniyyah to her own devices... who knows what chaos might ensue.
to tell you the truth, i'm still not sure whether i have what it takes to represent the rtawahist darshan in the championship.
the kitsune's sakura blossoms that once filled the skies fell to the ground as pitch-black rain...
uh... what's going on?
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
perhaps it's just my wishful thinking, but i think she did this deliberately, as her way of keeping our friendship eternal.
as it happens, i also received an invitation letter via sara.
no no no! no need! standing is just fine you don't need to do that...
ugh. is this what you usually eat? *sigh* seems i'll have to share some of my macaroni with you.
it's done! it came out great -- you're very photogenic.
indeed... and it all happened under my nose. how ridiculous -- my judgment was clouded by trust in a loved one...
i know, i know, but...
ooh! i'm the best storyteller -- let me! let me!
...sounds like you two are getting along! what's numby saying?
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow... none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
can't hide it anyways, penacony is plastered with our posters... and because the astral express is so well-known, the family won't dare to make any rash moves.
you've been explaining a lot about the venue, but i'm still confused about the game. can we actually give it a go?
wait, wait! why does it feel like everyone else knows something i don't?
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath... "exchange with your precious things."
but how long can your will remain strong?
huh, so everyone saw the same thing? i remember... it was a room, and then through a mirror, i came to a long hallway...
take your time, pick some good ones. i'll be right here.
nothing... i suppose my presence will be indispensable if we are to restore his faith in the show.
the first step is to grab a hold of the root cause of your anxiety.
the sacred sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously i get to prune it exactly how i like it.
with the mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony... looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
gah, so you're leading us on another wild goose chase?
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
i'm joking. that tree has been through a lot since it first sprouted. we have the loving care of kitsune over the ages to thank for how it appears today.
(you weren't even the one that learned "persuasion"...)
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
true... but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
miss black swan, we fully understand our current predicament now. going back to your original suggestion...
unfortunately, the remembrance doesn't lie... what we just saw is the "reality" that happened -- and it won't fade from our minds just because we wake up.
hey, take this! did it work?
miss topaz! miss asta!
the skit this time is a modernist one.
i really don't want to experience that feeling of despair again.
isn't this an encryption key for the elevator? with this, we should be able to use the elevator to reach the first floor of the storage zone.
understood. keep monitoring. keep me informed should anything come up at the institute.
...i could tell that although neither of us acknowledged it, we both knew that the road ahead would likely end in tragedy.
are you all there? here, like last time, repeat after me--
hee-hee, just telling it like i see it.
that's what friends are for, bronya! ...you don't sound like yourself. is something wrong?
hey! there are still wounded here that need our help!
and therein lies the largest complexity. derived and validated conclusions may vary due to subtle changes caused by the flow of time and shifts in the stars.
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
for centuries, manifestations of my authority have served the nation of fontaine.
i see... perhaps if we were able to find miss topaz, she'd be able to give us some clues.
uh... is this my room? i didn't get a chance to tidy up. don't judge...!
if that was the case, i would've already left on my own... just the idea of being watched by a sage is terrifying.
and when we were in dreamflux reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the crew... had ever talked with clockie.
the memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. in the memory zone of penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by black swan.
quick, there's more roots over here!
here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
she may have been a mighty hero in the eyes of her troupe, but... at the end of the day, she was only human.
their duty was to tear open a passage through space with their claws and teeth, and then call in even more powerful beasts.
(i feel utterly exhausted. best to rest early today, too.)
everyone on the express is a passenger.
i didn't expect the first lesson to be so intense...
...careful, there are some strange things on the wall... and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe...
it's times like these that a leader must stand up and do what's needed...
yeah! without her, even if we'd defeated svarog, there's no way he'd have given us access to the intel, right?
i see. well, even though it's highly unlikely now that i'll join your crew, there's still something i'd like to ask... exactly what film are you planning to make?
i'm going up against skott soon. i'm so nervous.
i don't see a switch for the gate.
looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence...
...that means we must be really close, right?
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but... there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
you two have my thanks. you have done much for me, and i will never forget it.
most people only pay attention to your tail, but those soft, pointy ears are really just as fascinating.
dango with milk... hmm, i've never heard of it. what made you want to do this?
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
just some shallow intuition... anyway, let's report back to the sheriff for now.
(all i can do is keep heart. i must maintain this act. it is the only way to save fontaine. please, "mirror-me." you have to succeed...)
this little clinic has huge numbers of patients to deal with every day... if i didn't have you here to help me out, i wouldn't be able to focus on giving them quality care.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this...
sometimes i stand at the door of the clinic and watch her running and jumping around... and my tiredness simply goes away.
well, if we can't see anything, that means we can't fight to the fullest of our abilities. should we... retreat for now?
the time our duels took to fight was long enough to witness the rise and fall of nations.
i...
but you, little one. just a quick fight and this will all be over.
and through it all, you also had your part to play.
well i'm still me. there is no doubt about that.
so i've been running a fool's errand this whole time.
everyone's waiting for you, so hurry up and pack. we're leaving as soon as you're ready!
(i couldn't think of anyone else to be mister yang's boss...)
not there. come back.
that won't be necessary, mister yang. as the angler once said: "a true detective operates as effectively from their armchair as from the scene of the crime."
hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face... i think it might be my favorite.
*sigh* and to think i could've been working on my thesis this whole time... ahh, my stomach is churning just thinking about it...
i haven't done this in a while... i kinda wanna give it a try.
i was just strolling nearby when i noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
which is precisely why i've decided to revive the irodori festival by...
but, it's a little... uncivilized, isn't it?
hi! do you work for the interastral peace corporation? or are you just dressing fancy today?
hehe, i agree... it's hard not to be.
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
well, never mind. what about one of you, then? anyone who can defeat me, takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new tenryou commissioner.
thanks, but i'm fine. i'm used to pushing my limits... i know how far i can go.
he... vache didn't give up on his research into blizzard immunity... even after he left the city.
infernal construction what now? how would we know anything about that!
that guy's been staring at us this whole time... hide-and-seek might have to wait -- let's see what he wants.
n--no! uh -- i've always seen you as a... m--masterful master diviner! hehe...
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
ugh... the syrup has turned clumpy... i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
the question is, do you know who we are?
sorry for the bother. you're too kind.
hahaha, i doubt she did it on purpose!
this is amazing! i'm so jealous, you're good at everything.
...heh, you truly have changed. i suppose this is what humans call "growth."
the xianzhou alliance... i've heard of them, but never had any contact with them.
while misha is a rather special memory zone meme, and he was granted power by the trailblaze... there's still one thing that he shouldn't be able to do--
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
for her, though... yes, probably a little too avant-garde.
i prefer how things are now. i can come and go as i please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
i think i'll leave that to the shogun. the greatest threat to eternity is still the erosion that comes with time.
after ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
we rescued him from the snow out of the kindness of our hearts. we had no idea he might be using us to get past you! are you really dumb enough to fall for his...
but you don't belong to this world. perhaps you are just the company she needs.
this is what trailblazing is.
in the end, even the proud and mighty oni maiden was cut down and disgraced...
there's also a letter here. was i planning to send it to someone? let's see who the recipient is...
ah!!! you scared me... why'd you wake up so suddenly?
she could think, "maybe i should just leave it all to her. i'm always relying on her anyway. why not let her live my life for me...?"
it can etch your memories in their most vivid form, and then... allow me to admire and manipulate them, turning them into unique mementos.
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
it's a shame they're too young to board the express. still, your stories of space adventures always put a smile on their face.
...understood, seele. this is a difficult decision to make, and everyone feels differently about it.
then... how did they turn against each other?
that's no ordinary kid. so young and yet so... stubborn? no, intelligent?
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
wow... this is astonishing. is it some kind of magic? it seems to be... another copy of me?
only sixty-three% of planets succeed? that's not exactly comforting...
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
hehe, is that so? how interesting. let's hear your reasoning, then.
okay, here we go... eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
i cannot. in my current state, even if i went out, i could do nothing.
hi there, have you heard of the legend of the wisdom seelie?
hey! that's not what we agreed on!
bye-bye now. come again soon.
whew... you scared the life out of me! we're here for the celebrations -- we're not looking for more conflicts...
haha, but seeing as you stumbled upon me, you aren't far from finding that person now.
is it true that hilichurls grow stronger from eating sunsettias? surely it should be some sort of meat, at least?
in return, i give you a blessing from me: good luck. i'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.
please, oh please just let me get some sleep tonight... i need it sooo bad!
i've never heard the name "arataki" before... but they must be one of my subjects, and so i thought, why not grant them their wish?
every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
uh... th--this isn't just hide-and-seek, okay? let me explain...
in this realm of consciousness, her existence is tenacious indeed.
"happiness is the dream of the humble." does this mean we can take it? something feels weird about this...
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
why...? what's wrong with the family?
well, give it some thought. i'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
uh... an emergency response plan...?
even though the protagonist refuses to acknowledge his innate talents, he has a rare dedication to justice.
dan heng, do you even have a heart? did you lose it somewhere?
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact...
we're counting on you, welt. as for us... let's get ready to see the dreamscape's true visage.
you rather sealed my fate there, with your "special thanks" at the end of the show.
but that can't be helped, right? we do many things not because we want to, but because we have to.
"it is believed that takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the souran isshin art, tominaga masanari."
hmph, you do it next time -- i'm tired of being the villain.
that's exactly what everyone back then told me as well. that it had existed since time immemorial. they were so matter-of-fact about it, and couldn't at all understand what i was so surprised about.
let's go. half the journey is still ahead of us.
it's... it's that hacker girl!
th-that's quite high praise...
those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
those books are a token of my goodwill to watatsumi island, and also my gift to you. i do hope you like them.
selfie, selfie... you're right. i've been here so many times. why didn't i think of taking a photo?
ahh... oh no. i'm losing it... so dizzy... ugh...
i knew i'd offended that diviner -- that's why she sent this girl to help us!
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
i hope these tests won't take too long...
c'mon, let's go talk to it and get the first treasure map.
very well. based on my investigation so far, i believe this next pack of monsters should be the last.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go...
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe... this is just too surreal.
ahem! miss ayaka, miss chevreuse, could the two of you please come over here?
*gasp* maybe this is how the architects repel the eternal freeze!
for example, i can foresee the outside world posing a threat to inazuma's businesses. these are the issues that i must work to solve.
it just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
but if the prophecy will come true, i'll also die anyway, right? so if i've already met you as my magical meeting in this world...
most of the tourists around at the moment are here to attend the wardance, and that's why we're here too.
i see... fine, i respect your choice. let's return to reality.
really? i've never been able to do it successfully myself!
hmph, you look ready enough to me. hey... are you messing with me again?
a world fettered by three paths, its destiny hanging in the balance...
i sure hope they're not arguing again... quick, let's head over!
if we'd had the chance to examine this notebook carefully back then, it would have been a conclusive piece of evidence, proving vacher's guilt.
please don't share any of this with her. i would like to keep this a secret, for both of our sakes.
let's move out then! but... where do we start looking for him?
we're in the middle of a take! couldn't you wait until we wrapped up this scene!?
huh? which next fight?
w-what's miss black swan doing here?
yes, otherwise i wouldn't be here.
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing... pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
you... when did you get here?
right now, let's follow her train of thought and head to the next puzzle. i hope this time we can get ahead of the bloodhound family. i want to try and avoid using my memokeeper powers.
huh, there's a cash prize?
i feel much more at ease knowing that i have it with me. i had thought that it would also help me calm my nerves in sumeru city.
reserved? really?
i fight for the everlasting future of inazuma. however long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
they will be teaming up with us to collectively create the novel that knocks "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" off its perch. so? feeling better about my plan now?
really? i was just explaining what it is i'm trying to do.
in the bar? but aren't all the ingredients right there on the counter?
we'll take those invaders out soon, don't worry.
just wait until you're a bit older, hook -- then you can go wherever you want~
furthermore, i had even predicted at the time that i may wish to modify the shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. however, such changes would not be conducive to eternity.
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
i'm not going to sign it, obviously. oh, and don't forget about our agreement.
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
what's this road of wisdom, and who's the child?
...back to copying me, huh?
everyone, we meet again.
okay, here we go...
...seriously? thanking us like that, and then immediately sending us on another mission?
...sorry, don't mean to sound cynical. maybe it simply represents the people's hopes up here.
hey! are you guys causing trouble again?
hey, it talks! and it knows that we aren't from this planet?
hmm, this does pose a bit of a problem. if we can't find your brother, well, we can't perform an exorcism with nothing to exorcise, can we?
erm... y--you don't need to go that far...
...see, i told you it wasn't going to be that simple. where is this?
it looks like "she" will no longer allow me to do with this body as i please.
no one likes regrets, myself included.
sit back and enjoy the duel.
wait, you guys went sightseeing in another town?
thank you for doing this for me... no, for us.
you can talk to me if you've something on your mind. in this world, there's no one who heals the heart better than a memokeeper.
hehe. gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
of course. let me know if another script like this comes around!
i did feel a little faint when i first entered the desert, but i feel a lot better after resting here for a while.
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
spices supreme... check out that sign. here it is!
it's freezing... huh? master diviner, aren't you cold? i can't stop shivering.
ahahaha... i'm not quite a hero yet.
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
"ultimately auspicious..." wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
this game allows people to work on themselves, or form strong bonds by teaming up with others. harmless rivalry is a great way for people to settle their differences.
so loud... the voice... it's becoming more shrill...
huh? what makes you say that? is there something off about me?
i'll discard that incorrect answer for you. take your time and think it through -- what is the fatal flaw?
don't take any of what i just said seriously! how could i possibly let fontaine fall to the whims of trivial prophecy?
also, please stop making it sound as if i somehow need the company.
i look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, mister lyney and miss lynette. that's enough for now. toodle-oo~
worth focusing on? ...oh, no problem. i'll leave it to you then.
by the time i turned around, the person had already vanished. so i handed it over to a nearby hound. i heard there were many similar reports before the charmony festival started.
your school practices meikyou shisui art, does it not?
so my plan is... to incite rebellion in the tenryou commission.
uh oh... which one was the original door?
but do you still remember? i said... "i have faith in your potential," and that's not a lie.
*sigh* i feel like... even though long-life species get to live forever...
such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, but as a means to an end... i need to put this aside for a more indifferent process.
see? even the oratrice has decided to show me its favor. are you sure you want to commit to a charge that will never be upheld?
o--okay, we trust you~!
yup! i always dreamed of a head-scratcher like this -- a chance to showcase my detective genius.
medicine... blizzard immunity...
hmm... dan heng, how long can humans live for?
...i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct...
ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy... i sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
i was so close to bursting into tears! that would've been embarrassing...
phew... we're finally done.
uh... i don't think we're at that stage yet. miss topaz seems like a reasonable person.
i had some spare time, so i decided to come out for a stroll. oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
when the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the grand narukami shrine. once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
even if i had that kind of power, i wouldn't dream of abusing it. i assure you, the dried fruits and pastries i brought are quite ordinary.
that's bronya! h--huh? is that cocolia too!?
all you need to do, dear spectator, is to witness my performance until the curtains fall.
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes... they must have come through here.
stop! don't you dare insult xianzhou swordplay like that! if you have the guts, i'll show your mechs what i can do!
i understand why you're trying to make her the hero of the story, but... isn't she your hero already? after everything she did for you?
the silvermane girl? she's pretty. i like looking at her.
huh... it's just, there are less painkillers than i'd expected. did someone break into the storage room?
so that's it... even the villains in opera performances rarely go that far...
e--extermination? in the literal sense?
(i'm beat... but i haven't felt this happy in a long time. i'll try and power through a little longer...)
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
if it's so simple, why didn't your master diviner come and do it herself?
don't think of it that way, miss haniyyah. spending time with shroom buddies is actually really fun! right, twirly-whirly?
heh, well, i was the biggest star in all of fontaine, after all. it takes more than just a pretty face to earn a reputation like that. i know how to get serious when the situation calls for it.
if you're lucky... perhaps tomorrow you can return to the overworld.
since you're here... can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
your ailments need rational, scientific treatment. relying on pseudo-medicines will only worsen your condition...
that statue... did it just speak?
this area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. i guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.
#{nickname}, get the kamera ready! paimon, get the clapperboard! actors, to your positions! we're about to start shooting the first scene!
...well, this is how it turned out.
ahem, alright! then the matter's settled! now that everything's been taken care of, there's no reason for us to keep looking all gloomy and grumpy.
...but it's impossible to sit on the sidelines, right?
the shogun's army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this shuumatsuban ninja, i'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
yeah! it can't heal if we take out the source, right?
wait a sec, did gepard say that he's in rivet town? could that mean topaz is...
that's more like it. ah, one more thing...
the tvs are so bright, it's hurting my eyes... careful, something's up...
oh, really? you mean it?
my dear people. whether you acknowledge me or not, whether you trust me or nay, i say to you -- keep faith in your ardor for justice!
from the traces they've left in the surrounding area, there should be many more monsters nearby. all of them must be eliminated.
still remember what i taught you? feel the flow of the memoria, walk up the wall, and then... get close to it.
that hand of his! it's gonna explode!
she sure did put a lot of work into this gag, and i think we're the punchline.
...what would wildfire do with her? what would they do with you?
well, it's not often we have the chance to chat. i'm sure you must have a lot of questions?
you don't know? but surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
really? i thought she was pretty icy...
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
i will admit that i've been running away for a long time.
he cast aside his physical form in order to etch the memories of rage and sadness deeper into his being.
huh? what's this... did those guys leave it behind...?
if you thought childe had nothing to do with the serial disappearances case, it is only because you have been blinded by the superficial appearance of innocence...
i really wish i could spend the whole day talking to her about the old days. but sadly now is not the time.
that massive tree has suddenly sprung to life!
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
as for the suffering... well, i will admit that the first thing that came to mind was, "why do i have to be the one to suffer?"...
by the look on your face... i'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
the boar's not a bad character, actually. he's the one who raises the little oceanid, yes?
hmph. you are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. descendant of the takatsukasa clan, you wish to become the new tenryou commissioner. do i understand this correctly?
none. no one has seen the devotee of eternity since she shut herself away. in fact, no one even knows what it looks like in there.
well, it's nothing too poetic. i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived at the xianzhou ship...
o--okay. well, in short, it means that the results derived from astrology are prone to change...
and then, a new page will be turned.
alright, go and take a look around. there should be a mechanism somewhere that makes the whole room move.
it's almost like how you helped me -- i really cherish and appreciate it. after all, it wouldn't be right to take such "blessings" for granted in our lives.
they may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. i need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
toodle-oo to you too. i'm going home to take a rest now.
you can go and... have a look around?
ahhhh! wh--what is that!?
you really understand more about life than i do.
huh? are we starting now!?
what? a critical success? your luck is through the roof today....
wait! hold on!
oh shoot, we lost...
then... we'll keep it for now...
when you're free, let's go hit up the divination commission together and see what fu xuan has to say.
i'm sure he didn't get lost. even i was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
ahem... my current research is about a certain phenomenon called "astral shift."
oh, must be the key to the big door...
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
alright, let's give it another try. lights, kamera, action!
all the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. i stand before it alone and unchanging.
if the first clue was any indication, then the location described in this clue should also be related to my life experiences.
isn't this fight way off from the actual storyline?
oh, don't listen to the shogun. desserts! cavities are no big deal -- you can just replace your teeth. anyway, i just don't see how desserts can pose a serious obstacle to my pursuit of eternity.
hehe, thanks pela -- we'll do our best!
if we were looking down from on high, i wonder whether we'd find that the ley lines are just the reflections of the stars upon the earth?
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
haha, that won't be necessary -- i can't imagine march reacting well if her camera went missing. besides...
is that pela? looks like she's teaching the kids again.
ugh... let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
the traveler is right. you once investigated that underwater sinthe base, and recovered items belonging to the victims.
maybe neuvillette was right... maybe "clio" is the right role for me.
i used to be terrified of the gaze of other people, especially when they had suspicion or resentment in their eyes.
no way! the boss will recognize us, plus silvermane guards are stationed nearby. we'd be offering ourselves up on a silver platter!
now, let's leave this place... please close your eyes.
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
l--love poem? quick, put it back!
it looks like he really has no intention of imprisoning us. if it's just a quiz, i suppose it's fine to humor him.
hehe. come now ayato, we're not strangers here. there's no need to sound so formal.
but upon his return, in cruel avarice, lyney desired sole credit and prepared to do away with his partner-in-crime.
hehe, it wasn't a big deal, really...
i only found out later that first snow represents "beautiful memories." my parents gave me a beautiful childhood, and i still haven't had the chance to thank them for that...
did you know what was about to happen in khaenri'ah?
well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, hehe...
what about your integrity, huh? you brought the other kids out here to rivet town, didn't you?
...just the thought of our lives being predestined from birth makes me shiver!
you should know that these actions make you an enemy of the astral express.
thanks so much! ahh, you guys are the best!
yeah, but that was before the robbery. i was just passing through...
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
hey! don't pull on my hand, i -- ow, ow, ow, hot, hot, hot!
no, i'm not questioning your abilities. it's just that, i've never really seen you use a kamera before.
indeed, my dear, loyal citizen, this joyous moment is an honor for us both!
i should take action when i'm needed and give it my all when the moment calls.
the monsters committed many atrocities on inazuman soil. and the rifthounds were always their advance guard.
wait, so she... handed an actual sword to a child? isn't that dangerous!? did you hurt yourself?
from what i've gathered, it seems like most people in the overworld are leaning towards signing the ipc's contract.
a familiar flavor... acceptable.
and for good reason, no? a bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
oh... okay... i've got a pen and paper with me. let me go through them real quick.
hey, be a bit more serious. we're live on air!
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see...
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap... he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
yes. it was too late. i arrived only in time to hear her dying breath.
just how much work did you do to force me onto this stage?
he's done right by us so far... shall we head over?
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
camera, check. extra clothes, check. toiletries...
helping those in need, befriending those worth counting on, and saving the world a few times along the way...
sure enough... the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
ugh, it's so cramped in here...
has anyone seen what it actually looks like? or what kind of a person it is?
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
what's wrong? that beast tamer, is she... angry?
if i were to die now, i would only be a weapon. i believe... i should die as a human.
we're going to the opposite side, right?
geez... i can barely even hear myself think!
we've walked pretty far now.
moving containers, picking locks... seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
a world that many across the universe don't even know exists...
if i can make it to the quarterfinals, i'll get to take my shroom buddies home and delegate some of my physical labor to them. of course, i'll take good care of them too.
suit yourself. worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is ei, so what's the big deal?
let's walk while we eat. it's time to head to the next stop!
all i know is that it's the foundation of the sacred sakura, and from what i have heard it's a little different from ei's "plane of euthymia."
wait, we're having actual combat training for the first lesson?! isn't that a bit too intense?
so... you do have secret strength!?
i think they'll be fine... plus svarog's devotion to clara is even greater than his hostility to wildfire. if you're worried, you could look for them over at the robot settlement.
but the vagrants here have keen eyes -- they couldn't keep it hidden from them. some local gangs wanted to profit from the situation, so they blackmailed the mining team for hush money... and that was the final straw.
mom... i have so much to say to you, but there's an urgent matter that needs your help.
whoa! my sword is talking!
conductor, can i get a juice, please? thank youuuu~
hey, what's that commotion? it sounds like there's a big argument happening...
...huh, that's weird. i bet the conductor won, right?
and even the ones who don't believe it still go out of their way to avoid that place.
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
i'm sure you've all heard about how i have taken on the role of hydro archon. indeed, i am furina de fontaine, your new archon.
"sparkle has disguised herself as another character"... wouldn't that be you, mister sampo?
ah, you mean that naughty kid we played hide-and-seek with?
(this voice... it's not constance. could it be her companion?)
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
that's the friendliest thing i've heard since we arrived!
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
in bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. also, sales for the book would only increase further.
*sigh* ...come on, those toys of yours aren't that dangerous.
and there he goes again... i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
still, i felt it was something i had to do. as i was saying before, i want to see for myself the things that i never could in the past.
after some system hours, the words will turn into a common language that everyone can understand.
the truth is... we are on the same side.
oh, okay! i'll be looking forward to it then.
lack of sleep hinders my ability to focus, and if i can't focus, i can't do any proper research or thinking. i'm stuck in a vicious cycle.
a play... hmm...
i see... anyway, i'm glad you're safe!
declining would be like admitting defeat! of course i'll accept it!
i... of course not...
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
or get him to hand over his memory bank. we could go through it ourselves.
the memories i have of you are not enough for me to predict a future that lies too far ahead.
hey! don't say something like that in front of these healers! i don't want to end up in some realm-keeping commission court!
"a small something for the lost..."
so, i only hope that justice will be served in this matter. don't overthink it... i'll go find someone to arrange the meeting...
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
so, you seem to be under the impression that i am able to offer some sort of help? who gave you that idea?
i'm writing a letter to the astral express. it's been a while, and i thought i should let them know that i'm safe and sound here.
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
is it a message from mister giovanni?
...really? feels like you're tricking me...
oh? hello there, little ones.
at this point, i would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you... but i think you get the picture now, don't you?
she had no other way to leave but from the side corridor.
you've never really seen us as outsiders, huh.
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
the atmosphere here... looks similar to sunday's inner world. perhaps this so-called "stage play" is created with his abilities.
...now's not the time for those thoughts. i need to focus on treating the injured.
jeez, you sound just like those parents on the xianzhou! can't i get some praise now?
...i understand.
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to... wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
then it seems like we've reached a consensus. i have a feeling that this will turn out to be the most mesmerizing performance of your lives.
let's head towards the first victory zone -- corridor of fading echoes!
...i'm a kind of allergic to those types of situations. i think i'll just head back to my room and start packing.
back here again...
ah!? who would do such a horrible mean thing!?
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
however, even though svarog is no longer sealing off the furnace core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
so, have you thought things through?
the answer lies with the three of you. i'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
all very true. an original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. this is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
this is your plane of euthymia. it's your inner world.
the thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free... oh, i just couldn't wait any longer.
i caught some very familiar memories just now -- she's not the only *old friend* who has appeared here. there was also a third party at the scene when you ran into danger...
i... might've exaggerated your condition for sampo's ears... but that guy owes me. he better bring me back some medicine.
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
i plead not guilty. how can i be guilty?
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide... this kind of work was made for him.
if all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then clockie's counterpart is definitely the watchmaker.
for your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
hmm, what sauce should i pick for my macaroni tonight?
well, i'm not a member of the club at all. clorinde simply woke me up first thing this morning, said there was a good script worth experiencing, and asked if i wanted in.
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown...
look, it's common sense and easy, right?
hey, march. that's a big smile on your face -- what's the good news?
what are you up to, sampo? why do you insist on getting caught up in overworld affairs that have nothing to do with you? if it's a whole lot more attention from wildfire you want, you're going about it the right way.
where's this anger coming from?
miko... a few days ago, some strange paper notes flew into tenshukaku, demanding that i "hand over the dog"... so i am here to see what on earth it was all about.
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur...
this is the grand narukami shrine, after all. ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the shogun herself...
i'm sure she knows it better than i do.
yeah, if that's all a villain did in an immersia, i'd definitely be asking for a refund.
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
that's fine. since it's something that took place in inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
staying vigilant wasn't the issue... it was the not knowing whether i'd ever be able to let my guard down again...
hehe, just wait until i go back, everyone's going to be so wowed by my new skills.
do you have any tips for dealing with that?
here's the situation: the clinic is packed full of people injured in the mines incident. since you helped us resolve things, seele and i have been busy caring for them.
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
i heard you won against the unstoppable hardy two-blades... but you don't seem too happy about it. how come?
if others were to find out i agreed to work with you so easily, then, well...
(oh! do i smell a redemption arc?)
there's only one way to find out -- let's go ask. i've always found ipc staff easy to talk to.
he was, but not anymore.
workshop? i'm not too sure about that... let's see if we have other options.
hehe, i told you compliments make me better.
but all my efforts proved to be futile in the end. really, the truth has been clear to me for a very long time...
that took long enough. now then, if everyone would lend me their attention.
so what happened back there? why did the supreme guardian send people to arrest us?
patience, my friend. i will reveal the answer to you... but that time is not now.
hah. it's my shrine. if i say you're qualified, then you're qualified.
well, we didn't get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top ipc executive!
still... i will give them a little more time. after all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
nice, it's sweet. the sensation is not so different from eating a dessert. a unique beverage indeed.
you needn't worry. the leader of watatsumi island took some troops to clear the place out. she's also issued a strict ban on the use of delusions across the whole army.
(...is he just feigning ignorance for my benefit?)
that's what i really meant when i said i'm no good at maintaining relationships.
alright, alright, stop joking around. the lightning-lord may be all-powerful, but they're not going to cause sudden memory loss. i'm just glad you're fine.
a friend. we, um... i'm having a little trouble with my thesis, and we happened to be passing by...
we can ask jessie for help! i've gotten to know many locals while waiting for you guys.
besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the grand narukami shrine unless you had a request for me, too. this is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
oh, i forgot to tell you.
oooh this is hard! what else should i take...
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit... they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
are such haphazard instructions really okay...
oh? dear me, don't you trust me? i'm heartbroken...
if you have time, talk to the folks here -- every one of them will tell you about their excitement. then, when you're ready... let's "go home."
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
oh, i remember you mentioned something about strange dreams before...
just thinking about it makes me wanna pass out...
let's get back to the feast and enjoy each other's company. we'll be starting the post-production process tomorrow.
unless blizzard immunity is real...
well... of course. how else could i be reading this message...? seriously.
if so, then you underestimate me. i am quite well-informed about the vision hunt decree.
i'll definitely be putting in a few words next time we meet yukong...
i am currently unwilling to deal with any business. i am also incapable of it.
i have high hopes, though. this seems like miko's style, so i'm sure the stories are very entertaining.
although, if what dan heng said is true, i doubt something that could swallow the express would be a picky eater...
exactly! a--and we even have photos!
currently, the shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. so the easiest solution was to announce that i am resting.
the exit... is on the other side? how're we going to cross over...
repeat after me. "three, two, one, one, two, three, ahhhh, ahhhh." come on.
well whatever, we won... thanks to that giant robot, we were finally able to take care of the stellaron... and bronya made a promise -- the underworld and the overworld will soon be reunited.
let me see... hmm, looks like she's basically gathered all the information she needs. it won't take long to wrap this up.
please, you're always encouraging me. i'm starting to feel embarrassed.
looks like you guys have the situation under control. thank you.
if it wasn't for your encouragement, i probably would've quit halfway through and holed up in the akademiya somewhere...
...no! i can't accept this!
the annual express spring cleaning? i love tidying rooms! i'll clean everywhere as best i can!
you're stronger than you look... seem to be quite the fighter.
little misha and old mikhail's homeland... having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
could you be any less discreet!?
fine. a promise is a promise. since i promised to study hard, i'll do my best starting today!
*sigh* anyone here surprised? anyone?
good thing someone from the eremites heard me shouting for help. they managed to scare off the leopards.
it's okay if your questions are a little off. i'll still treat them as real questions from an adviser and answer seriously.
you keep asking the champions of each venue to give us cryptic hints, don't you? what's that all about?
why did you turn into this... thing!?
"if you become human... you can reveal your secret to no one. you will face suffering and loneliness. is this truly what you want?"
at some point, she started going down a path that became increasingly difficult for me to join her on.
where's our next stop? we should find somewhere to put our feet up, as long as it's not goethe hotel again...
yeah, let's go! we've got some time before we board the ship, so let's catch up with everyone at dreamjolt hostelry.
so, you're the key in the end, i assume?
i dunno if the clues are following a timeline or if they're based on the amount of regret i have... either way, this incident was bound to come up sooner or later.
still, it's got the same stony expression, haha.
miss fu xuan, do people in memories always say weird stuff like this?
i knew i couldn't hide it from you.
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing...
it feels like my entire body is bubbling with excitement after yelling like that.
what, you're leaving already? but you haven't asked me about my dreams! i've been working hard too, you know!
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge...
oh, no i... i'm actually having a lot of trouble with it...
even though i try to fall asleep, i can't get the championship out of my head... and before i know it, it's morning again.
grandpa? do you mean... you're the watchmaker's grandson?
uh... is he talking about us?
so tell me. what, specifically, makes this matter so... specific?
i'm gonna need more practice. i can feel myself getting flustered, and i start to stumble whenever i'm asked questions that i'm unfamiliar with.
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know...
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
speaking of the story... why is the beginning scene on a beach?
i wish it were made up... unfortunately it's all true.
but the equipment was a little heavy, and i didn't notice that the ground was muddy and some spots were unstable.
th--this robot's a thousand times bigger than svarog!
(a performance? i've never played a roleplaying game like this before, but even i can tell that suggestion is pretty far-fetched. is a performance check really going to help here?)
it's a shame, though, that this pawnshop can't give me what i desire. my last attempt in penacony... well, it ends with "hope."
c'mon, you still haven't figured it out?
absolutely! i've learned a lot from my adventures!
say no more! we're good at this. don't worry!
warriors of the past who spilled your blood on this land, your noble souls now rest in this earth.
phantylia... what is she doing?
i didn't ask for the clapper loader's commentary, paimon.
uhh... my head is spinning...
however, i feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so i used the identity of the shogun.
oh? such a hasty refusal. do you think that's wise? goodness, who knows what tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it...
look! seems like he's coming around.
sure enough, it's here, and in a really obvious place. that pretty much confirms my hunch about the seelie's intentions.
miss acheron, i have a suggestion: why not split up and look for a way out, and meet up again when we find something? that would speed things up.
see that robot over there, the one that looks like a jellyfish? that's probably one of the service robots madam herta was talking about, right?
is everyone clear? i don't want anyone traipsing around the set like umbrellafinches.
unfortunately, given that said antagonist is under the protection of two commissions and the raiden shogun, we would be rather hard-pressed to track them down.
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
i've lost... if i can't even handle this kind of training, there's no way i'll beat skott...
i seldom had the time to drink tea. any free time i had was spent practicing martial arts.
such tight security... i bet they're stumped by the case as well.
i guess it's... time for us to say goodbye...
ah, it's too late for regrets... i'll let that one go.
...she left, just like that?
wait a minute, we forgot to ask seele! let's go see what she has to say.
smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. that is how yae miko wages war!
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
so... so we did it?
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang...
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm... i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
in truth, i know little about becoming a nation's new god, but it will be my honor to guide you all.
i see. thank you so much.
what am i gonna do... why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish...
hey! this level of gaming is just perfect for me!
alright, but there are doors all over the place... which one should we choose...? do you have any idea, misha?
oh, i know where those are... my darshan has us use those two books quite often.
we are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
wow, that was fast... don't you have anything you wanna bring with you?
be it vache or the mutual aid society -- forces like that can take full advantage of the... the typical underworld state of mind.
ahaha, you're too kind... wait, you're giving me a gift? shouldn't it be the other way round?
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
hmm... i give it a nine point eight!
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
aratani and kuroda, how are things coming along?
huh, glad i saw this. i almost didn't even notice it.
ah, sorry, i'll take the little ones away right now.
"th-this is great! i love living on the... w-wild side!"
you guys sure have a toxic company culture over at the ipc...
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us...
huh, so is this game already popular in belobog?
eh-he, to be honest, we don't actually know...
looks like we'll have to play this little game of sparkle's then.
in the meantime, i expect the takatsukasa clan to continue supporting the kujou clan as before.
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
so the ei of the present planted the sacred sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the inazuma of the past...
hmm, lemme think about what would be interesting for you... ah, i know!
*sigh* i'd love to sit down and chat with all of you, but i still have a backlog of patients to see.
what!? hold on, are you serious? i thought you'd be against it for sure!
oh? so you're a mind reader now, too...?
i'm sorry. the dance partner of my choice... i've already chosen.
hmm... probably a scene from ancient inazuma.
hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. i'm really glad i decided to come to qiaoying village.
don't worry, mister yang.
but what inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like makoto.
alright, i'll wait for you here. make it quick, though. i can tell you some other stories when you return.
they've already left, leaving this kindhearted girl to wake you up. you owe her big time.
thank you for understanding. i'll return it in perfect working order once i'm finished with it.
phew...i nearly suffocated! what kind of plot device was that...
it's unfortunate -- the six-phased ice that once enveloped her carries its own mysteries, and miss march has amnesia about her own past...
but without a doubt... she is the most "special" guest at this banquet. it's like aventurine said just then. it's best to keep your distance from her.
why don't they sell soulglad in this bar? did something happen?
no... but i used to think we were so close that we may as well have been...
"the person present, who shouldn't be"... who could it be?
how about it? can you feel the memoria flowing around you?
i guess that's possible, he could be a masked fool after all...
mm... shall we go meet up with them now?
...easy now, seele. anger isn't good for one's health.
there'd be no point in him lying to me in the letters. still, it's possible he may have gone completely insane before he started writing them...
(so, this is the radiant feldspar... so luxurious.)
the old and broken weapons...
on the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. but aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
wait, what's going on...?
plus... it seems unlikely that there would be two lethal entities loose in the dreamscape.
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
...why would you suddenly ask a question like that?
you should stay here, little layla. i understand that you want to help haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. leave it to them this time.
stop! you've gone too far!
i'm guessing... you two came to talk about them, right?
this time, we're not being forced or enticed, or chasing after wanted criminals. and we didn't have to sneak in through the cargo dock. this trip has been incredibly smooth...
are you two... *gasp* the people in dark clothing? what's with the wardrobe change?
yeah, that's usually how it goes.
before joining the stellaron hunters, elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. that's all he said. as for the rest, it's up to me to find out.
...when i traveled around inazuma with you, i caught a glimpse of how the nation has progressed over the centuries. a glimpse of human potential. everything far exceeded my expectations.
but for now, at least... i think i should stay with the way i'm feeling for a while longer.
i'm just a little curious. isn't it really tiring for miss sparkle to play so many different roles?
speak quickly, unless you want to earn yourself a one-way ticket to coupon-town.
that's righ-- hey! this is supposed to be a happy moment!
...that's just my charm! and i didn't cause any trouble. you just have to get used to me... look, dan heng agrees, right?
you're the one who needs to leave. i'm not letting this go.
isn't this... a sword technique? shouldn't i be saying something cool?
w--wait a minute! this isn't what we agreed! she said we were gonna be escorted to discuss an urgent matter!
...i suddenly don't feel so tired.
people die, and i am no exception. death is like a script, a fate that cannot be defied. but that's exactly why...
look, the ambrosial arbor's roots...
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those...
is everything okay? wait, isn't that... peak? don't tell me he fell asleep in the middle of the road again.
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
but who would launch such an obvious attack? they just want to stir up chaos.
veronique, do we have any other spare ones we can use?
it's just as well, really, with the amount of effort it took me to get you back here. honestly, it was like you were glued to the ground back there.
the plane of euthymia. essentially, the world inside her mind. a place that typically only allows her existence.
...it's like it's been erased? who's done this...
...*sigh* i guess i wasn't quite ready for this after all.
(from there, we should be able to predict its movement. alright, let's give it a try.)
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist... it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
i've never been great at maintaining relationships. besides, anyone i've ever worked with probably couldn't wait to get rid of me...
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
in my opinion, there is no murderer for this case.
i believe in your potential. it is rare for someone to have such a carefree, optimistic disposition.
but with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, i need time to give it some thought.
guess i'll head back as well. i need to save my energy if i want to continue enjoying the story tomorrow.
so, how about this? i've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
*sigh* anyway, let's look at the clue we've found.
okay. is everyone ready? i--i'm gonna do it.
aaaah!!! how come it hurt even more than the other two!? hmph, at least that's the final step...
i'm really sorry for waiting until now to tell you everything.
not to be rude or anything... we've been watching their drama. i'm dying to find out who beats who.
the embodiment of the harmony? so, the true purpose of the charmony festival... is to usurp it?
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
true, but i have made a decision to retire from the stage.
i will use my blade to confirm whether you are out of practice or not.
kaveh, meanwhile, knows what he wants to do -- he's convinced that he has to win -- and yet, he still seems conflicted...
so that's why you were so silent! hmph, if you wanna be as awesome as us, you better start training every day~
a day isn't that long. let's see what kind of case this big-shot outlander can build in such a short amount of time. hehehe, i'm really quite looking forward to hearing it.
that crook cheated us out of five hundred strales.
be at ease, i'm not here to see commissioner kamisato. actually, i'd prefer to spend this time chatting with the traveler. please, fetch the tea set at your convenience.
true heroes in immersia don't merely settle for "satisfying!"
is that the jade gate? it's huge!
one after another, people were taken by the water... all those treasured lives and memories, washed out of existence in an instant.
yes. inazuma was facing many great crises at that time. some were local in origin, while others... others came from the now-fallen kingdom of khaenri'ah.
i see... it all makes sense now. you must've used most of the budget to pay for the copyright.
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy...
yes, that's exactly what i'm saying.
well, what do we have here?
ah, then perhaps we should thank the stars that we were able to wrap both of your parts so quickly today. switching around the filming schedule would have been a real pain.
oh my, i'm human and so are you. can you get a grip...
so how big was it? bigger than the express? bigger than herta space station? no, that can't be right.
do you think... they're here to welcome us?
a gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. hehe... don't you agree?
that's why, no matter how tiring or how hard it gets, i won't let my family down. they are already an important part of me.
oh, don't worry about it. i don't sleep very well, so i tend to get a little dizzy from time to time. i'm fine now.
there's also a "dream's eye" left here by a dreamweaver... we're running out of time, we'll have to use it if necessary.
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
i'll give you a clue: she's currently in charge of the shogun's army, she visits the shrine at this time every month, and she is our guest today.
i wish to borrow a tea set from the yashiro commission.
come on down already. everyone's staring at you!
no... that's not right... you're trying to express disappointment. why do you sound so chipper?
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? or... was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
seriously? who puts a lamp there... there's no way we can directly load the thermic core into this one...
please... you've got to believe me...
mister oswell? i thought you headed back home with mom. how come...?
you see these people? they're all miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
um... haha, you're right, himeko.
is there any chance the seelie could have taken the books out and returned them without being noticed...?
yeah, and that's when i started having sleeping problems... i just began to sleep less and less each day.
wow! we wiped them all out in a single explosion! that's what you call efficiency!
exactly, this is where you and firefly encountered "death", which we now know as "dormancy". considering its connection to dreamflux reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
and all the while, i played my part to perfection to convince them that was true...
hey, look, it's mister giovanni!
these two are my friends! as for the man lying on the ground... he's a scaredy-cat who fainted from fright.
apart from its creator, i fear no one knows how to deactivate it.
(he had to set up so many scenes today, and now, he has to join in for this last part... i really don't envy his job.)
you have to try this fish. it's found exclusively in the waters around seirai island. they shipped it to inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until i ordered it.
looks like the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.
i have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the tenryou commission at present. does this have anything to do with kujou kamaji?
honestly, when i heard the conductor's request, i was pretty surprised.
i feel like going back to reality and resting too... come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
after the reopening of the furnace core passage, i had an idea. i wrote a letter and asked sampo to deliver it to my parents' old address.
at the same time, the blessing of remembrance will fall upon everyone. please look forward to this surprise.
hold your horses, cowboy. it's for those to decide.
thanks. i feel like i'm starting to get the hang of it.
this moment has finally come... i always get stuck here for a long time, but it also means i'm getting to the endpoint.
she mentioned that this transaction involves the watchmaker, and that often means stepping on many people's toes.
master diviner? can you hear me? darn it... something must have gone wrong!
alright, the jig is up, your voice gave it away...
this guy doesn't seem like the negotiable type. what should we do?
by the way, where is your general? didn't you say he would be joining you?
oh, all right. you stay safe.
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
that would suggest that zhongshan is not the murderer.
fear not. fighting is what i do best.
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
it appears that the seafarer has nothing to do with the watchmaker. so, perhaps it's just a coincidence?
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger....
so i'm not going to perform, and that is that.
ahem, yeah... but to go up against yunli is quite impressive, you know? that aura of heroism and grace. it almost makes me want to learn xianzhou swordplay!
so think hard about what that means. and then think again about what you hope to achieve by arguing with each other.
whether it's a one-off or not, it's a boundary that i've committed to no longer cross.
well, you should really be thanking sampo. if it weren't for his intel, we wouldn't have made it in time.
phew, i'll take a monitor over a red-hot heater any day...
wait a minute -- clear my head of what!?
wakening... which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
uh... you want us to help you? what do you need?
and that's it, that is all that's happened so far.
ah! don't expose my net handle to everyone!
didn't i make myself clear at the time? the decisions of the gods are naturally difficult for humans to comprehend. there is no need to provide an explanation...
the more i think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
what's with all the people gathered around? what happened?
yeah, mine nearly scared the daylights out of me when it started glowing! i took a good look at it after we got out, but i don't think it ever lit up again.
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
in that case... let's make our way to the end.
looks like it didn't work...
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
huh? what do you mean? ...do i look excited?
those were the happiest days...
it inherits ei's pain -- the pain of inevitable loss that comes as she moves forward. so too does it inherit her determination to reach eternity.
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
hey! shh! that's a secret!
i see. so compared to a distant and uncertain future, what you really care about is making sure the people around you have a good life...
yeah, yeah, i get it.
don't worry, i'm just...
okay, we don't have time to really look into it right now. let's strike while the iron is still hot, and wrap this thing up once and for all.
you won't fit in the suitcase! can't you walk?
alright then, let's bring this journey to a close!
have you ever seen anyone outside of the crew interact with misha?
these memory fragments are as fine as dust, and can't form memory bubbles. they're hard to see with the naked eye -- even most memokeepers can't sense them.
...a draw? this isn't a tournament, y'know! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
the stage is already set, so there's no reason to disappoint the audience. let's see this trial through to the very end!
waaaaaah!
now comes the tricky part. how do we do it?
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here... mind if we ask you a few questions?
whoa... i felt like i suddenly lost weight when we passed through.
unpredictable pathways pointing toward a wandering meme... she was completely lost in the memory zone.
i can't bear to think how painful and lonely her final days must have been...
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
the second step is to focus all your anxiety on that point.
hmm, yes. this is a change in the person himself.
let's talk later. go and find hook, she can't have gone too far...
i guess that means i'm capable of completing the thesis all on my own...?
only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. only if you are strong enough can i deliver you to the right destination.
it's easy for luka to get ahead of himself sometimes... but i've never seen him this headstrong. it does make me wonder...
okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
it's been too long, mom... too long.
avoid entering someone's past memories lightly, especially hers.
...to the festival's invitation, to all lies, and the singular truth...
huh, okay... any particular reason?
the shogun does not make mistakes -- she is incapable of doing so. but i, as ei, would like to offer my apologies.
so you're not the guide mister oleg was talking about, seele?
this may be an everyday occurrence for you. but for me, this trip has been quite an occasion.
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
himeko and mister yang and... who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
*sigh* ...why is it always me...
i see... thanks for bringing me up to speed. the clinic has been busy while you were gone. we've treated many people -- soldiers and civilians alike.
so what we're going to do is create inazuma's newest hit novel.
it's okay, i know. you were just following the rules. plus, we really are quite behind schedule with the printing.
if it wasn't for acheron's plan, we might have been trapped in this dream forever.
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
oh, thank you. ah, the sound of being called "director" and the aroma of coffee... feels almost as refreshing as hearing the birds chirping in the morning.
and with that, marcel's motive has now been established...
hah! i had a feeling you'd say that!
since we're all refreshed, ready to head out for the day?
makoto never saw me as a fearless weapon. likewise, i should not regard you as a mere tool.
my bow... but himeko made that for me! you're lying...
hehe, it felt like he learned a lot from me. then again, everyone has a lot to learn from me, hee-hee~
clorinde is right, though. you really are reliable!
all those who sacrificed themselves back then gave their lives fighting for a future... but perhaps the future they were hoping for is not the eternity that i once strove for.
i didn't mean you had to be so formal about it. i need your actions, not your words, hehe.
all the painstaking effort that miss sparkle put into it -- how could i ever miss it?
oh, okay... meet you back here later then. hope you have a good time!
...but deep down, it feels kinda good. is this what slipping into the dark side feels like?
i... i was just ever so slightly concerned about the situation you mentioned. yes. a teensy bit concerned, that's all.
when i clasped musou isshin in my hands, i had the feeling that she was by my side once again.
according to my patient records, there are a few that haven't come for their follow-up visits. it happens from time to time, but never as regularly as this. i'm a bit concerned...
i have my ways. i would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
just you wait and see! i'll show off my skills in the ring and win a match. i'll make both of you proud!
(finally, mister yang approves detective march's theory!)
don't worry. i don't think my parents will be picky about the flowers they get. quick, that florist is looking at us.
the place you are going to is called rivet town. follow the path through the mountains to the north for a bit and you'll arrive there.
i did, yes. you're paying, after all.
but what do we do from here...? i can't just go back and start packing to leave.
however, to wake up everyone in penacony and get them to share the same determination... that would be nearly impossible.
it's getting late. why don't we rest here for a while? i'll tell you some interesting astrology stuff when the stars come out.
as such, the doctor got in touch with his sister in the underworld... claiming that he wanted to support the medical effort below ground.
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
you have returned... but how were you able to get back in? and... how come you have not changed at all in all these years...
tch... to think you'd use such logic...
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
hm, let me guess... fortunately, the next person you ran into was the director.
...for example, "woof woof, woof woof woof woof!"
what a shame i didn't get to see it for myself.
what did we plan to do after this...? i kinda forgot.
haven't you noticed yet? most of our "convincing" ends in a fight.
*sigh* we'll just have to head straight and keep looking.
you intend to travel all over teyvat, and the time has come for the inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city... hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
penacony, the planet of festivities, the universe's biggest and fanciest amusement park awaits!
we can use the building materials that are floating around in the air.
now that fontaine's biggest star has returned to the stage, i figured it's about time the industry enjoyed a breath of fresh air!
shh! it's an old astral express escape signal. do you play cards?
sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. he didn't say why. still, i'll wager it had something to do with him -- he's always tinkering with his devices.
even though i still have a lot of questions, this experience was fruitful enough.
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
it's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. you can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful ei...
and that's how the clash started. now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
"...here lies vache, my brother."
you are the one who organized the plans for this release party. in other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. so please, show some confidence.
(wait, what's going on? why is everyone suspecting me of being a fake? oh, this is bad. if i get exposed here... there'll be no saving the people from the prophecy...)
very good. and murata?
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute...
even though it's been a day, i still break into a sweat when i think about it. our trailblazing expedition almost ended in penacony...
why is this guy suddenly getting all serious with kids?
come on, master diviner -- i'll give you a whirlwind tour of belobog.
when you put it like that, it doesn't actually sound too bad.
she runs a regular q&a column in "that's life" magazine. the people of inazuma absolutely adore her.
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions...
much as i expected. the insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists... you seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
hehe, i know. i just wanted to see how they'd react.
really? then it seems... what kafka taught me was correct.
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
ohh... i've been looking forward to this a lot...
let me think... what spell does lady kitsune teach to the protagonist? ...ah, i've got it!
hey, is that supposed to make us feel better!?
i'll definitely think of a way to make it up to you once i take care of my thesis.
*sigh* i can't remember the last time i got such a polite response.
excellent. ah, i'm looking forward to the next round... i'll await your good news~
time is running out. we need to hurry.
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
let me guess -- time, space... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
no, not at all... look, i am the hydro archon of fontaine, focalors. the god of justice, who is loved and adored by many...
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
regardless of why it's designed like the conductor aboard the astral express, this doll -- is it connected to the case?
but rifthounds attacking the sacred sakura... it brings back bad memories of that terrible disaster...
let's go. it's time for them to learn director aurelie's final thoughts.
and your masters, the kujou clan of the tenryou commission -- they are the ones keeping the truth from reaching the shogun.
at this point, i'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
the interastral peace corporation -- who else? the one whose insignia is pretty much everywhere? that ipc!
it's too dangerous to go alone. get oleg to send someone with you.
tonight i'm going to focus again on clearing my mind... no schoolwork, no assignments, nothing! keeping it completely blank...
we're already at the next scene! you need to convey surprise now, not disappointment...
ah... wha... *laughs*
relax, we got this. right, dan heng?
sure enough, it didn't show up.
(and so luocha has to make a break for it! but where to? lemme have a look at the map... aha, gotcha!)
i'm just here to try something new. there's no fun in reading the same kind of thing over and over again. relax, it's just words on a page, isn't it? what could i misunderstand, really?
is that so... very well. then please speak, witness of teyvat, my accuser and fated opponent.
it doesn't? looks like miss sparkle is more careful than i thought.
oh? it's been a while. did pom-pom call you back?
(furina, you've worked so hard for so, so long. surely it would be okay to put yourself first for once... just this once?)
ahh, it really is robin! to run into her in person here...
if it's only a few games... by all means.
ugh, you're such a nuisance! just what crime are we supposed to have committed again? it better be worth you following us all the way out here!
perhaps, there's something else we can do?
i hesitate to call it a solution, but i might have some information that might help.
wow, they smell so good! they look so crispy and crunchy! i think i'm in love!
oh, the blizzard immunity. shall we drink it? it's your call.
seems like only dan heng has a kind word for my coffee. what do you think? ...well, i've always thought that bitter is better...
if you miss those opportunities in life, you may never get another chance to make up for them. i suppose that's fate.
no, not those... oh, c'mon, i'm not an entomology major and even i know that fireflies aren't anything like what i'm talking about.
since when did i become "miss" march? and where's hook and the others? come on, call them over.
you're right. i can't always be like this... sometimes, it's better to take action than overthink every little thing.
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices... again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
hmm... sounds like you know a lot about him?
whoa! don't sneak up on me like that!
mm, morning... wait, morning!? how is it light out already...
let's find her and tell her about bronya's decision.
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it...
ah sorry, i didn't mean to interrupt you... i just got a little excited. uh, please, go ahead.
i guess even the hardest problems can be solved as long as i'm willing to try...
whenever i made a mistake in an experiment, he'd bite my head off... and then a while later, he'd apologize and comfort me. he was conflicted in that way.
er... have you ever heard of the marechaussee hunters?
this mural is pretty interesting... looks like time hasn't had any effect on it.
this road... are we heading back to the oti mall?
aw, you really care about the little one quite a lot, don't you? hm, i'm a little jealous. i wish my friends were caring like that.
as the countdown began, he entered the tunnel.
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
recite the incantation in your heart, little one. also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head -- a wish, for example.
um... alright. ahem...
i can't forgive him for what he's done. but nor can i say i don't miss him...
so warm...
besides, you'll be at the meeting! if any problems do pop up, you'll have no problem navigating them.
huh? but we haven't even done anything... is her imagination running wild again?
not so fast! last time we were here, that evil madam guardian interrupted us before we'd gotten the most out of our luxury suites... don't you think we should make up for it?
we should proceed with caution. the kujou clan descendant may well be in trouble.
so, it's not that the watchmaker's dream bubble is empty, but rather... the stuff inside ran away?
why don't we go check out that tavern? if the novels i've read are anything to go by, taverns are usually full of information.
hmm, that actually does feels like something he would say...
i knew you would keep your promise, after all... i'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days -- have you managed to get any sleep at all?
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
alright, ask away.
c'est la vie indeed! alas, i am forced to watch on helplessly as a more brave and seasoned adventurer than i swoops in to save the day.
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
she takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near...
someone with a vision should technically be really powerful, right? handling a group of treasure hoarders should be well within my abilities.
thank you for trying to comfort me, but i can't stop myself from thinking that way.
that's the one. actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. it's a spell to help calm the ley line memories.
oh uh, i'm sorry, we were just curious.
another vote for the against pile. thanks for your insight, nat.
to be honest, it was more like stalking than helping, and the process was far from "unnoticed"... but we did escape.
oh... *sobbing*
eh, what's that? it looks like there's something on clockie's face.
i am your past, the everlasting law, the guardian of eternity.
but my friend, kitsune saiguu, reassured me that i had nothing to worry about. she would shoulder the responsibility of protecting inazuma, and mobilize all forces at her disposal to combat the threat.
...but that is what we're here for! that mastery mark is ours!
finding three specific butterflies in a place as large as sumeru city sounds rather improbable...
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
now that i think about it, sending flowers is quite the tradition in my family. mom, dad, vache, and i... whenever something good happened, we sent each other flowers to celebrate.
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
of course not... but you're not planning on doing something like last time, are you?
huh? m--my reasoning?
i just wanna forget about the thesis altogether! ...heh, i'm just kidding. knowing me, i'd only be able to forget about it for a little while.
all in all, he was only here for half a day. i'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation...
mm... it did seem like he had a kind of... tunnel vision. and it sounded like he was holding himself to unreachable standards to attain his dreams.
there's no need to think like that, and no need to keep addressing me as "lady." just "furina" is fine.
fyreflies are such magical creatures, aren't they? they may throw themselves at a flame or suddenly grow old, but every night before that, they will shine brighter than the stars.
as a traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of inazuma. what is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
oh, so it's basically a tea party! sounds great!
i was wondering the same thing. why would they pick on someone half their size?
the angler mystery -- the novel! there's a scene that's identical to this footage.
haha, you don't need a jade abacus to get a feel for sampo...
don't worry! i can't stand by and watch someone be bullied. i have to stand up against injustice, no matter what!
yeah! fyi, we're pretty awesome.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
...he looks like a skilled fighter, the covert kind. he has large palms, yet his fingers are slender and nimble. i reckon he has experience using knives, like a short sword or dagger...
no chance? hey, are you trying to crush my confidence? i'm the kind of girl who performs better when i'm showered with praise, just so you know.
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express...?
it's for mikhail, and for the future of penacony.
(no, furina. you shouldn't be selfish...)
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
haha, well... they do sound like... a brave soul...
but i'm running out of time... oh, what should i do...?
besides, don't you want to chit-chat with the locals now that belobog is full of life again? i know i do!
then the situation is not as complicated as you seem to have made it. after all, i am the one who appoints the tenryou commissioner. the process is quite simple: anyone who can beat me in a duel becomes the new commissioner.
descendant of the kujou clan. your turn.
although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. to me, this says you like to take care of it.
no. she was not created to ever be turned off.
hehehe... i'm sorry. well then... time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. i'm counting on you.
two paths lost their aeons in that war -- the propagation and the order. coincidentally, their downfall is related to a certain aeon...
i'm in today. but that is not an excuse for misbehavior.
i am the only one in all of inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
...this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
this place is... complicated. it's quite unlike the tea house in your memories.
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
...despicable. my "criminal activity" senses are tingling.
don't worry. such a crude approach violates my aesthetics of memory, so once you leave my sight, you'll be able to remember everything again. and also...
no, i'm not getting any flashbacks. please -- do i look xianzhouish to you? you must be thinking of dan heng.
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
look! this place is breathtaking, isn't it?
wait, this part on the last page sounds strangely familiar...
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
this is mister jiaoqiu, the healer working for the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
alright, i won't disturb you two any longer. bye-bye, now.
ugh... but we haven't done anything wrong!
ugh -- can't find a way to break their formation!
so they just jumped inside that tv...
you're awake, lazy bug. looks like you had a nice dream.
ah, this should be it, right? i'll turn it off -- that should restore the ley lines in the area to normal.
okay, so get this: there's this creepy laboratory in our institute where strange things happen.
no, not at all. don't be so nervous, i'm just here to look around.
did you see that? there's something on the monster's back.
hand them to sara. she can examine them for herself.
message not sent? why not?
as long as the ley lines flow, the relentless erosion of time will never stop.
uh... is this right?
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
also, we're not your friends. why should we care if a stellaron hunter is innocent, hmm~?
huh? no, no no no, there's no need... it's so embarrassing...
vache spent his life looking for ways to push past the limits of the human body... but he met a bitter end.
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
wait a minute, i'm sorry, but are you... the...?
readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. if we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
hang on, i'm still struggling to understand this. i need you to explain it again...
ooh, that's a good one, i like it!
i have some words to share with you, though they were spoken to me by miss acheron. she said that "the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen..."
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
humans' yearning for sweet illusions borders on obsession, leading them to subconsciously resist... the harsh reality.
...miss acheron's words speak sense. regardless, we have to reach that flat surface hanging overhead. and we're not scaling the pillar, of course.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
really? you jumped just now -- it was really sudden, too.
but you and the gang put on the best show i've seen so far, twirly-whirly! that was a real blast, i loved it!
i don't know if the family only lost their belongings in the end, or if something worse happened to them.
#uh, you sure are getting better at rolling with the situation, paimon. hmm, i do wish to see how skilled {nickname} really is with a kamera.
hey, check it out. the bases of these stone lanterns are different...
my pom-pom toy... not a bad idea! that's kinda like bringing the conductor on vacay with me. ah, but i think it's too big to stuff in the case...
my take on this might surprise you.
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
but if we try to fight the guards right now...
exactly what it means: down.
we're deep inside the fragmentum... there could be hidden dangers lying in wait.
safe to say, were it not for my previous experiences in combat, my skills would not have been up to the challenge. i would most certainly have been defeated.
last time you entered the plane of euthymia, it was in front of the statue of the omnipresent god, correct?
think about it, dan heng's the one managing the archives -- he'll already be clued in to our next destination. himeko and welt know already, of course... so it's just me and you in the dark!
*sigh* i knew this wouldn't be simple...
...through patting yourself on the back!?
allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
...he was my family, and someone i used to look up to.
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
ah... her? how is this possible?
is this all the water we're getting?
haha... i was just joking. i've been waiting for you.
huh? looks like the little guy's scared...
it wouldn't be possible with a normal pathstrider.
individual ambition is inherently incompatible with eternity.
even if i don't know drunken swordplay, i've got other tricks up my sleeve!
dan heng's speculations are usually right on the money. but even if we've guessed right, we can't go home now.
ahaha! yes, but don't get too excited now... my dear believers and spectators alike tend to get quite rowdy, and despite the noise, i've come to tolerate all their ruckus.
later, this puppet wandered inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until... the fatui took an interest in him.
thank you so much! i'll try my best to contribute, too. i don't want to be a burden to you guys.
hahaha! just a moment, please. i do hope you know how preposterous you sound at the moment.
but what if the bigger war comes to pass? what then?
my original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. but then i ran into miss hu tao and mister zhongli, and well, you know the rest. i suppose it was meant to be.
now, kamisato ayato and the yashiro commission are neutral parties, so i have no right to give orders to the shuumatsuban.
if i get another chance, i'll practice even harder and won't ever lose again!
i suggest that you act just before sunrise, while most people are tired and resting. you may find some important leads.
why don't we flip the question and start by asking who couldn't be the murderer? after all, there are only three suspects, so elimination could be a valid method.
in the dark of shadow, our heroes seek to find, where creatures born of evil, weave their grand design.
i knew we could rely on you!
it's really you. i knew i didn't get the wrong person.
it would seem that there has been a misunderstanding. to be clear, the raising of both hands is not always an indication of surrender...
hook, you look very happy. did something good happen?
traveler, paimon, i really appreciate all your help!
aw, that's so kind of you! you just made a loyal customer out of me.
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
you're awesome, master yunli!
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous... *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
i thought so too. it's most likely some rule of penacony's, or the family's.
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
haha, look at you all, you've already gotten really close.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
(i think she actually really enjoys it...)
we can get in now, right? hehe, svarog's certification system is no match for us!
let me think... oh, i know!
it'd be pretty awesome if that actually happened.
you've done enough. treating the injured is doctor's work.
are you still... continuing down this path? this is a rare opportunity. leaving here... will also mean leaving the truth.
huh!? would miss topaz stoop so low? i can't believe she'd be that desperate...
hmm... i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
many things have changed now that inazuma is at peace. however... it seems that some people continue to fear the "divine light" just as before.
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
that tablet recorded the lives of some fascinating people. for example, this marechaussee hunter called "este"...
huh? wh--what do you mean?
if you're interested, you can go to the beach and give it a try.
use of force here is strictly forbidden. before you proceed, which of you would like to face criminal charges for dishonoring the shogun, hmm?
hehe, since you are willing to admit that, i suppose that means we can still be friends?
actually, i have no idea...
to be honest, i haven't slept a wink for days... just thinking about the awful state of my thesis keeps me up at night.
yeah, it might be better to keep a low profile. as long as we're helping people, it doesn't matter who we are or what we're called.
hehe, that seems rather fitting, considering that we are dealing with the spirits of the deceased here.
fortunately, we were able to avoid the worst-case scenario thanks to the help of heroic individuals such as yourselves.
who knows if it'll happen this time... i can't put all my eggs in one basket.
hey, look at all these chips scattered everywhere...
that's why you have to develop your talent pool -- otherwise everything falls apart when you go on vacation...
miss march took me to her room just now. it was quite cozy. i liked it very much.
why is that surprising? playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and i was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
...selling fake medicine with false kindness. you should have expected trouble to find you sooner or later.
what does it feel like? like all your worries have been swept away?
...or, perhaps you might consider a suggestion.
...this place doesn't seem to have changed much from what i remember.
but i preferred the character design of the deputy sheriff. can it come back?
actually, no -- forget that. far more trouble than it's worth.
do you remember the invite that the express received?
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
(wait... so, as long as you pass the check, you can pretty much do anything, and it won't be seen as absurd?)
oh, um, please wait! ah, there it goes...
thank you for your assistance, miss alley. by the way... is miss robin doing fine? we are looking forward to her performance.
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
ah, hello little ones. i take it you have received my commission, hmm?
mmm, what is it then... my answer is "bugs." is that right?
a memory zone of this level is mere child's play to a memokeeper. come on. let's head out through the front door.
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
do make the most of your trip here, won't you? quite a lot has changed.
but when there are valid grounds, i will not only judge travelers from abroad...
hey, are you on her side? i just wanted to remind her not to break her promise, that's all.
c--could it fail?
oh, uh...
ah no, that makes me sound suspicious... hold on, do i really look that shady?
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something... and that'd just be too sad.
of course, as soon as she got her award, she went straight back to her old self.
(she's probably trying to tell us to speed this up. we need to hurry up so we can address the sorcerer problem...)
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
oh? you're earlier than i expected...
huh!? oh, um... i'm not sure i'll have enough energy for that...
still, you needn't worry. he won't escape. you'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
looks like nothing can be found here.
drat... we're caught right away.
when the childrens' parents are away in the mines, the clinic becomes a kind of nursery... haha, to be fair, it's me who invites them. perhaps i need them more than they need me.
brother... where are you? what happened...?
she is your sister, after all.
i mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. you don't need to look after me...
where's the input interface? ah, found it...
ah... that line actually makes me a bit nervous...
are you yinshu, the shopkeeper at spare time book shop? there's something we want to talk to you about.
ah, it's the antimatter legion! so these crazy jerks made it all the way here... watch this!
by true-to-life, you mean... the director's sudden disappearance?
does that mean he wants to fight us during the charmony festival?
hey, that's not fair! my eyes are peeled this time -- i'll make a run for it the second things go wrong.
however, her unpredictable and varying sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so i have to make every second count.
we did it! it's open! quick, let's go, i think i heard footsteps!
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
his thinking is very spontaneous... is this typical of artists?
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up...
o--oh, so there's still hope after all? goodness, you frightened me -- you spoke so much, and with so much certainty...
hah! see, they weren't brave enough to follow us! freedom!
...how come you just jumped out on your own, little fella? isn't your module thingy broken?
(is this where you introduce your character to everyone? it sounds like they've done this dozens of times.)
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
oh, we haven't seen serval since we got back! let's head to the workshop.
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
ah, yes: "true love cannot be controlled by external forces"... little layla's belief is a classic one.
please come this way. let me show you something interesting.
...so this is the certification mark?
(oh no... judging by the atmosphere, clorinde and navia are probably thinking something similar. the mood just got super awkward all of a sudden...)
did you now? well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy... and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
heh, little misha... or should i call him the watchmaker?
besides, none of these trials were the one that i'm looking forward to the most...
well... *sigh* i guess i have to keep looking up as much info as possible. i shouldn't give up now.
a loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. she is worthy to be called a hero. with an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the kujou clan is assured.
i... think we should leave this matter to the belobogians... don't you agree?
as guuji of the grand narukami shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. only then am i capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
...i'm just speculating. in any case, we have to be careful when handling aventurine. he's skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. also...
(hah, it's quite amusing to watch how all of this is playing out. a little nudge in the right direction and things will become much more dramatic...)
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
she brought her brother underground and entrusted him with her clinic and laboratory...
i'm glad we're on the same page. we can't just let this kid do whatever she wants.
...yes, when the dust settles, i'll just think of a way to recall it in the memory zone.
this place feels kinda... yeah, a lot like where i live. cozy and familiar.
perhaps she's around here somewhere? shouldn't we take a look?
it sure is... *sigh* let's press on and see what awaits.
um, anyway, now that the organizer and the sponsor have both been arrested, what should we do about the fungi and this tournament?
okay, let's start by looking at the hint it left us. it should be on the second page.
huh, what do you mean?
seriously, i've never seen the luofu so lively before.
i never expected the corporation to know anything about aether copying tech! i thought that was something only punklordian hackers could handle.
yeah, now that we've got a plan, there's no point in waiting. the longer this drags on, the worse it will be for everybody.
whew... give me a second to wrap my head around all of this...
...furuyama? is that you?
the strategic investment department comprises the ipc's most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.
i had no idea there was still a student inside. i had no choice but to put him to sleep.
i know, right? it's a dream that's loving and forgiving to everyone, just like the family.
i know. you can't wait to join the finals of the belobog representative qualifiers. but gepard isn't a pushover either.
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
speaking of solutions... are they repairing that giant robot -- the one we fought against? i remember you took control of it and helped us defeat cocolia!
what happens next is going to blow your mind...
there there... chin up, pom-pom! don't be sad. don't cry...
(a pawnshop that grants wishes... is there really a place like that on this ship?)
to make this tea party even more lively, i've invited someone else to join us today...
i should've been wary of him sooner... sorry. regardless, the family must be hiding something -- something about the truth behind the dreamscape...
alright, i've written down all the possible questions that i think the advisers might ask. next, i'll put together a few words of encouragement for her.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
traveling to other worlds is all that anyone seems be writing about these days. huh, goodness knows what they find so disappointing about their own world.
but where did i put it...
...it sounds dangerous, but what i want you to do is actually very simple. investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out what exactly they're up to.
hey! is it trying to pull a charged attack?
great! fluffy pillows here we come!
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity... based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
chasing and waiting -- maybe that's what life's all about...
but the memory zone up ahead... appears to be severely twisted. be careful, everyone.
but that's impossible. it's always avoiding me and keeping me in the dark... and that won't change, even if you're around.
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are... learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
yes. more precisely, it's right below.
...this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
come on, i've told you my story -- now it's your turn. shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
i used to have a much wider range of choices when it came to food, but now, i'm finding that simple, traditional home cooking can be quite delicious too.
usually, i'm pretty picky about whether the place has any pesky bugs flying around...
you'll have to wait for us to finish checking in first.
refund! immediately!
master yunli has a very freestyle approach to teaching. the thing she always says to me is: "you just feel it!" maybe that's what they call experiential guidance?
for us to meet now is premature. nevertheless, you set foot on these islands at precisely the right moment.
hmm? hmph! a--are you not afraid? might i remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
ah, that's right. as a small token of compensation for playing that little trick on you with the empty light cone, i will gift you with some words -- they hold great significance to me...
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes"... i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
anyway, let's go take a look!
though blind, furuyama is unparalleled in his ability to appraise tea. he brews some of the very finest tea in all of inazuma.
thank you so much. i've made up my mind not to use astrology for this. i think i'll just try my luck in the city.
it came as a surprise indeed to learn that not only did you accept those conditions, you also made your own demands. your courage has won my respect.
what's going on? why is he chatting with these bugs?
now we just have to wait for the official news. i hope bronya doesn't keep us too long.
sure. you can come back once you've reviewed the basics of film composition and feel ready.
although... it felt like she was looking through me. as in, i know she was speaking to us, but it seemed like her gaze was fixed on something far away...
i know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but penacony is actually in danger right now... we have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
oh, you haven't heard? "lesser lord kusanali" is the deity in whom the people of sumeru place their faith. it's their chosen term of endearment for her.
such is the herta company culture...
that you have piqued her interest. perhaps it's because... she has never seen an individual who is so unpredictable in the face of eternity.
hehe... now you're following me.
thus, the current situation is that our fatui antagonist is still at large, has the two rogue commissions wrapped around their finger, and is distributing delusions from the shadows...
who could it be...? going to all this effort just to meet us?
so much energy... seriously, what's her secret?
i trust that nobody would object to the ending of the story being based on aurelie's true feelings?
ugh, whyyy... i still wasn't able to fall asleep yet... can't i just try a little longer? *groan*
mister gallagher seems to be getting at something.
...what!? that run-of-the-mill, huh?
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
heh, it looks like we're finally about to set off. there are countless gleaming memories out there waiting for us... why don't we just leave it at that for now?
finally, the child offered some fried tofu to thank me for accompanying her, then left with her little fox friend.
since you've made it yourself, i guess having a little taste is the least i can do, haha...
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
hmm... oh, i'm sorry, i got distracted there. where were we?
*sigh* please stop bringing that up. let's just say that landings and crowds don't mix.
(uh... i don't think that's the kind of question we're supposed to ask...)
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
you... you would draw your blade against a god?
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
hehe, what an adorable little girl. well, that settles it. aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
this power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
however, i tend to get really nervous when my advisers look at me, and i end up completely forgetting what i planned to say...
...but what about the "furnace" his master mentioned?
the truth does not lie. neither do memories.
whoa... she sounds like a big deal.
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around...
the express is... melting?
do you mean... you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
(uh-oh! his only escape is...)
we were just about to discuss the boards over here. they're related to our little helpers' tasks, so i'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
the cart is about to depart!
yeah, i've lost count of all the dolls i've made. still, hook clearly likes this one a lot.
i said relax, there's no need to go treading on eggshells. do you really think the eternity i pursue is something that can be shaken by dango and milk?
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
unyielding resolve in the face of death...
good. in that case, with regard to the matter at hand, let's vote to decide our next move.
the kujou clan's honor was forged with courage, tempered with integrity, and shines beyond life and death
hoo-wee! we may be new to the xianzhou, but we're already investigating the mysterious disappearance of luocha...
ah, proof that i boarded the express. the conductor gave me this.
and it's behind a gate. what are the odds...
i don't believe anybody could be more committed to bringing this story to life on the stage than they are now.
let's go. the venue for this meeting is in the kanjou commission headquarters up there. the view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
...we don't need another amnesiac on this train...
eventually, i managed to return with a few adventurers i ran into along the way.
miss tingyun... is a lord ravager of the antimatter legion!? but-- how can that be?
after that... i will abolish the sakoku decree.
then what are we waiting for? let's go.
no need. "she" is calling me. the time has come.
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand... anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
and then there's the preparation for my thesis defense... i'll need to mentally prepare.
twenty years ago, huh... i still remember the gardes leaving all kinds of witness reports about her on neuvillette's desk.
thank you, knight of beauty! we don't have much time left... may we meet again.
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends... even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
look, miss himeko: i brought the kid back as promised.
you scared me! wh--where... are you now?
hey, none of that counted just now. let's start over! ready? three, two, one... go!
hope the seelie's clue wasn't also torn to shreds by avidya leopards...
seriously, think about it, it's aether copying! i've only ever heard of that stellaron hunter girl using this kind of tech.
huh!? hehe... i--i've never done it before! dan heng, you do it!
alright. deoteria, is it? how is your son's illness?
look up there... if we can push that thing down, do you think that would do the trick?
i see. well, when you put it that way... looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
wait... do you plan on slipping skott a laxative?
hang in there, twirly! you can still do this!
hold on, let us explain! we're not--
uh-huh! i... let's just leave it here for a while... and it'll be alright, right?
of course you should! why wouldn't you?
okay, i should get started on those notes. if there's anything you're curious about, you may go ahead and ask now. i can answer you as i write! i'm used to multi-tasking.
anyway. now that i have been defeated by you and your plan, i will honor your wish to abolish the vision hunt decree.
only by achieving victory in this battle can we secure a future for penacony. and only then, my third and final death... won't come true in the most terrible form.
too chicken? i was giving you the chance to back out! but you're actually insulting me now, you cheeky...
still, you did end up victorious. i gather congratulations are in order.
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
...but i think i failed. maybe... there are other things that you guys do?
...uhm, nevermind. let's hurry over to the next stage.
i'm fine... just a little light-headed is all...
yeah, i did say that, but this is all happening so quickly, don't you think?
it is the cradle of my vitality, and the meaning of my birth. and for the longest time, it was... how i should have looked to the rest of the world.
you poor thing! i'll go check the lunar calendar -- today might be unlucky.
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
i didn't understand at the time. how can we say that we are maintaining eternity when things are constantly moving forward and evolving?
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
don't worry, seele. like i said, it was just the exhaustion. svarog was deliberately holding back.
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm... wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
you...! every time an important moment arrives, you hesitate.
uh, ahem, miss hu tao...
then tell me, which of the ipc's achievements can you personally take credit for?
i... get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
please, that's how those heroes in the immersia show their respect...
you're right! those roots never grew back!
ha~ now that battle was really intense! those puzzles were such a blast, too -- i think i'm hooked!
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
yes, well, sumeru is the land of the god of wisdom, where the quest for wisdom and knowledge is never-ending.
*sigh* it feels nice to get tingyun's gifts to the right people.
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
boring... isn't there anything else more interesting to do?
of course, it'd be even better if we could unravel the mystery of your past along the way!
yeah. i'd be lying if i said i wasn't scared of coming back here.
not at all. you don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. all you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
to solve the mystery of the watchmaker, it is crucial to get the ipc's intel. the path ahead is fraught with danger... but what's trailblazing without a little danger?
things are getting more amusing by the second.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
seriously, trying to save face in front of kids? *sigh*
huh? is this a broadcast?
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
(come to think of it, she disappeared after mentioning that she was going to meet with the genius society. i wonder how things turned out for her.)
yay! mister yang is the best!
looks like you've forgotten -- there is a memokeeper girl in front of the express' shattered mirror.
hehe... *pretend yawn* anyone else sleepy...?
exactly! it's time for the crew to save the world once more!
i was perfectly calm until she volunteered to help...
...like countless fireflies chasing the fire.
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
don't sweat it -- leave them to us.
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
ah, i know what this is! it's an advertisement for a home-use object finder.
thanks. let's go!
so if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. relax, if i need your assistance, i won't hesitate to ask.
when you came to talk with me earlier, i jumped right to explaining my position, and said some strongly worded things.
the memory zone is constantly shifting its form. looks like we'll have to think of a way... to walk on the ceiling.
but, this door is blocking our way in... huh, it almost looks like it's been here for quite some time. i've got to hand it to the tabletop troupe. they really went all-out with the props...
it is as if we have returned to the moment when the laws of eternity were first established. your will today is as strong as it was back then.
but... we still don't have any weapons in hand...
i didn't know he had leftover reagents in rivet town. i was shocked when you told me.
natasha! oleg! hope you didn't have to wait too long.
her final words are... ... ...i'll let you read them for yourselves.
it's important to learn to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. you might discover a new interest if you just give it a try.
wait... no way...
hmm, makes sense... guess we better head over to serval's workshop then?
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection... why would they come after me?
but i don't even wanna become an adorable ice cube floating around in space again!
however, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well...
right? i don't think it's fair for you to carry the weight alone. why not discuss it with others first?
"self-reflection is a wonderful quality to possess, but you'll only end up hurting yourself if you overdo it."
pfft! as if anyone wants your junkyard scrap mechs!
decades...? but i'll be an old lady by then... no, no.
judging by the results, at least, i daresay i struck a good deal. hehehe.
unfortunately, the semifinals is where my journey ended. the reason being...
are you saying... you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?
it's all happened so quickly i can only make conjecture. after leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. i hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
i mean, when yunli swung that massive sword, she just casually blocked her attack with ease...
if you get hit by the musou no hitotachi, that's it. it's game over. i would get training if i were you.
leave it to me. i've watched you rehearse so many times that i've learned clio's part by heart.
wait a minute, we're not done here! you dragged us to the underground -- so what's the big idea?
not bad. i suppose this is a step forward for you. but i'm afraid...
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
seems like the first day of our trailblazing expeditions is always pretty eventful, huh dan heng.
what about all the unresolved emotions of the parties involved? what happens to them?
i'm just happy i didn't get in your way during the fight...
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
you left something behind? hurry up and go get it, i'll wait here for you!
ah, yeah, yes, that's exactly right! please keep it a secret for me.
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
i understand your anger, but as your doctor, i ask you to trust my judgment.
but, i can tell you one thing: my favor towards you stems from a more profound reason.
why was this tv... dumped on the side of the road?
uh, ahem, i mean... what can he do exactly? are we gonna set him loose on kafka?
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
five hundred years ago, humanity proved their strength in battle.
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
hehe, i won't be modest this time. my skills have improved by leaps and bounds!
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
so you just happened to be going the same way... did you see what the outworlder was doing?
let's go! i can't wait to finally get back above ground!
why do people choose to sleep? i think...
could there be other things similar to what yanming got? we should take a look.
as a fox envoy, i have an excellent memory. i recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
hmm... given that i'd like to focus on the story, i suppose i should pick "easy mode." i'd feel bad if i brought the team down by failing my checks...
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
face it head-on? wh--what should i do? do you really think i can...?
even if we'd done nothing at all, shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
i'm feeling nervous, but excited at the same time!
gorou, you are not only patient but also very beautiful. why don't you come and help us? i'll prepare a tailor-made outfit, just for you.
seventeen rounds of interviews and these are the best people they can find? what a joke.
oh stop, you're making me all flustered. although... hehe, not in a bad way.
let me be honest... do you really think you have what it takes to shoot a film?
hahaha, oh, the looks on your faces right now. too perfect. hahaha.
perhaps... you are right.
wait... i wrote that! that's a story i made up about my past!
mm-hmm, i'm afraid the conditions underground are terrible. people get sick easily here, and i'm the only doctor.
hmmm... honest kid. i know where you are, miss sparkle.
uh, did i say something wrong again?
...and if you run into any trouble, you can try asking for wildfire.
...yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
anyway, the opinion of the clinic is that none of you have come to harm.
wh--what is this? ...it's scary!
himeko... i still don't get it. why were you so sure that misha had a connection with this dream bubble?
compared to the aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of aeons and the paths.
that was a close one... but we made it.
we'll also need to make some immediate adjustments to the lighting, props, and costumes.
ippei? is that someone from the tenryou commission?
but could you try to spice it up a bit? tell it as if it were a best-seller from yae publishing house.
serval, you seem to know more about aether spirits than us -- can you tell us what's up with this little guy?
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me... let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
i imagine that an item as delicious as this dango milk must sell exceptionally well, no?
(ayaka's performance was amazing... have i discovered an acting prodigy?)
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
wait a minute, now i'm a little confused. are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
it would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
history fictionologist? so what everything you told us was made up?
how are things in poisson now? any better?
gah, time's ticking! just listen to the grown-ups!
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh... inconvenient situation.
yes. what is making her so nervous?
in your dreams! this is genius detective march seventh's case -- i should be the one paying...
and that's when they sent topaz over to collect the debt...
then i'm on board! thank you for your kindness, general huaiyan.
so, are we to just abandon the notion of progress... for the sake of wishful thinking?
as inazuma's god, it is high time i honored their wishes.
isn't this lamp a little too obvious? it's like it's just begging us to be lit...
i've already prepared seats for you. come, sit beside me.
ooh... so many options. i'm seeing stars already.
thank you so much, masters. oh, wait, does this mean our training is only officially starting right now?
penacony's really thronging with talent... i hope we make it in time.
i see. well, it wouldn't be of any help if i practiced for her, but i'll leave some notes that should come in handy.
yes... sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
let's go. once this stage play concludes... it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
the true story is anyone's guess, but everyone aspires to emulate his success and be the next watchmaker!
hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
something is actively attempting to cover up all the clues without my knowing.
this memory zone... is overly twisted. i have to use inelegant methods, so you two... please give me a little time...
huh? you can tell?
(from the look of things... could the prime minister be the evil sorcerer? or... could both the king and the prime minister have fallen under the evil sorcerer's control?)
personally, i think the idea of things staying the same forever is quite beautiful. *sigh* but alas, that is simply not the way the world works.
she also appears to be standing right behind you.
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle... i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
so, pitch-dark hook the great, you can tell us now, right?
well, yeah, but she'll be really disappointed...
hehe, good. saves me from having to explain everything again.
i wouldn't have put it past them to try and nab that stellaron from inside you.
not only that, urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," to become the most popular in inazuma.
it seems like someone has been awaiting us. ready to step into the spotlight now?
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
i'm at your service. i will not disappoint.
i'm still the same furina you knew, right? the one that you loved? shouldn't you want to believe in me?
no matter how much damage we do, it just heals itself... not fair!
wh--who are you? why do you look exactly like me?
you said you were gonna help me, didn't you? why are you holding out on me now?
"a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. if we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
here we are, everwinter monument! photo time!
that said, if you continue down this path and find that it leads somewhere quite different from what you had hoped... what will become of that iron-clad determination then? i look forward to finding out.
hey, even i can say things that sound profound and mysterious!
mm-hmm. catching up with an old friend i hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.
there's no end to this. let me try.
...but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
yay, we did it! can't see the smoke anymore.
have you noticed? these landscapes seem quite distinct from that of penacony's in your dream, yet strikingly similar to the dreamscape described by miss black swan.
what's gotten into you? come on, sit yourselves down.
there's no time. i'll just have to break the rules and use some methods to help you phase through the memory zone.
but, how we can get him to do that... showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
in that case, it's unanimous.
your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. something that shines in unison with fate itself.
good... i'm so glad you're all okay.
but your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
you want to go back? unfortunately, human consciousness always gravitates toward reality. now that you've seen the flaw in the dream, there is no turning back.
hehe, don't be nervous. just follow your heart's desire.
alright, please come with me.
have you all considered this? perhaps your destination could be a world that even the renowned akivili never reached...
i was wondering... if this troupe is so important to all of you, why does it have to disband?
are we... both in control of this hanu character?
shouldn't this be expected of a memokeeper?
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan...
(*sigh* fine, i'll be me. you guys will have to imagine his lines instead.)
*sigh* being too popular can be such a hassle. who knew the people would adore me so much?
prepare for battle. looks like we'll have to fight again.
hey, come on now, seele's got a sharp tongue but a soft heart. she didn't mean anything.
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
well, not exactly...
do you wish to know the truth about the shooting stars at night? haha, they are but fleeting moments of luminosity. uh, you used to be one of them? are you a tengu warrior?
whew, i'm getting sleepy myself. see you tomorrow. remember to wake me up on time...
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
sounds like an amazing treasure!
i suppose any progress is a step in the right direction. let's go.
hmm... memokeepers should probably think of a better way to show up.
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces... let's hurry back.
not only have you stopped paying attention to the world, but you have stopped paying attention to yourself.
(book circulation is strictly regulated and there is a log of anyone who checks out a book.)
you saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. after leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
(i think she's enjoying herself...)
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
i'll go ahead and eliminate that incorrect answer for you. so, what is the fatal flaw?
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...
once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
hmm... i'm feeling calmer now... okay, let's go look for more leads nearby.
alright. goodbye then, urakusai.
here we go again... but no big deal, we're pretty handy with this bazooka now.
as in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
the complex locality of this world has been... affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
(ahem... what's wrong with a quick route, mister yang?)
*yawn* coming, coming... seriously, who's knocking before afternoon tea...
hmm... i had a bunch of friends back then, and we would go pick wild berries in the woods.
hmm, i just hope that doesn't affect your performance today!
or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? who knows, maybe i'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
the tag on the tie reads "only for imperial master lefton"... seems like it's one of miss sparkle's personal belongings.
suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool... and it seems like a stunt they'd pull...
i wasn't scared by anything... but on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
hah, how can you put up your best fight without a doctor on the battlefield?
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
ugh... it feels like mister giovanni has been stringing us along the whole time!
whoa! so that's a xianzhou ship? it looks even bigger than jarilo-vi!
no! that end won't come to pass while we're around!
if we had a little more time, i could have even convinced her i was xipe the harmony.
wow, miss topaz, you're really young for an ipc executive! that's impressive!
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work...)
navigators really do have their plates full, huh? seems like it's just you and me this time.
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver... i just want to get there in one piece.
yeah... i can tell people are watching me.
uh... well, what about the pay?
dear mighty god of wisdom, i've been studying late into the night for days on end, please let me pass this exam! please, please... zzz...
it's fine. i was the one who brought it up.
oh, come on! it doesn't matter if she's talking about the old or new generation, we're all still a part of the astral express family!
dan heng! bronya just sent all of us a message. did you see it yet?
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
hide-and-seek update... astral express crew -- two, the moles -- zero!
it's a grassroots organization. think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
by the way... i heard that you had a duel before the throne, with a fatui harbinger no less. courageous and astute -- i must say, i am most impressed.
you could take the view that whatever i say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the ley lines.
defense or offense, we need to pick one and go all in.
not much. as before, i can see the way forward, yet there are still contradictions.
hey, lay off, alright! my bluff is hanging from a thread here.
i've been searching for quite a while now, but i haven't seen any sign of the swiftflies yet.
...but then wait, where does bullying the owner of the sleepless earl fit in with all of this?
miko... the people of inazuma are afraid of me...
spray can? that's... rough.
the paper looks familiar... can i open it?
that when that moment arrives for us to make a choice, the answer to our end will already be within our hearts
...you will see me appear once again as i have done today -- only next time, my blade will show no mercy.
memory is like the deep blue sea. but if you try to catch two fish with one cast... you might not be satisfied with your catch.
what a heavy gate... okay, watch this!
"mirror-me"... wh--what do you wish to say?
it's settled then. my, look at the time. i have to meet with my editors, so i must be going now.
i've got no idea what happened there, either. but hey, it worked pretty well, didn't it?
alright, check out this move!
so, for the name... do i fill it out with the name of my character?
huh...!? isn't svarog wildfire's sworn enemy?
(i never imagined that it would hurt so much...)
holy moly, it's the grand prize... today must be your lucky day!
clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
hmm, maybe some of your neural circuitry is less intact than i thought...
i didn't expect to meet you here. we were just talking about tails...
take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
they... set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
naturally, take your time.
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here...
little miss pink... what's that supposed to mean!?
oh, yeah! fyxestroll garden! it's famous for supernatural stuff, with those mischievous heliobi floating around! it's pretty fascinating!
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans...)
but, so what? i still think he was a nice guy, even if he was a bit weird...
actually... i hope i don't have to fight you guys in the later stages, either...
go on, twirly-whirly. be a good fungus now, and do everything that haniyyah says...
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. time for anti-raiden shogun training phase two.
good morning! is work going well today, master diviner?
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals... at least, it was at the time of recording.
don't push yourself too hard! just leave if you can't handle it!
"the express has lots of express friends, and it wants to find them and play together."
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
i was only joking, hook. junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. but you must make one promise to me...
even the people who usually criticize me voted for me this time... so i feel like i have to live up to their expectations somehow...
this stool is a piece of evidence, right?
(oh, so this is just part of the script... phew... then i can probably relax.)
uhm... don't, you're freaking me out...
i'm making early preparations for what is to come.
i can't see anything fishy... did kafka lay a trap for us? let's get diting to investigate.
you're right... but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
they must be... erebus? strange, i didn't notice when i sewed them on...
that lacks a sense of propriety! i'm not just writing a letter. i'm writing a handwritten letter! i've gotta show them i'm really on the xianzhou!
hehe, oh i see! well, how wonderfully comedic, to have your own counterattack only to come back and wound you!
there seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. to put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
it sounds... like a flawless theory...
as much as i'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, i suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
right on! but you can say whatever you like -- a good adventure shouldn't be full of rules and regulations!
so he really did have a breakthrough in the snow plains...
i never knew the fateometer even determines the amount of damage you inflict... if you get unlucky, isn't it just game over right then and there?
my, someone rather discerning fitted out this shrine.
so, if i were to take on that ipc guy now, what would you say are my chances?
i know... but it's still a shame, don't you think?
you'd better go to the bathroom...
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration... what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later...
(this isn't working.)
you're heading back to the store, right? let's walk and talk. i'll tell you all about it on the way.
i'm okay, my mind just decided to stray elsewhere for a moment. give me a second to gather myself... oh, is this the celestial globe that i needed to borrow?
besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
but a will that cannot be eroded has no way to embrace the future.
tea parties are a must for the well-mannered. if you'd like to learn the proper etiquette, i'd be happy to teach you.
huh? why the adventurers' guild?
...i don't know exactly how to describe it. it's like he's smiling on the outside, but there's no joy inside. only sorrow.
you have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
during the hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the grand narukami shrine. having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
i... i understand. it's only right to return the favors i receive!
huh? ever-hunt plains? uh... yeah, sure! big sis will take you there.
entropy loss syndrome. have you heard of this term?
i'm gonna miss you twirly-whirly... take good care of my best shroom-buddy.
oh, hello. miko told me about the test of courage event taking place here. i thought i would come and have a look.
this is one problem that even the musou no hitotachi will not be able to solve.
by the way, miko mentioned that she founded something called the yae publishing house to sell some sort of... light novels.
let me get some aideen tokens for you. with those, you'll be able to try any of the attractions here that you fancy.
(y'know, just a little dramatic effect...)
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
huh. i wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
neverwinter workshop... hey! didn't gepard say there'd be a show here?
huh, you must've had some miserable jobs.
the fungi have existed for a long time. no one knows what the ecological implications for the rainforest would be if they all got killed off suddenly.
as the raiden shogun they revere, i should not be the one to hold them back.
and what's more... the fragmentum corrosion has begun to reach us down here, too...
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
what she really wanted to say was this: "how soon do you think you could open a branch in the plane of euthymia?"
hey, we meet again, sleepy head.
wait... it's not an enemy! it's my shroom buddy!
alright, thank you all. i can do this!
that's totally giving up... come back here!
but we haven't heard anything about the watchmaker having descendants, and the name "mikhail" is not rare. perhaps it's merely a coincidence.
if cocolia threatens us by taking bronya hostage...
a touching story, a magnificent venue, and last but not least, a passionate and dedicated cast!
uh, thank you... thank you so much. i don't even know how to show you my gratitude.
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
yeah, perhaps. soulglad is a classic in penacony, and it'd be strange for a bar not to have it.
let's get going, to the interastral tournament festival venue!
vache... it's been so many years. are you still alone in the blizzard...?
now then, let us be re-introduced!
just open your eyes! surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? we've had nothing but critical acclaim!
i'm really sorry.
you mean... leave the plane of euthymia?
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
the will i carry within me will never be eroded nor destroyed.
sinking? you mean... the dreamscape is collapsing?
(clorinde must have broke character for a second!)
phones and cameras capture great beauty, but it never compares to what we see with our own eyes.
(so, he's also using his real name... or wait, was that the name of his character from the very beginning...?)
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors... but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
that sounds like... both buttons can do the exact same thing?
(it seems i've turned them around. best follow this flow and restart my accession speech...)
i know, right? isn't he adorable?
this experience is a case in point. i feel like i've learned a lot, and it has already been well worth the price of admission.
yes, i agree! as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
i'm seriously scared they might start moving... let's just leave, please!
...mister gallagher, you even know my name?
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
the moment you stepped into the memory zone, reality's building structures lost all meaning. i can sense that she is in a faraway place right now.
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
i can't deny that i am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his vision, but i rather think the shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him... okay, fine. i'll give it some more thought.
alright, it's like this. all we need to do is load the robot onto the mine cart...
fine, fine, i suppose haste is warranted. lead the way!
oh, how cold. i saved your skin, didn't i? surely you could at least humor me by engaging in some small talk first?
uh? he didn't send you all here?
i've taken care of your wounds. i'm running short on medical supplies these days though, so behave yourselves and stay away from trouble, you hear me?
indeed we did. it was the biggest difference between us.
seems like this one's got a temper...
play as... a god?
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy... it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
here we are. this is the place.
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
i find it hard to trust anything you've just said...
i'm yae miko, a light novel editor -- purely out of personal interest, and right now, what i'm most interested in is you... nice to meet you. the pleasure is all mine.
always thrilled to hear you're in good health. but i was really asking about your emotions. have you managed to calm down?
mister giovanni, have you been deliberately guiding us towards a certain goal?
next, i'll bring you somewhere you can really have fun.
er... just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it...?
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
ahhhh, which means... what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
...thank you, master yanqing!
by the way, do you know that clockie's design is said to be inspired by none other than the legendary watchmaker?
fascinating. i'm learning a lot today. let's get this underway.
the tea society is just a code name, did you think they'd call themselves the evil society? they have to have a nice-sounding name to conceal themselves!
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance... i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
...sorry, i didn't mean for that to sound so harsh. i wish i could help, really. but if i thought i had the answer to this problem, i would've said so by now.
you're feeling very relaxed now, aren't you? so then...
well... i do think there's something fishy with this tv.
yes, i think i might ask souka to ditch her original characters and just make you the protagonists in her next novel.
yes, absolutely! the great hero within me is definitely up to the task!
then again, i suppose your frankness is part of your charm.
so you made me go through all this effort to repair junjun just so you could sell him...?
faced with an endless battle, i had to remain focused at all times. had my concentration lapsed for but a moment, the shogun's blade would have taken my life.
this i really wasn't expecting...
see, it's like i said: if you wake up and dan heng's not around, then you probably won't see him the rest of the day either.
(hey, this is pu'er, not mister yang!)
i'm sorry, i haven't been sleeping very well lately. i tend to get dizzy from time to time, but don't worry, i'm fine now.
yeah, they mentioned miss topaz! what's that all about?
i don't care who you are -- disappear right now and let me pass. and don't you ever pretend to be one of my friends again.
hahaha. come on, in we go.
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something...
where's our next stop? i can't wait!
we have heard it said that this nation's sins can no longer be washed away. well, i say that justice is most fragrant when it blooms amid sin!
and then you start to doubt yourself, and wonder if you've lost that drive... if everything were to happen again, would you still stand strong?
guests? i don't think they're here for tea...
i--i don't know what happened there, either... h--hey, stop staring at me...
"mecha"... what an intriguing statement. i recall the bloodhound family is pursuing a criminal -- "a tall male in silver armor."
um... i guess it's because the animation has a retro style.
of course. behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
leaving it up to fate? it's just how that gambler thinks.
is that so... well, i respect your choice.
but he shouldn't know anything about me... he shouldn't even know who i am.
i saw some memory fragments drifting outside the window, and i intend to salvage them.
there's a crowd over there. looks like something really did happen...
"i disagree with your point of view"... that's what i would say if we were still in the plane of euthymia.
and miss firefly, we thank you for all your support. we're faced with a formidable enemy. as long as the astral express and stellaron hunters' objectives are aligned, we're willing to cooperate with you.
ten years of being sealed away has sapped the underworld's vitality. now that the furnace core is no longer blocked off, we need to prioritize the people and replenish our resources.
nothing escapes your attention, miss navigator.
stop! i know what you're gonna say: "march, you said too much back there -- march, you shouldn't reveal our goal to people we don't trust..." meanwhile you guys were beating around the bush and speaking in riddles.
urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
...it is because they're afraid to awaken from the dream.
and i wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. all we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. or just explain it away as a dream.
...an aesthetic you share, miss acheron.
...what? letters from vache? are you certain, mister oswell?
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too...
still doubting what your heart tells you, haniyyah?
what are those people... i mean, those "monsters" we just dealt with?
the matrix of prescience has amazing powers, and can iterate and reiterate kafka's past... so it got me thinking -- if i turned the matrix on me, could it calculate my past?
but misha can see clockie, too, right? they even grew up together, but misha hasn't started the way of the trailblaze yet...
the reason is simple: in this grandiose and ostentatious dream of the family's, only you personally experienced the entire course.
hmm... five days ago, you say...
i'm... i'm really nervous. i've been so worried about disappointing everyone that i've been losing sleep...
am i right, mister lyney?
these are... records of his experiments.
...it doesn't matter. everyone has their own preferences.
you look less like you want to make me laugh, and more like you want to abandon me.
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition...
well, let's start with the conclusion -- the crew was defeated in the battle against sunday. everyone in penacony failed, and no one survived.
*cough* um, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, and welcome to the opera epiclese.
can't sleep from all the excitement, huh? i can't wait to experience the dream world!
wow! they've really outdone themselves! i'm starting to get excited!
don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
the signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
squealing isn't enough! you also need to apologize to the owner of the sleepless earl, and take back what you said about xianzhou swordplay!
i believe i now understand the situation.
i see, but when the count reached thirty seconds or so, there was a thud -- one so loud that i believe practically everyone heard it.
it's exhausting, but i guess you already saw that... which is probably why you suggested i take a vacation a--and get some proper rest, right?
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master..."
it all happened so suddenly... but looking back, i think mister yang was right. tingyun was behaving strangely -- she was fascinated with the abundance's creations.
those were my thoughts when i created you.
*sigh* you've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
huh? ah... i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
this set of methods is already being put into practice at the rtawahist darshan by my adviser, drastically simplifying the difficulty of calculations involved in the triple-orbit problem.
*sigh* now you know how i feel when you copy me.
right! i'd totally forgotten -- that's the whole reason we came here in the first place!
when his experiments were exposed, i spent a long time with oleg discussing how to handle the aftermath.
let's go, i'll take you to the safe zone~
twirly-whirly, i believe in you! take this crook down... *coughing*
but even then, inazuma was left more devastated than we could have ever imagined. those terrible tragedies left great wounds that are still felt to this day, both on the land itself... and in my heart.
uh... that's like naming your cat "cat."
remember, all we need are some wide zoom shots of the streets. if you happen to find some particularly lovely patches of flowers and grass, feel free to grab some close-ups of those as well.
mine cart pin... mine cart wheelset... confirm... just like that?
but what about the rest...?
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality... i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
looks like the next fight is you against me. let's just try to enjoy ourselves. it doesn't matter who wins, this is just a little contest between friends.
looks like you haven't put enough thought into this, little one.
i've had to go through so many moments like that for the sake of protecting the truth. as time went on, it got harder and harder to bear, and i became more lonely and isolated.
hey, come back! we want to ask you something!
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
i... have nothing to say to that.
you have wildfire's full support.
i'm going to head back and make some preparations. meet me outside the yae publishing house.
in any case, since you remember what happened just now... well, that's put my mind at ease.
...how much trouble have you stirred up exactly on penacony?
next, find a suitable spot... and try *walking up* the wall.
after that, you saved firefly and explored penacony together. during the tour, you ran into sparkle disguised as sampo and accidentally entered a child's dream.
in her eyes, the most precious things in this world were dreams -- the yearning for a better future held by living beings.
the guest rooms are charmingly minimalist...
i picked up slivers of her thoughts in the memory zone. these will help you form an impression of her. now, you must hang on to these thoughts with all your might, and shape them in your mind.
here's what i need you to do: go into town and find evidence of the tenryou commission's betrayal.
i see. but when it's so obvious, doesn't that defeat the purpose?
he was already getting ready to leave by the time i arrived. he just wanted to ask someone about the quickest way to get back to fontaine.
do we have an agreement? well then. no backing out now.
...but pom-pom said the banquet we were invited to is still a little ways off. hmm... what can i do to pass the time...?
the debt that vache owes to the underworld rests with me. all i can do is help everyone to the best of my ability... to the very end.
the ground... it's shaking! what's happening!?
people write things on headstones, right? let me think...
a club just for fighting... who knew undergrounders had such brutal hobbies.
if there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. i'm always happy to listen to other people's problems... who knows, i might even try to help you come up with a solution.
the people answered the call of the architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
so be it. the sensation is not a disagreeable one.
hello again... you know, it suddenly occurred to me that you guys have had to do a lot of running around this time. don't you find it tiring?
oh? it appears that you have more skill than i thought.
(i want to tell someone, anyone, about this... but would that not destroy all i've done so far?)
i'll write back and ask to meet with the seelie, and see how it responds.
just give me a sec! i'll play with you once i'm done.
whew... but now, it is time for the hydro archon to show you her courage and resolve!
why... why did i see another me?
ei, you're thinking about this all so conscientiously. i've only got as far as wondering whether i'll be able to sell entrance tickets to the grand narukami shrine in the future.
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him... right?
we could ask you the same thing.
...wait, are you for real?
as for the girl in the silvermane guard uniform, i told sampo to watch her... but it seems that he left his post and she made a run for it.
what!? then go find a workshop to get them repaired right away! oh, and you too, bonnot. go find our spare kamera in the warehouse, and bring it back to the set!
i'm sure this is what the troupe would have hoped to hear as well.
yes, i just so happen to have something that i would like to ask you.
then my duty as her eternal familiar is to drag her back out of her own head and into the real world.
that's right. how do you get rid of the next big thing? you replace it with the next next big thing.
the aim is to try not to get hit by the attacks. since you've escaped certain death at her hand once already, i presume this shouldn't be more than you can handle?
...whoa, the words on the note are changing!
having made modifications to the props beforehand, his accomplice cowell then caused halsey to vanish using the water from the primordial sea.
please can you explain to us again the details of the case?
there's an accounting book lying on the ground. it must have been specially placed there by sparkle.
(sneaking in was easier than i thought. the family's security is as lax as ever.)
if you can get the raiden shogun to "open her heart" to you once more before the statue of the omnipresent god, you will have the opportunity you need...
listen to me, listen to me, everyone... please don't give me such cold and disdainful looks. what happened just now didn't prove a single thing!
when the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise...
maybe around thirty... or forty percent?
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
okay... thanks madam herta.
opennnn sesame~!
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
hehe, guinaifen's enthusiasm is super contagious, i hope we bump into her again.
good. you were out for a while, i was beginning to worry. you were saying some strange things.
today they do! and you're not dreaming. if you don't believe us, pinch yourself!
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market...
if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
pfft! we took down the doomsday beast, the stellaron, and phantylia. did you really think you could stop us?
i'll show you once we're back to the master control zone~
huh? is this still automated?
yeah, it's his problem, not yours.
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
i'm so lucky to have two great masters! but why does it feel like things are getting a bit weird?
i have much to contemplate in the days to come. but at least i can now see the way ahead.
yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
oh, i've heard that line so many times before!
that should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
well done. and what about you, onodera?
when there's time, i'll have to tell you all about what happened on that trip. there are quite a few interesting bits.
it's funny... the moment i boarded the cable car, my mind was filled with everything i wanted to do on the surface...
theoretically, i should be able to answer any questions related to my thesis.
legend has it that there were five poets in ancient inazuma who were supremely gifted in singing and writing poetry. they are known as "the five kasen."
in that case, my dear audience, let's allow the joy of victory to steep for a little while longer, haha.
all right. drift peacefully off to sleep, and i'll be right with you.
well... this doesn't necessarily mean a thing, right? in terms of methods, both the fools and the riddlers could pull it off. hasn't the ipc cracked the message, too?
when i first saw it, i was in awe too. the sky here, it's like... a reflection of the twelve dreamscapes.
okay, we should be going now.
wait, so while you seemed to be playing with your phone, you were actually arranging things with moze? are all yaoqing people as quick as you?
another wubbaboo! let's have a chat with it.
of course not, my eyesight's perfect! come on, let's take a closer look.
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
...i'm a doctor, not an informant! very well, what's the question?
ah, we can talk about it later. they're about to wake up.
oh, please! it's pretty clear they're not talking about you...
huh? you don't look that tired to me... stop playing around.
whew! okay, enough! i'm not taking any medicine. i'll just tough it out!
we must be close... i wonder who she is?
we've got your back! we failed to convince topaz, but this should be a piece of cake!
i bet argenti would think these fireworks were really... beautiful.
and the atmosphere here... is completely different from the previous two scenes.
...is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
i'm super interested in xianzhou immersia and novels! even though i use a bow, almost all the great heroes in those immersia use swords, so i want to be a swordmaster too!
hey! what gives!? the audience is still watching me, you know! guards! wait, where are the guards? guards!
oh, come on... you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
there's no reason to be upset by this. time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. so, you must be happy in the present. you should understand what i mean now.
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
for my sake, and for inazuma's, please... bring her back.
here, these are your wages, as promised. not a single mora short.
uh... you're welcome?
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
ahem... okay, thanks...
it's unnecessary, as far as i'm concerned. but since you are inviting me... a change of pace might well be nice.
if it were me, i'd just leave him be for a couple of days. he'll recover on his own soon enough.
one need only to turn their eyes towards the oratrice mecanique d'analyse cardinale in this very opera house, or consider the indemnitium that is used in every aspect of life.
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
if someone has chosen these victims deliberately... first a smuggler, then a family celebrity... then this murderer's motives are worth thoroughly chewing over.
never-changing eternity is the promise i made to my people.
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
i didn't do much, just helped you leave the memory zone.
maybe that "something" is me... or maybe it isn't... i can't be sure...
with a more powerful shogun, i will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is...
*sigh* fine, you're right... in that case, we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
there must be another lamp hiding around here somewhere...
um... what's going on?
look, look! they're reacting -- seems like they really like this name!
but when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
after all those millennia... is this what jarilo-vi has become?
that was my first time seeing you in battle... you've got some moves, don't you? no wonder you were able to save the underworld.
there was once a brilliant overworld doctor with unmatched pharmaceutical skill.
um... can you please tell us where she is?
hehe, no, not at all. it's nothing major.
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living... fulfilled lives.
yes, this is definitely it. she made it herself -- it's the only one of its kind.
delicious. i feel much better after that. thank you.
wait! i haven't finished yet... alright, let's go.
that puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins...
it's the stellaron hunter girl... i can see her on the big screen, but where is she in the arena?
i will find a way to access more medical resources and help you through your struggles. if i must, i'll get help from the surface...
hehe, guess i made the right decision after all.
taking pictures. writing in my diary. what else is there to say~?
so as we follow the story, it leads us to specific scenes? sounds pretty innovative. what does the message in the envelope say?
yeah, that makes sense... general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
take this one for example: "the good thing about being reincarnated as a hilichurl is that i only need to eat sunsettias to become stronger"...
let's call it a day, shall we? and since we're in belobog, it means another night at the goethe hotel!
(there is definitely more to mister zhongli than meets the eye. i could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
there's no more hydro archon, you know... and it's still a little early to celebrate.
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few... it's just like a hidden message... left by someone for the nameless.
okay, listen up. everyone who's not working on this current scene can go with bonnot to look for the film. everyone else, stay put and wrap up the scene.
the blade that i inherited from makoto seems to be trying to guide me... to encourage me.
and besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce inazuma to all teyvat through light novels. as they say, it's two birds with one stone.
hmm, i guess you're right... maybe it isn't such a big deal.
th--that's not how it's supposed to go...
witness... the will of the weak!
think before opening your mouth!
if the shogun rather than i were to discover them... yes, perhaps she would have left the situation alone.
things have settled for now, you should rest while you can.
but now, the youkai memories that leak from the ley lines are weak. they are no longer able to fly.
alright, i'm gonna give my legs a rest. i'll be waiting for you here.
really? hehe... among my childhood friends, i was considered one of the more athletic ones.
her body may have perished, but she became the sacred sakura. this, too, is a form of eternity.
people join wildfire for themselves, for the newborn next door without a mother, for the elderly with no home to return to.
(...it felt good to be back on the stage again.)
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
...we're the ones who're stuck here! we keep going in circles...
today, at long last, you and inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
ahem... heh... ahahaha... so it is you, blond traveler from another land! why, i almost thought you were someone from that mob of my ignorant subjects, come to kneel and beg for my forgiveness.
this is useful to know. with any luck, it'll help us work out the seelie's identity.
r--really? then... could you please help me collect the rest of the four shroom buddies i need? does this mean my luck is finally starting to change...?
in the meantime, if we want to find that lobby the navigator mentioned... we'll have to try a little harder.
there are no monsters, nor is there anything else here that could threaten your life.
they say kids grow up really fast. yanqing, are you a little bit taller than before?
i agree. tell bronya that wildfire will work with the silvermane guards on security matters. however, things aren't simple down here -- please also tell her to draw up plans in case the situation demands--
*sigh* no, i have no further arguments. i admit defeat. but really, could you at least have left me with some dignity?
i've got goldfish memory -- we haven't had a chance to say goodbye to everyone we met so far on this trip.
got all your intel? come on, let's head over to that great mine, or whatever they call it.
miss tingyun couldn't tear herself away from work, so we've had to gift this on her behalf today.
fine, we'll keep our guards up. our last hotel experience was eventful, to say the least.
well then. the door is open. hop on in.
the shogun can't do much at the moment. come straight in and see me.
how should i pose? help me out here. it should look good but not too over the top. this isn't coming naturally to me at all.
and ultimately, her eternity is defined by fear... the fear of loss.
off we go then... let's take a look up there.
yet, you have endured.
she is a top xianzhou leader... mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again...?
the one who left the stories of the five kasen? haha, i'm afraid you guessed wrong, paimon. it wasn't me~
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine!
ei, how are you feeling now?
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee...)
from now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. and after all the experience they've gained, i'm sure they are more than up to the task.
we can't trust everything kafka says. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
...whoa, looks like the battle here was intense...
this puppet isn't responding at all... did something go wrong?
this is the dream jigsaw, right? so, we're supposed to find the exit? but where can we find the last piece...?
the balladeer is no. six of the fatui harbingers. in terms of strength, he is superior to signora.
afterwards, wildfire began to grow. to be honest, i never thought a day like this would come.
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
the path of the swordmaster is filled with twists and turns. it is no small undertaking to pursue the position of greatest swordmaster in the world.
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
that's enough chatting for now. i'll leave blitzara in your hands. remember to take good care of it.
*sigh* i heard that many were injured in the clashes, so i hurried over here to see if i could help.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
whew, finally... i wrote out my question and put it in the book.
i will protect you. once i gather more information from him, i'll make sure you're safely returned to your companions.
well, technically there aren't any seats... but anyways!
ugh, seriously! i was in such a good mood, too, until they came along and spoiled it...
it's an honor to learn from you, master yanqing!
correct. although it possessed shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. as a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train shingo to become bolder.
he looks like he has a lot on his mind. we can't just let him go alone... why don't we accompany you to the artisanship commission?
i still occasionally practice suturing on my old teddy bear, just like in the old days.
*deep breaths* alright, layla, you got this! you were able to explain everything earlier, so you can do it again...
so... what does wildfire do all day?
no, but i understand why now. it was because the sacred sakura hadn't even been planted then.
incredible... this is really a sight that can only be witnessed in a dream...
never mind, at least it's memorable... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
mister giovanni is right! now's our chance to check out this game and see if it lives up to the hype.
miss tingyun, are the long-life species on the xianzhou... all like this?
also, i'm fairly certain that hilichurls can't write stories. so does this author claim to be documenting hilichurl life from an outside perspective, perhaps?
this again... no wait, could it be...
when i returned to inazuma, i was shocked to find that a great sakura tree had appeared on mt. yougou. the tree that you know as the sacred sakura.
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
what prophecy...? oh, wait. i know -- i think. i don't know why, but it's... in my head somehow...
and what would a festival be without me? i'll be sure to go have a look, too.
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
makoto also enjoyed playing akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura when she was alive. hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
no way. please put more trust in me.
hehe, no need. don't you underestimate the leader of wildfire.
ah, i see... i knew you couldn't have come all this way just to amuse yourselves at my expense.
go ahead and give it a try, little layla. don't worry, the little ones and i will be here to keep you safe.
...uh, a d--detective's initial conjectures are bound to be wrong! totally expected!
i'll be here cleaning the ingredients. can you please fetch some firewood for us?
takatsukasa... another familiar name. they have been faithfully serving the kujou clan all these years?
...well, passing the buck is one way to handle this.
hmm... so should we also take those skills, then?
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
mister giovanni, i didn't expect to see you again so soon.
it's a vicious cycle... the less i sleep, the more mistakes i make. the more mistakes i make, the harder it is for me to sleep...
i... i'm not good at this kind of thing! i think it's best if you do it...
i got here a little late, but i watched your duel with luka -- it was amazing!
hitomi, go tell the others that the test of courage has ended and that we have a winner.
huh? that used to be a thing!?
i can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
are you all right? can you hear me? do you remember your name?
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
hee-hee, i've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious...
what do you mean, "strange"? it took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
(but it's good to see that everything's getting "on track." there are no longer any voices of suspicion.)
you're afraid... afraid to accept that the fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
whew... not bad. how many of these big guys is svarog hiding?
oh? what a rich aroma and delicate texture... i didn't expect you to be such an accomplished cook... with refined taste, as well!
thank you for your concern, dear. but, believe me, i am quite comfortable wherever i go.
brrrr... it's freezing! and this place feels different somehow...
any organization doing something like that is interested in more than just "mutual aid..."
whew... all that running around has worn me out.
i could tell he was giving himself a lot of pressure, so i gave him a suggestion~
that's quite the legitimate excuse... hmm, no, it's more of an "explanation." hah, even i'm starting to get bolder with my words.
a person is defined by their actions alone... i think that's how the saying goes? if the underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
hmph, i'm not hiding or backing down. you challenged me, and i'm here to accept it.
to me, every flower carries a different meaning -- it would take me ages to decide.
perhaps... i might have a shot at beating both masters in the ring?
...that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name...
since you're here... i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
it's absolutely right about everything... i'm starting to feel guilty now, i can't deny any of it.
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
uh... you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you...
it's actually not new, i just never had the right occasion to try it on.
hold on a sec, i wanna get this on video.
i'm good, everything seems normal...
but the fireworks...
i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
at the intermediate stage of my journey, or chuuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. the art of the polearm -- slashes and backslashes.
hey! that's not the spirit!
ah... so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
i think they call that "complaining from the heart."
okay, we can talk here. you asked me about the plan -- in fact, i've been mulling it over for quite a long time.
unbelievable, to think that there would be... remnants of the order on penacony.
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
so, what do you think, masters? does this outfit suit me?
(assertive, with a strong sense of presence, one who can dispel all doubt... that is the character i'm fated to play...)
oh! that's right, i almost forgot...
since we are both here for the same reason, let us work together.
ohh~ is seele starting to appreciate our strength? hmm?
what was that all about!? *sigh* it does seem like you're on better terms after the fight.
we need to get permissions from her? what's she got to do with this?
wh--why did you stop talking? what kind of creepy--
it sounds like... the three of us and seele might not be enough. why don't we go back underground and get wildfire to come with us?
you're saying that the real tingyun is still...
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that i am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst...?
as of now, i'm missing crucial observation data. i need the results of an observation to validate the conclusion of my thesis...
even if there's no audience yet, there should be some staff around. why is it so silent...?
i know! he must have found a treasure map at spare time book shop. he went into the alley to dig it up and then went home with his newfound riches!
everyone seems so devoted to the troupe. i'm sure if you keep chipping away, you'll find a way through.
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
i'm sorry, i'm sorry... i got carried away. please help us out, would you?
also, now that i've relaxed... i'm suddenly really sleepy...
i can't believe how close it is to the city center...
...there's nothing wrong with being a casual player.
she's a resilient girl, but no matter how resilient she may be, no one can hold up to criticism and torment from themselves.
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing... he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency...
i never expected pom-pom would be so distraught...
(is this something that i didn't prepare for at all!? you've gotta be joking!)
i'll be fine. it brought a few things back, of course. but i've made my decision to move forward.
finally, if you still think you can copy the fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment...
it's aaru village, isn't it? reminds me of the first time i was out around those parts doing some fieldwork.
health is everything -- you won't be much use if you neglect yours. let wildfire take care of the furnace core for now. you head back and recuperate.
in my dream, i saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. it bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.
is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
...what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
uh... how exactly are you going to defeat him?
y'know, the more i look at this statue, the less "dan-hengy" it gets...
hey, how did you... i--i was just passing by because... i realized i forgot a couple of items on my shopping list!
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? ...did something manage to sneak in?
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
yeah! see, the two of us would never have misunderstandings like this.
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
no, i recognize my family's handwriting. we are all doctors after all.
we will have to end the frivolities there. there is much work to be done.
eternity... eternity is the only way...
okay, let's see what there is.
i also pay great attention to the ways of the world... just think of this as an apology from me for hiding something from you.
well, i'm not as fortunate as she is. even if i'm a memokeeper, i was still influenced by the power of the order and fell into hallucinations.
tsk, tsk, that's against the rules! i can't let them get their way!
alright, i'll leave you to fine-tune your musical while i go and procure a stage.
it was an unexpected finding from an earlier encounter. with regards to the annihilation gang... i can also prove that what aventurine said was the truth.
phew... miss topaz wasn't kidding... mister giovanni really knows his stuff!
maybe next time. i've got something else to do now.
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
no matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
a punchline with a straight face -- i suppose that's your specialty.
hey, i'm improving! i'm coming up with a plan right now... aaaand... got one!
while that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
looks like yinshu isn't here after all... where could she be?
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
uh... i leave penacony in utter disappointment... is that okay?
miss tingyun... it's great to see you so happy... but i can't help feeling a little sad.
is it just me, or does the guide sound like it's enjoying itself?
the doctor was set on developing a medicine that would steel the human body against the cold. he named his research project "blizzard immunity."
today feels fighting fit.
but after my clash with human ambition, i thought long and hard. now i realize i cannot fixate on the past forever.
my, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
still, i remember the day he received his offer from the medical academy. my parents took me to the florist and we bought him the most expensive marquise stem in the shop.
is that hesitation that i detect in your voice? so let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, i actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
sorry... i am indeed the worst nameless in the universe.
in the end, i passed the admissions exam, and the life i had led came to an abrupt end.
i'm not talking about the puppet. i mean... her. you've met her, yes?
yes, you're right. after all, the shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
what...? i don't remember doing that at all!
that's impossible. it was fated, right from the start, that this would be my duty alone.
satomi is yae publishing house's ace in the hole. her specialty is that she can write all kinds of completely different stories, and all under different pen names. as for what those names are, well, that's a trade secret.
you wish to make yourself my enemy?
hook pretended to be well-behaved for a month in order to get junjun. she ate on time, slept on time -- even stopped fighting with the other kids...
no. i will accompany you into the dream to prevent harm from befalling you all. memokeepers don't need a dreampool anyway.
...this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
...is that really the main takeaway from all this?
the original mikawa flower festival was much more lively. but even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
or... we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
...but, the gate didn't move an inch...
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii...
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
you know as well as i do that she's always been like this. why start fretting about it now?
(don't forget -- he's modeled after you, mister yang.)
because i don't think so.
alright, let's go. don't worry, now, i'll be coming along too.
i will leave the tenryou and yashiro commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves...
...careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
ah. you're saying that he wasn't...
what a wild and desolate sight... allow me to grant you the blessing of water!
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
maybe. but i have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. the future i shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
hehe, everything went according to plan. people started to panic as soon as they sensed that they had no idea what was happening. ah, how amusing.
y--you mean... they're all...
lemme see if this order works... hmm, luocha exits the starskiff, enters exalting sanctum, goes into an inn, and puts down his luggage -- including the coffin.
yeah, he's gone... wait a sec, who're you!?
in the past, i used to have many believers coming to see me at the shrine every day, and most of them came for the same reason.
there's no need to take such great pains. if you just want confirmation... i've already told you the answer, miss sparkle.
don't tell me... you thought even i had been blindsided by the oratrice's result?
well, there's no way he'd get past dan heng's sharp eyes.
what are you talking about -- welt and i have been up on the star rail missing you this whole time! you've got quite the trailblazing expedition on your hands.
but our mission at yae publishing house is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. it would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
wait, i think i get what it means by the "child" and "awe and fear"...
so long, brother. hope you don't forget dad's teaching.
so, sunday is messing with us? he said we'd have a final showdown on the stage, but why is there no one here?
can you stop conflating the show on stage with your real-life relationships in the troupe?
too many faces, too small a budget. maybe next time.
i've been staring at books and my thesis every day... i've forgotten how nice and happy life actually can be.
this doesn't seem right to me. wanna try again?
well, that's settled then~ okay, let's play... huh?
so many thoughts were racing through my head as i was brewing it, i... i'm not sure how to explain it...
*sigh* no, all my friends are back home. i'm the only one who got to come study at the akademiya.
aunt gertie! it's been too long!
are you bored, welt? i understand... but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
such harsh cold... it's hard to imagine anyone surviving in these conditions.
that said, i hear that yae publishing house's novels are all reviewed by miko herself.
wha--! but we caught you! what's with the q&a?
anyway, what's the plan from here?
hahaha... i'm afraid that's just an inevitable consequence of my divine charm.
i shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, onodera. please take the opportunity to have a good rest. after all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
aw, this isn't good... can you try harder? i'm sure you can at least remember your name...
huh? strange, i remember no such thing.
hah, try keeping me amused this time.
but... this is not its most intrinsic function.
you made up the second half, didn't you...?
got it! when in rome, as they say! don't worry, conductor, we definitely won't embarrass the nameless.
that's some strong wind!
...she's gone. well, shall we?
thank you both for your guidance. so, did i pass the test?
you said external forces might be messing with my head, right? that just makes me more curious. hmph, no one gets away with locking up my memories! let's go. i'll show you the way to goethe hotel!
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
everyone falls asleep here equally, regardless of our different agendas...
quite unusual, i must say!
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
"protector of justice"? wait, you mean... that vigilante hero from twenty years ago? the one who was always active at night?
this is precisely why when entering the plane of euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
without the sacred sakura, inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
(imposter? i see. she gave my whereabouts to someone who is tracking acheron too.)
alright, then... who will be my opponent in this trial?
penacony... itself?
huh? mister florian...?
ugh... miss fu xuan, why did the simulation just cut off like that?
i... i don't remember... it's a blank canvas...
peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while...
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream...
you're right, but the things we've seen today have brought back many memories for me.
see you in the qualifiers. blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
hmm? was there something else you wanted to talk about?
whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. did i miss anything big while i was gone?
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
doesn't look like there are any more clues. let's head back to the crime scene.
well, good thing i followed the traveler here. after hearing this tragic tale, i can no longer stand by and do nothing.
i learned something new today... i never knew that the hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
but then the flood waters finally came. and the "hydro archon" did nothing.
we just so happened to arrive during this... invasion. of course, as a -- ahem -- crew of heroes, we're happy to lend a hand.
it doesn't matter how long i'm away from the forest, i won't ever forget the feeling of running through the trees.
i'm sorry, i didn't intend to hide this... i have to fulfill sam's mission according to the script. that aside... there are my personal motives: i wish to get to know this world as firefly.
gepard should be waiting for us in rivet town, right?
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
the door... it won't open... it's a dead end...
was the other puzzle piece... taken away by it?
i invited you out for some simple fun and games... *sigh* i should have known you'd be like this.
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
uh... got it. thanks...
perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
the sighing spirit of the laboratory... ever heard of it?
oh? did she look crestfallen and say something melodramatic like "beyond the reach of mere mortals"? then curl up on the ground and start wailing?
no, no... that's not what i meant...
ah, i must say, i would relish the opportunity to watch the fatui getting a taste of their own medicine...
i was wondering, madam herta, why did you become a championship contender?
huh? we haven't even done anything...
uh... i think we strayed off topic. how did things even get to this point?
it's eerie how quiet it is here... it's kinda creepy...
i never had the chance to see her one last time. but i would like to believe that she kept her promise to me until the very last.
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning...
oh? well hello, what brings you to see me today?
could we tone down the narcissism just a tad?
i-it's you? why were you just in my room...
see that? that's what you summoned. and look, now that shingo's no use, it's coming straight for you.
is that a clue, you may wonder? i'm not sure, although i'm pretty sure that the fatal flaw has nothing to do with that masked fool.
...but given the present circumstances, i'm afraid i must regretfully decline your casting request.
*sigh* finally, all done... i better meet up with fu xuan if i wanna keep going through my memories.
apples and zaytun peaches were the most popular fruits back then.
my homework's somehow finished before the deadline, and my papers are perfectly written.
and that's... the end? there's nothing else in the operations log?
i'm sure this is what captivated director aurelie as well.
here, this looks like lab equipment. maybe vache left it behind.
alright. i... actually don't have much stamina. i've been stressed this whole time, and i feel exhausted...
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
we were just talking to her in the museum... do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
got it, it's all etched into my memory.
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
ah, it's gepard! is he here to meet us?
mister yang! you were going off his appearance this whole time? i thought you had some super secret thing up your sleeve! didn't your mom ever tell you not to judge a book by its--
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
i saw the game was called "akitsu yuugei." i'm guessing it originated from "akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura." the thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
azure dragon, white tiger, eating less carbs!
hmm. narrative devices are truly mysterious things.
yeah, yeahhhh, if you say so~
(so luocha hopped on a starskiff and fled with the help of his accomplice... and that, ladies and gents, is the truth behind luocha's disappearance.)
oh, and don't forget to return the pass permit to me after you have finished with it.
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
little one, the pairings for the remaining thirty-two are out.
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
my body has fully recovered, and the shogun's will no longer fights against me.
i know your power more than anyone else. had i relied upon my strength alone, i would have lost this duel for sure.
that's right, and you're the sidekick!
wait a minute, so we're actually looking for wubbaboos, not passes?
don't you worry. you still have a long journey ahead of you... your story has only just begun.
never mind. i'll be honest with you then, i desire to spar with you.
okay... why?
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
oh, no, i was just thinking about... how those nobles must be so cold-hearted. it's like they don't care about their people at all!
we moved from that building to this building in the blink of an eye... this would be impossible in reality.
you know... how much you're willing to pay me to be the director? the pay is also an important factor for me to consider, you know!
you saw it all for yourselves. i'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
i'm sorry, you're right. it's a bad habit of mine.
huh? but i only just finished packing my bags!
if you want me to appoint a new clan, then naturally, there must first be a new duel.
i feel so much better now that i've gotten some food in me... delicious food really does wonders for one's spirits.
hey, way to boost morale over there!
are you talking to clockie? ...hmm, i'm really curious too...
...freedom... cold... mainly cold actually. let's go.
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
you might be able to remain stony-faced if you really try, but with your tail swishing behind you... hehe, it tells everything.
don't worry. let me think again.
how did the borisin manage to infiltrate the xianzhou?
*sigh* you're too cautious. a gift is a gift -- it's rude not to take it!
um... miss himeko, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn't sound like a negotiation...
yup, got it. say no more. sure thing.
i see... i can understand that.
fists, palms, and fingers... *gasp* rock, paper, scissors! phew! no wonder i was confused!
i was originally looking up some information at the house of daena, but the more i read, the more i realized that my thesis is horribly lacking.
the desert's getting colder now that night's falling. and the wind can really sting your face because of all the sand in it.
bam, and it comes out just like that. no matter how many times i've seen it, it still looks magical.
ugh, aren't you supposed to be dependable?
we've gathered all the missing parts... let's hurry back, we don't want to keep big ticker waiting.
yes. for the longest time, i couldn't bring myself to face the pain of that loss.
i believe in you guys... i know you'll be able to get her to come around!
i wonder what stories have been left behind in the memory fragments that we found today?
(think about it long and hard...)
i'm out, i'm out! it's gone bananas!
so, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave shingo's body. then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
oh, well, yes.
this is science! don't get distracted! *deep breath* focus.
"life is akin to a winding labyrinth, where memories serve as our sole companions."
don't imitate the memokeeper without the accompaniment of one! well...
wh--what? why?
i considered this matter worthy of my attention. so i pursued them, and they led me here, where i happened to run into you.
but after shingo dies, you'll be next.
oh, you're right! i almost got all excited for nothing.
then... i've something private to take care of regarding that galaxy ranger. let's leave things there, shall we?
this is the interior of the penacony grand theater.
...we can talk about that another time! right now, i wanna give you a tour of the town... here we go!
*ahem* i mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
hmm, seems like he won't give in... let me think of another way...
come on, let's head into the city!
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
don't you remember what mister giovanni said? this player beat the last reigning champion -- it can't be her...
i see -- thank you for your keen insight. then let's pretend we were misled by a red herring. hmm... this doll... could it be connected to the case?
you intend to stop her achieving victory? i can't say i didn't expect that response from you. but i hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament... are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
shh -- you're being annoying! i'm not kidding -- this is straight out of the book.
oh wow -- she's cool!
but it seems... in the land of the dreams, anything is indeed possible.
...i will have no choice but to fight.
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player...
she's... terrifying... but she also seems really dedicated to her craft. i hope we can be friends.
if you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. there are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
but behind my back, he had been doling out the reagents to residents who were kept in the dark. when it finally struck me that something was wrong, his terrible research had already turned him into... into a madman.
and that memory... will be as scintillating as the star clusters you see in this porthole.
the exit's over there... how do we get to it?
woo! yeah! let's...
that's a great idea. i've been underground for so long, i almost forgot what flowers smell like.
darn, i wanted to see one...
well, that's why i only have one per day...
morning... can someone fetch me a cup of coffee? more milk, hold the sugar.
have you heard of the complex illness mutual aid society?
i don't know the details. she said she wanted to rest, and i have nothing pressing that requires her attention. so there is no reason to disturb her.
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that...
anyway. it sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see ei's less formal side.
can't we do the questioning here? the stellaron hunters are slippery, what if she makes a break for it?
hey! you should really fix that defeatist mentality of yours...
like i said, i've already explained everything!
every side of me is the real me. people just like to define things in all sorts of arbitrary ways.
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons...
if that's the case...
wow, look at the carved ice! it feels perfect for this city, somehow.
oh, don't worry, i've got everything i need here, no complaints at all.
first, based on the information katayoun provided, we can assume that the seelie is a student from the rtawahist darshan.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
come on. don't crack jokes at such a serious moment.
t--the oratrice? it... it's just like it appears to be...
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone... just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
i also heard that when dreamflux reef took shape, it was the center of all dreamscapes in penacony.
based on what i have seen today, i am forced to accept that inazuma is a completely different place from the one i remember.
what opportunity? what do you mean?
i--it's not that i don't trust you... it's just...
nice to meet you, i'm natasha -- an underworld doctor. feeling sick? take a seat, let me take a look.
(this guy seems promising enough. maybe i can get some information out of him!)
yeah. there was once a time when i was an actress in a masquerade, seeking only to hide the truth...
ahh, but i guess i'm exaggerating a bit... most of it is still due to the help of some unknown person, rather than my own work... hehe...
hook has an uncanny ability to rally people to her cause -- both adults and children. it's a skill alright, and forcing her to be well-behaved puts a lid on it.
yes. plus, she'll definitely want to hear how the end of the show went...
because... aren't we supposed to be inside a dream? how could someone die in a beautiful dreamscape like this... shouldn't only good things happen here?
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
the important thing is not the format but the creative work itself. it is impossible to come up with anything fresh if you're stuck using some rigid format of the past.
it's all good. we've had you for practice.
that was to be expected, of course. the guilty can never produce proof of their innocence.
sounds like we did it. let's press on.
good. i'll have someone attend to this shortly.
huh... how can this be? did i underestimate the caliber of this material?
what do you think? any idea what the correct order is?
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
actually, i didn't defeat master yanqing...
let's take a look at what it wrote...
i see... but that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
but maybe this blizzard immunity can now bring benefit to others... even if it was made by a monster.
there are wounded everywhere...
it's up to you... do you wanna try something different?
it must be difficult for asta. being the lead researcher isn't easy.
back in the day, at youkai gatherings, once everyone had had plenty to drink, one by one they'd start soaring into the sky with their youkai powers. there were so many of them that their silhouettes would block out the moon.
there is no death inside penacony's dreamscape. that's the promise of the family and the blessing of the harmony. not even a memokeeper can break this barrier.
losing a talisman like that is definitely a bad omen...
miners and their family members. they want an explanation from the instigators.
...but what can i even do, other than to repeat meaningless apologies over and over...
huh? geez, can you be a little more humble?
i guess so, but that still doesn't fix bronya's problem...
so... you think svarog's logic has a hole in it?
darn, this guy's not stupid...
come on, let's head to our next destination -- herta space station victory zone!
let me take a look... mm, so these are the suspects. ahem, hmm, i see...
people are pouring in! kinda feels like all sorts of baddies are showing up. let's get in there quickly and enter the competition!
...ahh, drat! the travel bottles i ordered haven't arrived. although, i hear that penacony's resort hotel is pretty luxurious. i'm guessing their toiletries should be just as fancy.
(no, this won't work... they'll suspect me again. i must play the role that they want me to play.)
i was just out on a shopping trip. i ran out of macaroni, so i went to grab a few more bags.
...which means it's you, mister sampo. i've been using this term of address -- but it was you who first came up with it.
yes. it's all too clear that both the tenryou and kanjou commissions are in some form of collusion with the fatui. hmph, foolish humans, blinded by their greed.
but i ended up losing it before i even finished registration at the akademiya...
so that's why you went for maintenance, way to go serval! i thought you just came up with it on the spot.
i... i'm satisfied...
hey, what are you doing! you can't just throw trash... no way! the words on the note are changing!
oh, serval! so she's gepard's older sister!
what? she just ditched us and went back? how could you let her...
i have chosen the latter because... if stubbornly isolating herself in the plane of euthymia is her idea of eternity...
you are the enemy of eternity...
to be honest, i've always been pretty good at observation, and if i'm fortunate, i might be able to find that special butterfly species...
so... what's the special connection between you and the player, then?
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh...
how adorable. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
...i've gotta say, this puzzle is pretty unorthodox...
let's go, my mom will be there soon. best not to leave old folks waiting!
huh? wait, you mean the suspense thriller novel that was a number-one bestseller?
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
wow, that's soooo deep... come on, stop fooling around!
hey, the "me" in the light cone looks kinda cute, don't you think?
well, go on, time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. i'm counting on you.
we're not done with you yet!
i suppose... pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
no, no, this isn't the time for that kind of talk. we have to hurry and find the clues that the seelie left behind.
then i should do my best to honor it.
ugh, no wonder the xianzhou is so scared of the abominations of abundance -- they're unstoppable!
hmm... using the ipc's cutting-edge aether copying technology, we can record any creature you've seen inside of an aether coin...
seriously... there's nothing inside this dream bubble?
oh, before i forget... navia, the short sword you had with you earlier...
they managed to get away again... ugh, i have a feeling this won't be the last we see of them...
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned... that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
what's going on inside the mine? any ideas?
even if the future is full of pain... we won't escape from it!
you witnessed human memories leaking from the ley lines, didn't you? well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
hehe, study humans a while longer, my little friend. you'll see what i mean.
thinking of you even in your absence, seems like you two were pretty close.
my form is a symbol of supreme majesty, in which has been vested power over all the realm. it is the cohesive embodiment of all that constitutes the "raiden shogun."
the information held in the ley lines is complex and disorderly. the fact that we were able to meet him to begin with was a miracle of fate...
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but... what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
oh, right, she did give me some sort of card...
yes. this is the strongest piece of evidence we have to go on.
finally back at the lobby. if that's the case...
there are too many discarded things in the sea of stars. our predecessors' trodden paths and forgotten pasts should have left behind vivid marks across the universe.
"stairs made of coins can lead to happiness." does this mean we can take it? i'm not sure if it's a good deal... but thank you anyway!
the duties i perform will not change.
cocolia? in order to save belobog, she... i see.
unfortunately, people nowadays only crave to be thrilled, and a mere duel will not slake their thirst for excitement!
so it should probably help me as well, right?
march said something like that at first, too.
continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken... right?
i understand. thanks for your advice.
we'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. there's a bit of time left before we jump. in the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
ah, it has been some time since i've attended a festival... fortunately, i brought sake with me.
i'd like to... uh, i have a commission... hmm, it's kinda strange. how should i put this...
hey, don't tease! i was just being a bit sentimental.
(have i... reached my limit? no, perhaps i reached it long ago. today, i didn't even notice my own tears.)
alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. come on, off we go.
thanks for the concern, kaveh. i just... haven't been sleeping well lately...
hmm, well i'm not convinced that it was makoto's power alone...
chevreuse will be playing the role of the older sister, tulipe, and ayaka will be the younger sister, iris. be sure to get close-ups of the main characters at the right moment.
all in all, i owe everyone a big thank you. it would've been much harder if wildfire had operated alone.
i declare you my chamberlain. in other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the shogunate and loyal to me.
you want to save the people of inazuma from the vision hunt decree. so do i. the only difference is that i'd rather like to save this nation and save ei while we're at it.
yeah, you didn't think the future of belobog was at stake, right?
the puppet, yes. i've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
*sniff* what's that weird smell...
i was scared of someone recognizing me for who i truly was, and exposing the secret i swore to protect.
i'm going up against skott soon. do you know why i'm visiting you, qingque?
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
honestly, spending an entire night waiting for something that we're not sure is gonna happen might not be the best use of our time...
good to see you too. whew, it's nice to be out -- feels like i've been cooped up inside for quite a while.
okay. i understand now, thank you.
good, it's decided then. i'll get started on making edits to the script.
"uhhh! umm... ummm..."? your brother is your closest relative. you must have noticed straight away when he started acting out of character.
ugh, i hardly see what all the fuss is about. everyone seemed perfectly happy to me.
yep, we're from the astral express~
he doesn't have to be so melodramatic, does he?
hmm? haven't i already mentioned that i cannot make food?
...never mind. i'm fine with silence.
but if we were to change the siblings to two sisters of a similar age... then that aspect of the story might come through more clearly.
seeing as we're in penacony... the answer is "sweet dreams troupe," right?
come on, start praying with me! ! please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
w--well. your denial is very strident, i'll give you that! but what proof do you have to back your claims?
guys... does this place feel weird to you? it feels like... like there are loads of eyes staring at us.
i mean... it's possible. but i can't help but wonder why he's so keen for us to speed up.
you've... met her, right?
i'm sorry... i'm so sorry...
the express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for me!
wow, what a beautiful lobby! it's gonna be soft mattresses and cushiony pillows tonight!
huh!? so it's you! you're the one who was threatening to take us out in the snow plains!
that place up ahead is aideen park -- everything here is themed around soulglad. it's a little crowded, so make sure you stay close to me.
but one by one, all the obstacles are being removed. now is the time to rally the troops.
i only heard her voice. i wouldn't say i saw her...
i'm sorry things are getting all bleak and serious... let me see what i can do to lighten the mood.
have i not made myself clear? you're barking up the wrong tree. i don't want this job, nor do i know of anyone else who would.
yeah, it's been a while, and i thought i should let the express know that i'm safe and sound here.
still, if we're going to hunt the monsters, we need to know where to find them. can you give us any leads?
combat module? this thing's faulty, right...?
i was distracted and... accidentally stepped on an avidya leopard's tail.
youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. whatever shall we do?
it's an exit... following this path should lead me out of this place...
ooh... seems pretty neat, don't you think?
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while...
shh... listen to what the people around us are talking about. the conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
don't wander off, the judge is still watching us...
wait, could it be that the yaoqing people have some secret formula that could help me?
(if i remember correctly, he's already several thousands of years old...)
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
...do you think anyone's gonna know what you're talking about?
this body is an assistant to the one within. but it is also the guardian of the rules.
i'm going to try my luck in the city, too.
we just left there. talk about coincidence.
um... thank you? that's not answering my question though...
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
miss yae is right. also, i'm curious to see what would happen if the wisdom orb is turned off... or malfunctions. i wonder if the fungi will stay tamed, or not?
lauwick, your character has no more scenes, correct?
sure, that would be nice.
long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
g-given the situation, this is our best hope... let's just get it over with quickly!
i can feel your obvious excitement... that means your memories will also become even more beautiful.
i command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. rest well tonight.
again, i didn't do any of the real work. i'm just wrapping up.
i'm sorry. i wasn't there for the whole thing. by the time i arrived, the worst of the fighting was already over.
(i've been getting hungry thinking about food all this time...)
i say "gift," but it's more like bits and pieces the kids cobbled together. still, i hope you like it.
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
ahhhh... well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
haha, oh yeah? well look at you swaggering in like the protagonist in your own story.
haha, kind-hearted as usual. it's just...
"breathe freely..." that's been our wish all along.
but growth is a process and shouldn't be rushed. i will always believe in and support her.
get it together, layla... you've gotta work harder.
could it have something to do with... that clockie that only you can see?
i heard that ball peonies represent "love that knows no end..." it does fit their marriage.
trust me. when have i ever been wrong about something like this?
*sigh* that girl... i'd barely gotten two sentences out.
svarog wants to preserve humanity, but he's not concerned about what humans truly think.
oh? my, you've been busier than i thought.
so we have to clean up and reorder the footage ourselves?
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
but then i'd be just like everyone else out on the streets...
indeed... i've thought about giving up so many times. especially after we almost lost poisson...
everything was ready to go, and i was positive that i'd be able to get some great data.
it's like... like a fight between two friends. if they don't agree to see each other and talk in person, isn't it possible that the friendship could end entirely?
it's been sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust for far too long. but now i've finally got the chance to wear it!
hmm~ after seeing this special modification... i can't help but wonder, do all victory zones have a similar kind of setup?
i'm not that confident... but thank you for believing in me.
family... huh, weird.
you're a bad liar, sampo koski.
oh! also, rubbing alcohol. i kept a bunch at the orphanage, since the kids often got into tussles. i didn't bring it with me when i left... i hope it's still intact.
the end of the story needs to focus back on aurelie herself. she's the true star of the show.
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
that's true, but this... really doesn't seem fresh...
i know your past. the things you want to see, to touch, to know...
right? i knew you were a gamer! wanna check it out on the way?
ah, but no, now's not the time for that.
don't worry, i'll do something about it. let me stack the dream bubbles to give everyone a nice, soft landing.
it's undeniable, being without a physical body has its perks, but when moving through the world in the form of a memetic entity, the danger of forsaking one's "self" becomes apparent.
(hmm... i think it's slowly starting to come together now...)
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel...
hey, isn't that a wubbaboo?
but don't panic. the truth, as horrifying as it may be, is not yet irreversible. there's still a glimmer of hope, and that's why i'm here.
i'll respect you too if you keep your word.
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself... it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
we'll be back soon, don't get too comfortable!
...sure.
great minds think alike, hmm? i wonder, does that qualify me to, maybe, take the position of shogun for a couple of days?
uh-huh, a petite cutie with pink hair. madam herta appointed her to be the acting lead researcher.
the antagonists? you mean all the people who behaved foolishly? what can i say, they're bad people and they all got what they deserved. end of story.
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
i thought mister tail would possess me and teach me some super cool heliobus swordplay...
is he... connected to that past you want to escape?
phew, finally... after all that, there's just one option left!
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
get some sleep if you're tired. i'll be up, it's not like i can sleep anyways.
so... this tablet was created not so that the hunters would be remembered by the people, but so that they would be remembered by each other.
if it's not me, then why does she look exactly like me? and if she is me, then... who am i?
hmm, suspicious... could it really just be a coincidence? i've got a funny feeling about that lady.
but an excess of caution is not unwarranted in this case.
he is only a segment of memory in a dream bubble, but his ambition for the trailblaze led him to leave the bubble and embark on a grand adventure in penacony...
i thought it'd be impossible for me to enjoy something like this. i thought i'd never be able to get my mind off my thesis.
sorry, but i don't really have time to chat right now.
i'm sorry, i'm not feeling very well. everything is... spinning...
abolishing the sakoku decree has a myriad of implications. it would be folly to say that it will be all positive, and there will be no negative repercussions.
determination, courage, love, hatred... all of these will be degraded and distorted by the incessant flow of time.
since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy lantern rite.
you don't "protect" people by imprisoning them.
and then, we returned to reality. look, this is your room.
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
illustrious names? ...uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
who's in charge here? how can they just let kids attack each other...?
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
there are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward...?
as far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. they complemented each other, and they ruled inazuma jointly. so there was no need for the public to know the truth.
that's an episode of history that i am loath to recall. maybe to you, it seems like my response to these creatures was an excessive one.
as long as the final moment hasn't come, it's still not too late...
hmm... two, three, one, four... luocha emerges from the inn, goes to spare time book shop, turns into an alley, then appears at the dock with his luggage...
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality...
so you can try working together with others as well... as long as you can see them, hehe.
perfect! let's go relax and just let the day pass by!
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
well? feeling less worried now?
although he doesn't seem very... friendly, merchants are usually a good source of information, right?
hmm? what is this stall selling?
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
don't tell me... this one is broken too!?
perhaps...? fair enough, it's tough racking your brains all the time -- i'm struggling to keep track...
i think it's high time detective march took the gloves off.
ei seeks eternity. to her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
perhaps, judging from the outcome... this is that person's true intention.
yes, that's it. i'm not making excuses. it's the truth.
who's to say there isn't an even deeper conspiracy lurking beneath the surface?
oh, don't say that. besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
so it's a recording device. diting must have heard its signal and called us over here to investigate.
let's see... "have you found it? the unremarkable place downstream?"
no matter what ingredients we found, we would cook them over a fire, and whoever lost one of our games would have to eat all of it.
heh, thanks, i hope so~
hey, that's pretty good! i'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
their confusion and fear are lucid to me... but i also remember they chose never to give up -- just like miss robin.
i'm feeling like... there's another world in front of my eyes...
if it's a gunfire trial... we should be able to settle it with a fight, right? i hope this won't waste too much of our time.
what? i can pack it myself, you know...
we've passed the test, but we ought to hurry up... the stellaron is at stake.
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
finally, i can breathe a sigh of relief.
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
i see... but why aren't the other people around here scared?
...sit up and take notice, right?
instead, i ended up catching a few mechanical devices that looked very similar to butterflies. i wonder where they came from...
he will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. remember, this is the price you pay.
nice work indeed -- you're sidekick to a genius detective after all!
n--no i don't! *pretend yawn* besides, i've never pulled an all-nighter before! do you know how bad it is for your skin?
...but those are in opposite directions! how about... we go check our own rooms?
come, let's pay a visit to the palais mermonia. the rest of you, head back to the rehearsal location for now, and wait for our good news.
thanks to my eloquent and impassioned speech, monsieur neuvillette was moved to provide us with a fitting stage for this special performance.
why hello... if it isn't the triumphant traveler. and why might you be visiting the shrine? a sign of piety, perhaps?
i... maybe i should feel glad. the medicine might not have been what he wanted it to be, but it came to something... maybe he found some inner peace...
yeah, belobog is a kind of snowy doomsday city... there are heaters like this all over the place, otherwise people wouldn't survive.
is that all you care about!?
however, following this duel, i have decided to postpone the kujou clan's punishment for the time being.
mm, you're right, we need to finish what we started... let's hurry up and find natasha.
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
there should be a lamp nearby. inserting a thermic core should do the trick.
...anyway, that's not the point!
i--i'll do my best as well. at least, i don't plan to lose too badly...
rather than hearing endless explanations, would you like to experience it for yourself?
alright, now that we've gotten all the pleasantries out of the way, let's get this show on the road.
so you've decided to resurrect a dead aeon? no one's ever done such a thing.
hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. this'll make excellent source material, too.
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
well, our war torn bear here just became a priceless doll. not bad, junjun.
that makes him even worse! how dare he use a book that praises justice for his evil plans!
ooh, she marched off quickly. so cold.
(hey! you don't know if you don't try!)
good! seeing you so full of energy makes me less nervous, hehe.
what's with you and always copying the way i talk!
gotcha! see, that's what you get for annoying me!
this monster---- all these creatures----are they the secret the family is hiding?
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
the divine lightning that envelops all of inazuma will fade silently into the clouds...
yes, it does. i always thought that she must have grasped some elusive, arcane wisdom to arrive at the conclusions she did.
well... in fact, i myself am competing in the tournament.
there's a few things that seem a little off about this place. lemme collect my thoughts for a second...
makoto died several hundred years ago in a war that i was not personally involved in. since then, ei has assumed the shogunate.
so here's what will happen during my thesis defense: after i present my thesis, the advisers sitting below will begin to ask questions.
we should be close. this is the way i came when i first traveled to sumeru city.
oh, what's wrong? you look like you've got something on your mind.
there's just no way that svarog's calculations would have included variables like us, y'know?
we're here. th--that's the spot.
it said it knew about my past... and then it stopped talking.
of course i do. it was never my intention to place control of inazuma into anybody else's hands.
huh, you do seem to travel light. but... don't you at least need some pajamas!?
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
your story is one that has captivated me. i really do have high hopes for you... please do your best to live up to them, child.
the flavors... they're way more sophisticated than soulglad.
hey, there's a ride attendant over there!
i know, i know, let's go and have a look!
a dreamchaser story... if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
...in my estimation, there's no question about it. this is murder.
we all used to run around in the woods when we were kids. trees and mud was the world we knew best.
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
oh, and there'll be a cameo for mister kamisato and miss yoimiya as well. they'll be used to show outsider perspectives on the fates of the two musketeers.
i shall return to tenshukaku. miko told me that the test of courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
well then, are you having a good time?
it was an award i used to give the kids in rivet town for "good behavior." can you imagine what an orphanage is like with so many difficult children? i had to come up with a solution to get them to behave.
is this the lesson you learned from your journey in liyue?
could there be anyone worse than me?
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
it's kinda hard to explain...
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too... and, who is that over there?
think of it as a catalyst that can reproduce the raiden shogun's combat moves. i made it from my own memory, which means it should be perfectly accurate -- unless of course, her skills have declined.
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
well, don't start celebrating too early now. even if i have been carrying a curse like you said, how does that prove that i am merely a human being?
this is the address where i arranged to meet up with the almighty merchant. and here's the list of ingredients. thanks again...
hah -- do you just say yes to everything?
everything he's done, not to mention the danger he poses, are beyond ordinary comprehension and completely unforgivable!
"we have decided to make you confess all your crimes in person. the time for change is now, your twisted desires will be stripped away by us."
oh, i see... i'm so glad that you and your family were unharmed.
wait, we're starting already!?
hehe, yes, that's what i thought, too.
well, you see... we are the ones that owe an explanation. if we keep putting off the meeting, it could easily result in the problem escalating, right?
ahh... what a mess! i really want a nice cool drink of soda to help me calm down...
hmm, this bronya is... really different from the bronya i remember.
so, if people start creating trouble for us, they're gonna regret it!
i'll teach everyone some traversal tricks used in the memory zone.
hahaha... and what a fine family yours is, indeed! it brings me great joy to meet such a faithful believer, a descendant of a line most ardent.
i knew you'd pick the right flowers. mom and dad will be so happy.
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
you are not the only ones to be disappointed in me. i, too, am exceedingly disappointed in myself.
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
no one gets left out of my stories!
kujou kamaji is wounded. descendants of the takatsukasa clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
do you think topaz is around here somewhere? maybe her cronies are acting without her authorization...
hey, these shiny things... are these light cones? i thought only the interastral peace corporation had rare stuff like this.
it's extremely precious to me. ever since i was little, i would always carry it with me whenever i'm doing something important.
what fascinating memories will you bring for me next time we meet...? i sincerely look forward to them.
as it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. but the vagrants have their own custom: see it, share it.
you must be pretty tired, mister giovanni.
haha, i believe we're dealing with kind-hearted people here, seele.
oh no, i've already spent too much time chatting...
whoa, this must be it.
our battle... their battle... it's just beginning.
admirers... how come we don't get cool nicknames!
ooh, yes, more of that! do you feel that, souka? declaring a challenge to your arch-enemy-in-the-making before the competition begins is a key plot device that helps build dramatic tension.
very good. it's essential for the kamera operator to understand the director's vision. i'll make my decision after seeing your work.
w--well then! if it wasn't lyney who committed the crimes, then who was it?
you still don't remember? what about "findie"? that's one of their products... oh and the interastral peace broadcast! y'know, the one always being played on the express!
easy, seele, maybe they can help.
(then, we'll analyze where it's been sighted and its motives... finally, we'll piece everything together...)
alright then. i believe myself to be relatively well-read, but with stories like these, i don't even know where to start...
but i barely felt the time passing by.
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything... it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
it's time to tell you a little bedtime story.
that lively young lady told me some things about you...
favor...? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
but their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. for example...
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
no one will disturb us now. here, how about i show you a little magic trick?
it's okay. i find it quite interesting. i didn't realize that this was how ordinary people viewed the shogun.
you mentioned appropriate compensation. perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
drop it, skott is in the midst of introspection.
ah! stop talking! if there is someone here, they're in my bad books already.
and who is this softly spoken little lady?
thanks, huohuo! you've already been a huge help by teaching me how to use the exorcising tools! even though i've only been learning swordplay for a short time, i'm confident i can take down the ipc mechs.
hah! once you bite the dust, you'll know what i'm capable of!
thanks to him, i'm able to make time for the people. i do my best to make sure that they have everything they need... at the same time, i was formulating a plan to deal with svarog.
have you seen this lady?
to put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. to put it more bluntly, there are things that even the seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
miss topaz, what brings you here? do you also play aetherium wars?
of course. thank you, master qingque.
look, i'm sorry, okay!? i'm sorry i drew a line in the sand without thinking about every possible grain on the other side!
as a mark of my gratitude, i will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
where is he now? does he have plans to visit inazuma? if so, i will instruct one of the commissioners to bring him to me on his arrival. i would very much like to spar with him.
i actually grew up in the orphanage. it wasn't until i was adopted by an overworld family that life changed for me.
hey, wait! just think about what you're doing! and... don't mention our names if something goes wrong! ugh, i hope they don't get into trouble... this is nerve-wracking.
so how does this big guy work...? or more importantly -- how do you stop him from working? over to you guys, i guess!
maybe it's because she left home early she realizes that dreams, while enchanting, are ultimately just that -- dreams.
there's nothing there.
aaah! stop it!
precisely! heh... and i'm not even the hydro archon anymore, so all my power is gone anyway.
the people's sacrifice has always caused me immense pain, but in dwelling on the tragedy, i overlooked their splendor... the grief blinded me to how brightly they shone in their final moments.
well, let's not just stand here twiddling our thumbs. actors, to the makeup booth. we'll start on the next scene as soon as we get a working kamera.
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
come on, let's go back to the administrative district and hang out for a bit longer!
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
you've made notable progress. i accept my defeat.
pretty impressive... so if we encounter any problems, we'll know who to turn to for help~
it's the same situation with the ley lines. the parts of them that are hidden underground can be identified via elemental energy, sound, and other phenomena.
can you stay with me while i recover my energy? it shouldn't take long.
going for the big reveal right at the beginning would have been an anti-climax of the most literal kind. i wanted to see how you'd react in a situation like this, and you did not disappoint...
what a pity... i thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. but alas. the time has come prematurely.
...seriously? you're questioning me like this is a court case now. i don't know anything about that.
patrolling the streets is the tenryou commission's job. the shogun has a lot of information to process and orders to give out. she doesn't have time to deal with it herself.
thank you for your thoughts, mister oleg. another vote for the "for" pile.
besides the macaroni, i should also pick up some tomato sauce...
huh? wh--what's going on?
seriously, you even picked a fight while drinking tea. i honestly doubt you have a life at all, let alone a fulfilling one!
i'm also feeling very nostalgic for his tea.
i like keeping busy, otherwise i start obsessing over... pointless things.
mona megistus the astrologist said that those who constantly use astrology to obtain things that shouldn't be theirs will eventually lose the "blessing from the stars."
what do you think? it's the perfect plan~
keep going straight down this alley and it'll lead to an elevator. it'll take us to the center of the land of the exiles.
there's nobody else at the scene. seems like miss sparkle used the same method to "send" dreamers back to reality... let's talk to those two there then.
i'm gonna get some rest after i've sorted these photos. don't stay up all night playing video games again!
scrap metal? this is my sword! i'm here to learn xianzhou swordplay!
nobody wants to risk failing their exams, you know.
bronya? are you okay?
i really can't recommend that store highly enough. a couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
that's right. making mistakes is part of growing up.
well, you can get good at getting lucky~
let's go. we have to find another path...
trying my luck with another phenomenon is better than doing nothing.
are you talking about us this time?
perseverance really does pay off.
oh dear. well, that's too bad.
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
but on some level, freedom also means no longer being needed. i have no further use to people.
but she doesn't seem to be able to move or talk...
i went all out when i was acting as an archon, so why wouldn't i do the same for my own life?
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
you're a fast learner. in short, this is the last chance to get inazuma back on track. otherwise, an eternity of darkness awaits.
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point...
so, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the watchmaker?
let's move on to the next stop... uh, i mean-- the last stop. let's go!
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
you keep saying that -- what did dan heng even say...
hee-hee, yup! when you're free, let's head over to the divination commission together and ask them for a favor.
i can't even figure out these basic questions, and most of what i've learned in the past is completely useless here...
let's go. braving the unknown... that's the real spirit of trailblazing!
*sigh* alright, i guess the cat's out of the bag. of all the times to wake up...
...if so, i'm not sure "mighty" is the right word for these architects.
really? that's so nice... it feels just like a tea party with friends.
the singer, epsilon's superstar... if i can stop one heart from breaking. that's your song, isn't it?
wildfire has never been in this for its own gain. everything we do is for the citizens of the underworld. that passage is a means to an end, not the end itself.
don't worry. i... i will keep hope alive for everyone until the very end.
uh... i hope we haven't just jinxed ourselves.
not at all! you're going to lose -- i mean -- spend all of them in no time once you start playing! just try it and you'll see!
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved..."
oh? i didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. you wouldn't mind it if i took a soak for a while, would you?
not exactly. i already had a vision by that time.
so, the legacy is just a facade...
...a few hours? *sigh* do you have any vacancies?
and... if i win?
you're right. let's head to the lobby then.
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
i didn't even realize it, but you're right. it doesn't seem like there's anything holding me back now.
but, i wanna get to know my four shroom buddies a little better and prepare for the qualifiers, so... i'll go do some training now!
and even ei is finally starting to come to her senses. quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
hmm... i can think of a dozen things just off the top of my head. take a really nice nap, walk all around this beautiful place...
oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word i say.
an important guest? who could it be...?
you bring honor to the title of "guardian of eternity."
i've thought about it, and... well, if i were bronya, i wouldn't sign it.
unpopular? what are you talking about? who in aurum alley wouldn't like a cheerful and adorable young lady like me?
you really expect me to know the answer to that?
sounds like you went through a lot of danger... are you hurt, miss serval? i can have a look if you like.
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
youhei, i suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. this is a life-or-death situation.
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences... and can come to represent what we seek the most.
i'm not sure we can give him the answer he would hope for.
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
wait, you managed to choose the right door on your first try?
hey, was that the yaoqing general who just dropped in out of nowhere? she's so awesome!
remember, your first instinct is very important.
apart from the incense that helps you sleep, there's also... something i trust you will like.
a--actually, i was going to ask... how do you know me, madam faruzan?
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
now that i think about it, that whole speech about magicians making things disappear was nothing more than a provocation, a bald-faced challenge!
alright, alright, it is not my intent to reprimand you. there is no need to state your name. just be off with you -- do not distract me from my performance.
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
in that case, the vote stands at two to one.
wait, i guess. let's give it some time.
...copycatitis still has no cure i see.
uh, um, about th--that...
take them. i have no need.
*sigh* how are we gonna convince her?
everyone's really throwing themselves into their roles. i haven't seen such a fine performance in a long time.
what a smooth talker... though, your eyes do not lie as convincingly as your tongue. you came because you need my help, didn't you?
she's my source of knowledge. i'm merely the representation of how she would be if she were rested and healthy.
worry, fear, or whatever you want to call it. hmm, if i'm connecting the dots correctly, then i think i know where the seelie is leading us.
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
that's about all we can do about a stellaron. it may be suppressed for now, but it's only a matter of time before it regains power.
something feels off... we're in the right place, right?
hah. do not jest. can you not feel it?
this was shortly before the underworld was sealed off -- there were hardly any silvermane guards remaining. we spent ages trying to find a way to handle vache.
no no, after all they've brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. i just feel like i'm starting to understand them less and less...
i've lost count of all the dolls i've made. to be honest, i wasn't expecting her to like this one so much.
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
that tinge of regret i sense... ah, these are the kinds of lasting memories i cherish.
are you going to help this... um, clockie that only you can see?
in the past, we sat in our high chairs in the court, giving our opinions on isolated cases, all while knowing very little about the human stories behind each and every one.
...and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
but the oratrice handed out that verdict unilaterally, and it has been operating independently ever since it was first created.
i recognized him immediately -- he's one of the people that was getting robbed by the treasure hoarders.
what are you so afraid of, honestly? we're finally about to meet the true author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." aren't you excited?
but it's only because i'm not aiming as high... i just wanna be able to take twirly-whirly back to live with me, that's all.
i had to keep all my feelings, all my curiosity about life to myself. no-one could be allowed to know...
keep it safe? is that all you intend to do with it?
i'll tell you, but... not now.
really? we know you're pretty busy...
it's locked. i can travel through it freely, but you all...
if i were to ever discard anything so pure, i don't think i'd ever be able to find a place to anchor myself in the vast sea of knowledge.
(no, it's not the best time to do that...)
hah, you're absolutely right. perhaps they occasionally best the shogun's army in open battle, but when they face the raiden shogun herself...
a package? i left a package here...?
that's just the psychic bond between cute girls and cute puppies!
it looks like the situation is more serious than i thought.
back when i decided to isolate myself in the plane of euthymia, there was no yae publishing house, and certainly no stories of this kind.
hmm? oh, i'm just a tourist. as far as i'm aware, i don't have the authority to detain anybody within sumeru's borders... is that not the case for you, too?
our identities are like masks. when we switch between them, we change the way the world perceives us.
seems like you're a natural. it's not easy to reach this level of enlightenment.
are you ready? don't be too surprised.
but that's what everyone said before we went to penacony! "you'll be totally safe under the family's protection!"
and all before i even had a full grasp of the situation... anyway, i just feel a bit bad about how it went down.
he's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
and since the spirit is susceptible to erosion, she placed her consciousness inside her sword, where she remains in a meditative state, free from all disturbances.
it's not your first time. i don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
but now... i just want to sit down, zone out, and watch the people coming and going... and let the day just pass me by...
the looks on your faces tell me you found some good stories.
that was when ei began to change. makoto was her greatest loss.
everyone rose to their responsibilities. and i finally regained my freedom...
oh yeah, there are some people we haven't said goodbye to yet!
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
i believe i'll have lots of happy memories here.
i heard that first mining team found a geomarrow vein with incredible deposits... the initial estimate put it at the largest discovery in the last thirty years.
human beings don't have powers like us youkai. it's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
i guess not! eagle sounds about right.
so, you mean... the ones who scoured the settlement for me were also from the spina...
you're right. no matter how much of a hard time i'm having in academics, i should still find the time to look after myself and fulfill my needs.
--but it wasn't me! the antimatter legion must've broken it!
everyone, just calm down...
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
anyway. there's a writers' submission event going on at the moment. start by talking to readers and finding out what they're into. when you have an idea of what the current trends are, come back and see me.
haha, well? what did you think? were you scared?
i guess it's time to tell the story of that "mikhail."
although i am no longer required to play the role of the hydro archon, the time i spent inhabiting that character has left an indelible mark on me.
a dream world... i heard that penacony transformed the dreamscape into a majestic metropolis...
march... march? please reply. have you left the room?
he seeks an ending through "death" while i seek an opportunity for "life." though we walk on opposite paths, we will reach the same destination, and he... will not become destiny's slave.
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
so, i will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
hang on a sec, isn't that wallace up ahead? looks like he's finally made some friends! i wonder what they're talking about...
here is the pass permit. show it to the okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
yes, but i don't think i was of much help to you all...
once mister florian is awake, please pass on my regards to him. he must be extremely exhausted, to have passed out cold like that.
back then, i didn't even dare to dream about having someone to confide in.
the underworld? what do you want to know?
the shogun and i will closely review the inazuma of today to find out where things currently stand. then, we will give careful consideration to the future.
miss topaz is definitely up to the job! she has that aura of... what's the word... invincibility!
mister sampo, take a closer look... this is a wonderful smoked red herring.
plus, now that someone has shut one of the disruptors down, the contrast between before and after can provide me with further information still.
i thought it would turn out poorly because i felt rather rigid. but it actually looks much more natural than i'd imagined.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it... they don't teach this stuff in school. wait... did i even go to school?
...imagination is the source of all existence. children need only their imagination to understand the express.
if you're curious about vache's wonder medicine, you should ask some of the patients in the clinic... see what they have to say about the effects.
next time you wish to see her, you can come and take the pass permit from me again. she would never admit to it, but she does, in fact, get quite lonely.
so much for cutting calories...
memory recovery is going well, but slowly. she'll be here soon, and time is short.... there's nobody else here, so there's no need to be delicate... in fact i think i'd better go all out....
great idea! shame we don't have any.
no one knows her greatest strength more than i do -- it's her resilience. if she's able to persevere in everything she does, then one day, she won't need my help anymore.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
ugh... is this ever going to end? i know, why don't you try that... clockwork thing you used before.
come on, i don't need that kind of attention. xavier can accept the reward on our behalf.
bronya moves fast! the crisis is only just over and she's already opened talks with the ipc.
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
huh!? but wasn't it working fine for all the days before?
let's stay alert and make sure those monsters don't spot us.
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter...
maybe the stars above decided to help out after seeing all the effort i put into my research... haha, if that's even possible...
erm... so... during the duel, did you believe that callas was intending to die?
w--wait, that's not exactly what happened... i still regret not helping out sooner.
yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. okay?
as for me, i've somehow become the apprentice to two cloud knight swordmasters, and i've been honing my sword skills with their guidance.
resting? booooring!
after that, it's the end...
i think i'm starting to get the hang of this...
this again... don't tell me, it's gotta be...
thank you. i don't have any further questions.
okay, let's go give it a try. i've already prepared my question for the seelie.
the traces... where did they go? is diting malfunctioning?
they are similar, but not identical.
...no, in fact, i should say, she's hiding everything from us.
haha. sometimes face-to-face communication is more meaningful, don't you think?
i just... stumbled upon a particularly fascinating spot in your memory.
why? it's not like i'm here to cause trouble. let's just relax.
this must be... when the crew first found me? i don't remember a thing.
not all astrological phenomena can be directly observed. some are deductions based on other details that we know.
exactly! he just wants to show off, which is why he picked aurum alley as the venue.
okay! rest up -- you're not allowed to miss the next trailblaze expedition!
s--sorry... i'm just a little panicky...
i'm sorry... that i couldn't be with you then.
i'm just thinking, you haven't slept in twenty system hours... are you sure you're okay?
see these musical instruments playing themselves with no human performers? that's the sweet dreams troupe.
the masked fools... so this really was their doing.
we can't get through here. let's take the way around from the side.
me? hmm... if this was before, i could have simply asked clorinde. but it's already been some time since i last talked to her.
miko, retract your words.
after all, she and i are one and the same. we're two sides of the same coin.
you're the best, master diviner!
actually, i've sensed a familiar feeling ever since i arrived here. it's brought some old memories to mind.
with her long-term sleep deprivation, whenever her anxiety peaks, she loses consciousness and i take over.
yes, no need to try and understand it. let me put this simply: right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
"what's the big deal? we just wanna swim!" that's what we used to say.
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
i have no questions about the case, but i'm just curious... how did sparkle manipulate you?
...great, even if qlipoth were here, they wouldn't be able to protect him.
it's quite exhilarating to be flushed into the air by soulglad, but... why is the venue still closed when the charmony festival is about to start?
"p-perhaps we were never meant to succeed... right?"
oh, what a pity. i was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
here! there are still survivors here...
why did you...!? this isn't what we agreed on...
of course, it would be nice to know what's really going on...
those stellaron hunters... they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
doesn't feel like it's been that long since we last saw you, but yanqing, are you...?
and so when he learned this piece of information, he realized that the victim had created their own locked-room mystery.
mm... it's a long story. simply put, dan heng used the jade abacus of allying oath when we were in the middle of a fierce battle, and summoned the general to help us just in time.
(it once infiltrated the house of daena while it was closed.)
oh, you beat me to it. looks like your brain is intact.
oh, really? but i don't want to take up your time...
hold him accountable? come on, didn't the luofu fall victim to the disciples of sanctus medicus and the antimatter legion? why would they blame the victim?
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they...
nope, she seemed normal to me too. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
ugh, i know, i know... sorry.
when the silver sting swarm lands on a planet, it looks like glittering snow has fallen. after every battle, i look back... and see the ice-cold remains of the cavalry in the swirl of silver fragments.
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid... i can't even imagine what it must look like.
hehe, it would be rather boring if i had arranged every last detail in advance. the chance encounter between you and haniyyah came as quite a pleasant surprise.
besides, if i can get the hang of this teapot trick, i'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever i go...
oops, that just slipped out. it's actually another line from an immersia...
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague...
i'm not asking about that! although, you're not wrong...
she's only steps away from the finish line... she's already made a lot of progress, so there's no need to push too hard now.
allow me to explain.
haha, i don't know how much of a celebration we'll be having... but i know hook and clara will be pleased to sit with you.
hearing urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. in return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
when i'm in danger, i instinctively create ice to protect myself.
in accordance with my wishes, the shogun did her best to create an eternal nation. a nation that, in theory, should remain entirely unchanged over time.
(oh, sure.)
mister oleg, out of all the people we know in belobog, you have the most life experience. what do you think we should do?
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
which means that you, svarog -- uh... you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld... for the time being.
i'm now filled with determination, masters! i'll learn swordplay well and teach that guy a lesson!
but what your people need from you is not your promises. they want your attention... your divine gaze.
interesting... very interesting.
the key is that the plane of euthymia represents ei's inner world. defeat her there and you may well have the chance to shake the raiden shogun's will.
hehe, i'll take the compliment.
it's possible. but what if he was still sane when he wrote this down...
don't worry about it. take a rest, we'll be back right away.
so, i have to pick someone and clear them of "interference"?
...yes, every celebration must come to an end.
she was built to resist erosion. her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
(i thought i might stammer, but thankfully, i was able to convey my thoughts just fine. okay, and next...)
also, i've seen you instructing ayaka. that cold and dignified personality is exactly what we need for the older musketeer.
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
i see... it seems like you have made up your mind.
would "the seelie" be willing to help me this time? what is it actually thinking? i really have no idea...
huh? looks like numby's in a good mood.
okay, off i go. bye!
... then perhaps there won't be any reason for me to go on the journey with you after all.
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
you have a point. there's nothing special about my background or experiences. it could be anyone's...
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
i'm sorry, here i am talking your ear off again. this is a day to remember. we should welcome it with smiles.
you're right. let me think...
because one of the lines said... i'll experience "death" three times in the land of the dreams.
and by the way, since we'll be filming "the two musketeers", we'll need to find an action choreographer... ideally, a professional who has actual experience with muskets.
wait, are you saying my swordplay still isn't good enough?
thank you, captain. we'll take it with us.
what's going on... how come we're back at the start?
i can't decipher his intentions right now... but based solely on the question, i would probably choose to build that dove a cage...
a train? could it be...
...time to head back to the goethe hotel for a good night's sleep!
your existence is more than just an opportunity. it's the very key to all of this. to that i say... well done, child, you did not disappoint me after all.
it might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
huh? something feels different about this place?
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
*sigh* ...yeah, that's exactly it. seems you know just as well as i do.
so... the train has been swallowed by a giant bug? and we're inside its stomach?
ah! i--i mean... not that madam yukong doesn't have her merits, hehe...
speaking of... traveler, what do you think of the resistance army's chances?
hehe, how amusing. the almighty shogun goes downtown and suddenly she's like a wide-eyed country girl trying to find her bearings in the big city. marvelous.
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
hmm... i don't know how to deal with people like that.
mom said they still live at the old house, but they're not working on the front lines anymore. they should still have some connections in the medical school and the hospital, though.
yes. the truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, baal and beelzebul.
...still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
the delusions... they're still on your mind, aren't they?
well, we have to investigate the court at some point, right? meeting the king himself would be a fantastic opportunity to do that.
i'm really worried about the future of penacony...
destination xianzhou, here we come!
i bet, you were mumbling something about "stellarons" and "wishes"... i couldn't make sense of it.
allow me to decline.
...as a doctor, i don't accept that -- i'm responsible for their well-being. my attitude towards this "wonder medicine" won't change.
would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at yae publishing house instead?
hey! nobody agreed to that!
serval! we came past here before and helped you fix a few things, remember?
...you're right. there can be no forgiveness for the crimes he committed. he didn't deserve the title of "doctor."
a vessel arrives at a deserted spaceport... isn't that how, like, loads of horror movies start!?
now we know he didn't do it on purpose... hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
...i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go...
oh, yeah... ah geez, this is gonna be a tough case to crack if even my instincts are off...
all the shots had great composition, and i could really feel a connection to the characters and their lines...
oh, please, you needn't worry. you've just been asleep for a while, i barely had to lift a finger.
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him... not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
okay, everyone's given us a lot of useful information. let's go through it and try to organize everything.
hello everyone! next up, get ready for the mega march seventh adventure, where i'm going to break the speed run world record!
*inhales and exhales*
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself... i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
oh, th--that's completely understandable. what can i do to better gain your trust?
looks like she kept a detailed record of her captor's actions. she even mentions the truth behind the "experiments" on dissolving young women.
i'll head into the city shortly to start my own search. i'll see you later.
as promised, i've delivered the child to you. our transaction is complete.
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past...
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
yes. actually, i heard that you were voted in as well, tighnari. how do you deal with it?
but eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, ei.
so a photo is a visual representation... an impression, like casting a shadow...
what does director topaz think about us having to take on her support squad?
traveler, if i'm guessing correctly... you were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
it belongs to the yashiro commission. a secret unit under kamisato ayato.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
i applied for vacation... you remembered too, right?
yeah... you could be right about that. is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
...time waits for no one! let me show you around!
i believed you were incapable of transcending the past. but it seems my belief was baseless and i underestimated your spirit.
dear gorou, i suppose you must have been extremely nervous when you heard about the prospect of the award ceremony and the photo.
i knew it... no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
this girl's pretty strong... hey dan heng, maybe now's a good time to show off your secret strength!?
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments...
if you could find anything that aurelie left behind... perhaps we can get a better sense of what she went through in her final days.
i do admire his vision and perseverance, even though "blizzard immunity" always seemed unachievable to me.
nice, sounds like we've got a few fans out there too!
hehe... i wish you both a fun-filled time on narukami island.
no need to thank me. rather, thank your own sense of perseverance instead. long have you stood in line to meet me, have you not?
*sigh* fine, i'll leave him alone then. we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
oh, there was a girl and her brother who said you saved their lives. you might want to check on them and see how they're doing.
very good! the wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
thanks, clara. your thoughts mean a lot to us.
mister yang, do you mean... the stellaron is making the ambrosial arbor grow?
hey, stay with it! this is the final push!
(if you let this opportunity slip through your fingers, it might never come by again.)
...thank you. i can't even imagine what you've been through up there. i'm just glad everything turned out alright.
i won't do anything crazy. i just want to wander around and see more of the world for myself. i want to buy some oak cake rolls. i've had a cake roll every day since i arrived in penacony, from the first day to the last.
whatever the case, it's a very warm feeling.
you again? what i do with my past is none of your business! why do you have to make things difficult!?
ah, it's you two. it's been a while.
all i mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: you have to combine it with another print.
don't pretend you didn't hear that, hook, i'm talking to you!
of course i do. if he had been in the magic box the whole time, how could he have not heard that sound? why do you ask?
i overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
you want to... create a situation where all three parties are present?
what? you're still not ready to go?
what are you waiting for!? hurry up or they'll start getting suspicious!
so. from what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
let's search the area. perhaps we will find out.
when that ambition disappeared, he began to doubt himself. as he battled his growing anxiety... he slowly descended into the state you see him in now.
jokes? um, i... don't really have a good sense of humor...
what are you laughing at? i don't see what's so funny.
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
such a direct act of provocation is enough to get my competitive side worked up too.
still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
himeko and mister yang will be busy with serious research. besides, fossils can't compete with martial contests when it comes to fun, right?
yes. five hundred years ago, a great catastrophe befell inazuma.
what should we do? this is going from bad to worse!
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
...what the actual heck is she saying?
then, what is this regret we feel in our hearts right now...?
hey, the shape seems to match. so, this shard is also connected to misha?
w--w--wait a moment! you're... mirror-me? how can this be?
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze... when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
are we missing the forest for the trees here...? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
mmm, fresh food is the best. i feel like i've traveled back in time.
you're so kind. i had no idea i'd meet someone so nice in sumeru city.
hmm? oh, i thought you would have figured it out by now. alright then, i'll indulge you with a little more information.
general, did you... hear about miss tingyun...?
the deadline is looming... i'm counting on you.
i have to come up with a counter plan. and you are going to help me.
there you go, a small parting gift. if one day, you unfortunately fall into the deep waters of the memory zone and there's no memokeeper to join you -- hopefully it can guide you on my behalf.
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
taking every chance to pat yourself on the back, i see.
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
...let's leave it for now. i'll feel a lot better once i've gotten rid of this mess that vache left us.
(the stamp... hmm, which probably means they're a rtawahist student...)
you say that... but do i see your ears saying otherwise?
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky... but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
i'm sure the others will also be here in no time. hmm... xavier, if we end up getting called on stage, shouldn't you come up with a name for our crew?
well... doctor jiaoqiu? are we really doing this? shouldn't we defeat him in a more honorable way...? maybe we should just completely forget about this idea.
however, convincing their most chronically lazy member to help us is well within my abilities.
hook does always talk about wanting to go on a rivet town adventure... this could be bad.
if you're interested, i'd be quite happy to do a reading for you two.
you already asked that when we first got here.
bravo, good show! you certainly live up to your reputation.
huh, how'd you figure that one out?
*sigh* you rascal... you only come and find me in situations like this.
you seem like a pretty important person. what brings you to this kind of place?
(so what! this is the tea society, remember?)
...you're right, not the best moment for distant memories, i don't want to waste your time.
hehe... oh, don't worry. the change is already underway.
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
i can't believe it, but in the end, no one was disappointed in me. what a relief.
i had an opportunity to feast with him once, back when i was just a kagemusha attending a gathering of the gods. so he's made his choice. be that as it may, i don't believe his story is anywhere near finished yet.
at his age, he might not appreciate the extra... excitement.
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
especially those who came in pairs. nine times out of ten, they were here seeking to know their future fate, hoping that it would be a lifetime together.
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
wait, no, no, no. i'll definitely lose...
huh! in the sewers!? is the film still okay?
a witness... ah, yes. i've heard that you came to teyvat from beyond the stars, yes? in other words, you never belonged here...
h--hey, not so loud...!
"keeper"? you mean guard, right?
that's why it's so important to develop close connections with your teammates.
huh? what's wrong? why aren't you saying anything?
i hope you realize how lucky you are. if it was anyone else, i don't think i'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
it's a pleasure to journey alongside you once more. it's time i laid bare the entire truth before you. as you might have heard... i also go by another name: stellaron hunter, sam.
an amicassador's seal, a small box... a knife? a bow, and something wrapped up tight... i wonder what this is.
whew, this cyber swordplay is amazing...
it's actually pretty rare for someone to actively engage in a conversation with me like you do.
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
i think i'll start by doing a loop around the competition zone...
i think it'd be better if the ipc avoided it... it sounds pretty dangerous.
...i understand, and i'm okay with that.
the boss of the moles should stick to her word. i have patients to take care of, see you later.
you know, ei never said goodbye to me before she stepped into the plane of euthymia.
...hey, get outta there or you'll shiver to death.
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here... i believe it's about penacony's past.
ah, there you are. let me introduce the team:
huh? arlan wanted to go on assignments just to experience stress!?
that's a silvermane guard. is he yelling at us?
right! i bet you're quite familiar with them, too.
the vision hunt decree has my tacit approval.
you've probably never seen what your planet looks like, right? i took this one. behold, jarilo-vi...
additionally, the shogun has no need of recreation. there would be no need for her to come here just to pass the time or to relax.
why are you always asking so many questions? of course not. i just had to say something because i clearly wasn't convincing her.
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
...that should do. hope it can withstand the snow.
hey! that's a terrible idea! you'll get them arrested!
"the cold has revealed to me my arrogance. how can a child who grew up in warmth ever begin to comprehend a cure to bitter cold."
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
...i still feel that mister mikhail must have really wanted to witness this day himself.
...nope, i blew it... ugh...
great, well, now satomi can get started on that.
...isn't that the drink peddled by the culprit behind the serial disappearances case?
i won't deny, the offer on the table is a very tempting one... and if we refuse, belobog will not only have the burden of a huge debt -- we may also incite the wrath of a very powerful force...
disconnecting from that thing so suddenly has left me feeling slightly disoriented.
y'know, i didn't think things were gonna go that smoothly.
hehe... before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
...but still, i appreciate your help. i mean it from the bottom of my heart.
you're right. the more challenging it gets, the harder i should try.
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible... factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
that's a tough one, alright... there's plenty more besides memories held in the ley lines.
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
but seeing as you're a hero who's been all over teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
for now, while i figure out the form that eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
hmm? have you finished exploring the festival?
i'm not sure how to put this... i'm really happy about everything that's happened, but i'm also feeling a little sad.
marquises... expensive...
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
what does that mean? it's just a picture. are we supposed to meet someone there?
that's why, during this golden soiree... she is the dance's centerpiece.
it's clear that in each of the erroneous samples, one of the stars underwent a significant shift. this means that...
isn't that topaz's support squad?
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
this is it! the entrance to the corridor of fading echoes victory zone!
you didn't want to listen to us! we were here to rescue you and you started a fight for no reason!
why are you still here? go find dan heng! exciting adventures are waiting for us.
ha, my observational skills are second to none.
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
yes, and you are the hero.
oh, sorry, i'm starting to ramble again. what were we talking about before...? oh right, why the seelie led us here.
hehe, i suppose so. once they're done writing the manuscript, i'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
...if you haven't got anything nice to say right now, zip it!
(is this situation salvageable at all?)
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
"to layla"?
so i am afraid i can't help you.
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
isn't that a bit unnecessary?
unlike me, makoto was no martial artist. whenever similar crises had arisen in the past, i was always the one to face them in her stead.
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
they won the archon war together, and when baal established the shogunate, beelzebul became her kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." in other words, she acted as baal's body double.
and if i was not the archon, then how did i manage to live for over five hundred years?
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you...
so be it. well then, you who would defy eternity... time for you to enlighten me.
let's write about inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? i can help with this one. we can use the vision hunt decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
before one makes a plan, what is the most important thing one must do?
nor do i think it is any great shame. there is no lack of fine actors or inspirational stories, either on or off the stage.
we must do everything we can to prevent that.
i will say, i never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, clorinde.
should we wait here, or go find the messenger from the divination commission?
well, what do you say? aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
i understand, miss bronya -- no need to explain. your city is facing immense difficulties -- my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.
that's just the work of my subconscious mind...
however, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
ugh! what, are you reading my mind now!?
oh, she had a bunch of codenames. i heard she would just come up with a name on the spot whenever she was asked...
ah, no, i mean, i nearly gave in to the sheer enthusiasm they displayed... hahaha...
although i have some understanding of the situation already, it could take an unexpected turn at any time.
i--i don't know, either... i don't even know where to begin...
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent... and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister... no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
is that so? well, in any case, i just feel like even in your personal life, you don't get emotional very often.
(he, uh... had no choice? times are tough.)
*sigh* leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of inazumans.
it's not bad if we're resolving a misunderstanding!
is this order really correct? lemme see...
if nothing else, we can safely say that we accomplished what we set out to do.
yeah, who knew it'd get to this point... miss yae has to face off against haniyyah...
gah! hook, say something -- you're freaking me out!
no, i'll fight, too.
awwww he's so cute!!!
so if you don't mind, i'll go and take a look at the other patients?
yes, however... if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
i was just drifting out there in space and got picked up by the express. amazing, right?
oops, she's heard us...
why of course, but now's not the time.
so, in argenti's eyes, wubbaboos are a thing of beauty...
what do you mean? that's me too, y'know. the "me" that my patients see, at least.
...you and i have both witnessed the great loss that progress can bring.
this view is nothing like the views in belobog... if my brother were still alive and standing here on the express, i wonder what he'd make of all this.
...you think you look alike?
hmm... i'm really interested to check out this troupe's performance, but it really sounds like the edo star is in a lot of trouble. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
but even so, they are due a resolution... i owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
we sure showed those troublemakers who's boss! are you okay, eric?
that's possible. you see soulglad everywhere these days, so it wouldn't be a surprise if someone brought a bottle here.
they even dared to doubt their archon... i must teach them a lesson. hehe, i can just imagine their twisted and frustrated faces once they realize that i'm nowhere to be found...
right! we haven't asked seele!
with me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together... we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
what's wrong? you look like you were about to say something.
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
it's open! oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, dunn!
ah, i see. so in other words, i need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
are you trying to start another fight...
so you suggest accepting aventurine's proposal to team up?
(calm down, furina... think. think. what do the people want? how would they imagine a god to speak and act?)
the answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details...
like madam herta? hmmm, that would make sense. anyway, it's really weird for a xianzhou native to look so old.
good. then i'm free to alter the script as i see fit?
just some suggestions at the memory level. if something happens in everybody's memory... then that something becomes a fact.
but even the tea that is most bitter to the tongue, once swallowed, leaves some sweetness in the throat.
i noticed it also. just now, in the heat of battle, it seemed to unleash a new and unfamiliar power.
as wildfire's leader, i couldn't simply look on while you fought on our behalf. we had to come help.
hmm... well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, i wouldn't say no.
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
jade stone can be pawned off, but not everything can be used in an exchange. outside of life itself, there are more valuable things that i don't want to give up.
but only if you feel this is something that would help, of course.
i'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. unfortunately though... it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
yes, that is true. but now that the sakoku decree has been lifted, inazuma is no longer the same nation that once resisted change tooth and nail.
yes, it's still on repeat... ah! there we go.
why would you think that? i've never harbored any ill intentions... well, not when you were around, anyway.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down...
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself...
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe... an explanation.
no! i swear i've never done anything like that. what is going on...? let's open it and see what this is all about.
it's soulglad! but i thought they didn't sell soulglad at the bar?
hmph, do you even know who you're talking to? if your boss knows to treat us with respect, you'd better start showing some yourself!
look! that's the statue of clockie, penacony's famous cartoon character!
yes. though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the ley lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
nah, i don't think so. i don't like you.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
huh... looking back now, it all seems quite dangerous... but i had the crew there with me, so the problems didn't seem all that bad.
not long, luka. best brace yourself.
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
your trauma isn't getting to you, is it... take it easy. it'll be fine.
things just got serious. "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is an all-round hit, summarily beating the novels of the yae publishing house by every analysis.
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
woah, woah, woah. it's not like that, paimon!
all of you, stay focused. i'm right behind you.
huh... i really didn't expect the people in the city to keep us at arm's length like that. i totally thought the hunters would be treated like heroes.
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony... but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation...
ta-da! guess who's back?
(i may be able to come up with a more concrete lead if i keep thinking...)
it's hard to imagine that the xianzhou alliance actually agreed to accommodate the ipc's request, don't you think?
hook, you're upset that you don't have a gift for your daddy, right? well, what about this?
look, a solitary chain. go say hello to it.
the ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. this is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
land of the dreams, penacony.
i'll keep up the search. that said, i've noticed that the number of butterflies in the city has already decreased a lot compared to when the event started.
one thing though -- we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
oh, okay, i see. so ei's decided to palm inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date...
...well, this teddy bear has sure been through the wars. don't worry, i'll help hook repair junjun, but i'll need to find some stuffing...
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow...
hey, that's enough! picking on a kid, are we?
...i can't help but think that whether it's mister mikhail, mister tiernan, or madam razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories...
...no, i figured i could just learn it by drinking flaming potent tea.
*sigh* velite just left the express too -- he looked really upset. i guess he didn't know what argenti was thinking, either...
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
oh, was she whisked away by work already? i was just about to tell her how great she did.
you must be wondering how someone can be so clumsy...
it's a strong opening -- an easy way to grab the readers' attention. never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
i don't know why, but a lot of people recommended me. i didn't sign up myself. i just woke up to find my name on the announcement board.
i'm not entirely sure what it all means. maybe mister gallagher can shed some light on it?
no, not this frame. it's the one surrounded by puppets.
no, it wasn't that bad. it really depended on how lucky you were. grilled apples and sunsettias are actually quite delicious.
next time, maybe ease off on the surprises?
thank you, master yanqing!
hehe, no need. while what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
ah... but i'm actually not bored at all.
elio only gave me one instruction: allow the astral express to pursue the grand legacy. it means that the watchmaker's legacy holds great significance to trailblazing, and to you.
the moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of eternity. i shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
you're right. i've been doing research for so long that i'm used to having a certain routine...
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
i trust that she's capable of doing that, and it's something that she should do on her own.
again? i'm starting to get nervous of "arranged rest" on this planet...
look, that's the penacony grand theater over there.
so far, so good. a classic tale. what happened after that?
(the day's finally over. i haven't had a moment to breathe this whole time...)
oh -- i've been wondering -- you see that heater over there? why do they keep it outdoors? this city is so weird...
but what if they... and we... aren't really that special?
i have to thank you, mister assistant detective. but... the puzzle this time is pretty strange.
i'll take his records and data with me and continue what he started. one day, the world will see a perfect blizzard immunity.
the stores have changed, and so have the vendors... well, that's to be expected.
be serious! i really wanna know...
the pose is exactly the same and so is the scenery in the background... i can't imagine how it's achieved.
they thought their god would protect them. they had absolute faith that when disaster struck, a divine power would save them from harm.
you'll remember these words dearly, won't you?
...if she was there too then... i understand. she wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? clara's always been a kind-hearted girl...
um, it's just something i read in an academic publication. i really love to read mona's essays...
(but what if... what if it's really alright?)
only rules shall remain constant for eternity.
what do you say? ready to call it a day?
drifting memory fragments...
look over there! i think i can see the next unit.
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip... how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword..."
i need to go to the cave below the grand narukami shrine.
i don't know whether you can tell, but... the years of suffering and loneliness aren't the only reason i have a hard time facing up to who i used to be.
that's right! i'm your ancestor!
now, it seems like she was right, while i took the wayward path.
(how strange... this uneasy feeling seems so real. how did they manage that?)
you gathered a crowd, prepared a stage, and made sure that the champion duelist would be immediately ready for a fight...
well... maybe it's better not to mention it... haha.
three, two, one...
*gasp* do you have to put it like that? that's scary...
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy... it must mean we're doing something right.
should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
we're back here again. aventurine actually chose a really conspicuous location...
...sorry, it's so beautiful outside... i got a little lost in thought.
it seems like the intel we got from svarog caused her a significant shock... but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
do you think they felt the effects of the battle just now...? let's go ask around.
hey mister, are you manning the counter for the young shopkeeper of spare time book shop?
wh--what...? ah! you're so annoying! stop scaring me!
that's right... we're still waiting for mister giovanni's mysterious elite player to show herself.
it's always easiest to just run away from your problems. but that never fixes anything. you can't get around the obstacles without facing them.
exactly. gallagher suggests that the real traitor is someone else... probably within the oak family.
look! there's a big crowd around the clinic.
there are things... i'm hiding from you...
sounds fun, but there's a chance it won't suit my mom's taste. let me think...
clockie? i can also see him... is this character part of the show?
why are there seven people all striving to have a relationship with a single male protagonist? is this some sort of narrative device, too?
hah -- and who do you think were the inspiration for the tea society? us, that's who.
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
hehe, any other details to share? we've heard that shingo has been behaving rather out of character since then.
exactly! i prefer the cool, calm and ruthless way of doing things - that's my kind of style!
due to the difficulty of designing an experiment and the challenges of validating theories about the past, astrological research is usually based on an immense foundation of experience.
the thing is, i'm terrible under pressure, that's just my nature. even the thought of everyone's expectations back home is enough to make me feel nervous...
in the blink of an eye, you knocked that big fella into mister yang's black hole and saved me... i still haven't thanked you properly yet...
huh? did i... did i faint? or did i fall asleep?
i... um...
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will help you safely reach the floor right below this room.
incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits."
uh... is it that difficult? wait, does this game suck?
c--come on! how could i possibly lack confidence! you believe in me, right, masters?
to the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. luckily, i'm ei's familiar, so i can sense her rough whereabouts.
how about we start with your name? now, should we call you misha? or...
the major flaw, which contradicts all the known information, hides in this story...
darn it! he's got extra hands!
this has certainly been a memorable series of events.
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
mmm... what's this little device here for? could you please let me know? it looks like a little button.
so... you mean to say... your father intended to die in the duelists' ring?
get ready. looks like another fight is about to begin...
oh, i know! it's that "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," right?
excuse me, have you ever heard of the wisdom seelie?
it was there and then that i resolved to pursue eternity. as a testament to that decision, i saved her realm of consciousness just before it collapsed completely, and brought it back to inazuma.
i see what you mean... yeah, somehow beast-tamers like him make me feel a little... sad.
brr! how do people living in all this snow celebrate anything...?
he wandered off, but he left behind the puzzle piece.
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway... they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
i don't know what you're talking about -- but you know acheron, the galaxy ranger, yes? i have something to ask you.
the furnace core... the path to the surface is close at hand now.
now then, my good, noble chief justice, should we not, in your view move--
even the air here feels more relaxing.
um, is it too late for a do-over?
hmm, assuming the seelie is intentionally linking the clues to my past, ah, i think i have an idea.
aha! there we go!
precisely. according to the rules i designed for her, matters of this nature are to be delegated to the tri-commission.
perhaps, there will come a day when you'll willingly share your memories with me -- i eagerly await such a time.
since this offer comes from those who left us to our fate for more than a decade... how would you react if wildfire refused? hmm? would you use force?
wait, when did this happen exactly?
(i wonder.. if clorinde's master were the champion duelist back then... would that duel against mister callas have gone differently?)
these poor little things stumbling about...
oh, we're okay, i was just curious about the heater...
ah, we're finally back! ...i forgot what fresh air tasted like... nom, nom, nom.
looks like we won... let's hurry up and get to the next stage.
there's no one willing to help her here, so i have to step in.
sorry, i needed to take a moment.
oh... yep!
but skott will definitely use the ipc's mechs. there's no way i can take them down with just a couple of swords, right?
no need. there's no place for such things in my life.
the weather today is perfect for observation. let's see if it shows up.
unfortunately, this path ultimately leads one to the lair of "death."
do you remember us walking through the snow plains?
the last couple of trailblazing expeditions have been downright terrifying... it's about time we had some fun, cozy, and cute adventures for a change!
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
--seele's lack of outright rejection means she approves of you, hehe. with you all accompanying her, my mind will be more at ease.
pom-pom knows how to keep people on the edge of their seats.
what kind of trick did they use? when we were tracking them earlier, they looked just like normal xianzhou foxians...
you may not have the courage to challenge me, but i trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
but master yanqing, facing you in a duel... do i really stand a chance?
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
i've read "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." it has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
...if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
do i even need to say it? i think we're becoming fast friends... isn't that enough?
hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.
i'm happy to see that you've kept your wits, and that you haven't been affected by the *primal dreamscape*. how lucky.
so, your first possession, hmm? what was it like?
actually, we've already met the watchmaker...
i think we've all seen enough now, and we have ample witnesses to my flawless reasoning.
hah! if by that you mean "thank you, miko," then you're welcome. haniyyah needed a little pep talk to perk her up so that she would join us in taking a stand against elchingen. how else was i supposed to motivate her?
i'm the garden of recollection's memokeeper.
...i thought we talked about copying people.
i'm so sorry mom... i'm so sorry. for ten years, i left you both in the overworld. mister oswell, i'm sorry you had to bear all this weight.
back in this office again... the last time i was here was... the last time i was here.
but, since there are so many doors here... we should be able to leave through one of them...
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there...)
let me see which one we should try first...
i should not have left it this late to make this promise. but from this moment forth, know that i shall be true to my word.
so you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "the miraculous adventures of the traveler."
you can call me... the memokeeper, black swan.
ahhhh. there's nothing like dessert for improving one's mood. much more enjoyable than meditating alone all the time.
that's the spirit! come on, we should take some more photos before we head back to the express.
so. any plans for the next step?
forty-seven... forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty!
so, who is he talking to? do you know anything about it, misha?
excellent, that was beyond mesmerizing! even i didn't expect this scene to go so well. and we got it in a single take!
...miss topaz! i never thought i'd run into you on penacony.
okay, we're done with chapter one. let's move on to chapter two.
have you been down to the beach by any chance?
it's a common trope in light novels, right? you just have to have a bit of bravado. as soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is wildfire.
which means that the content of this book must have been approved by her... in fact, no. it may even have been her idea in the first place.
well, right now, i'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
you two may not be able to phase through physical structures like memokeepers, but i've got a great idea that will let you safely reach the floor right below this room.
hey? aren't we supposed to kick off a short story and have a fight here just like we did in the previous acts? why aren't any of these puppets saying anything?
i just can't help but... feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
(huh? does that mean hu tao also knows...!)
how about you? can you relate to that feeling? it's almost like not knowing the world will change or ever expecting it to change.
so, how long am i going to have to play this role?
i think it's rather good. a lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. from ordinary soldier to great leader -- a fresh take on a timeless classic.
s--sorry, master diviner!
...give it a little push... and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
we might as well just be direct and ask her where she is. she seems like the type of person who appreciates a straight approach.
"dealt with before"? so... "death" does happen in penacony, if i understand correctly?
i heard the xianzhou can tell your fortune -- is that how they do it? anyone can count on their fingers...
let me see... what? we're losing market share?
hehe, please just disregard my presence. now, tell us what you discussed.
general, keep those eyes open, now's not the time to fall asleep!
alright. listen up, everyone.
are you done ordering? then i'll pay up.
only two more... isn't that super risky? ahh! i don't wanna become an ice cube floating around in space again!
how did you know that was perkins...
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
think about it. how can you conclusively prove that an archon can't also be affected by the primordial seawater?
oh, alright, alright. then tell me, when did your brother spar with domon's disciple?
by the way, there's really no point in trying to hide the way you feel.
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
the stars in the sky are something that brings happiness to people.
i know. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
yeah. i can't ever tell my classmates about that. i'd be a mess if they ever reported it to my adviser...
oh... am i understanding this correctly? a masked fool, inviting me to work together?
i see... though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
huh? the vidyadhara? you mean these pearls will turn into people?
hmm? but the competition isn't over yet... oh, layla, layla... she's really a bundle of nerves, isn't she?
it's rare that i'm this serious, can't you just humor me for once? sheesh!
i have my ways, and i've been working on them for all this time... even if you look down upon me, you have no right to judge me!
no, no, no, this is a completely different situation! hmph, pearls before swine...
hey there, clara! huh? is svarog not around?
it's a very cute room, miss march... just like you.
the memokeeper may be able to teleport the bomb to a deserted location, but... i've found a note inside the doll.
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
haven't i already made myself clear? i won't act or perform in any role ever again. no exceptions.
uh, about this question... i, umm...
but i did have the chance to think some more about that thing that was weighing on my mind, and i realized something.
she left us a letter. hmm... could this be one of those "open-in-case-of-emergency" letters? i've never gotten one of those before. should we wait until we run into something dangerous?
i say that our powerful magician, mister lyney, is now the prime suspect for the serial disappearances case.
after leaving inazuma, hmm... i think it would be easiest for you to go to sumeru.
and we've already defeated florian, right? so, he won't try to take it from us anymore.
take all of our fungi and defeat her fair and square. force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
since the goal here is to bond with our fungi, we should treat them as friends and create happy memories with them. eating and having fun together are vital components of "friendship training."
i want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. it meant a lot to me.
geez, did you join the antimatter legion when i wasn't looking?
i think this moment heralds the third time.
huh? but we haven't even done anything... is his imagination running wild again?
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
in the end, i simply had to accept that it was a miraculous effect of makoto's consciousness.
perhaps, we can think of another way?
hmm, alright. it seems that your crew really can't go on without my care and direction.
the person who tingyun trusts the most is madam yukong, right?
...please, everyone, anyone, just listen to me. i swear, i really am your archon...
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
you mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. otherwise... you will be cursed with bad luck.
the content is fine. now we just need to promote it.
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span... in and of itself, that's very unusual.
hold up a second! i need to think...
oh? i guess you're pretty clever. but before you open the pouch, you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
the surroundings are different from before. the stage decorations... look a bit tidier now?
there's a major flaw in the story you have experienced, yet within that flaw lies a glimmer of hope.
you dare to run from me? stop right this instant!
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
evening, jessie! uhm... is it evening?
a little bit of sugar and a good view really go a long way for relaxation.
sounds like you're speaking from experience...
is this... anything to do with kafka?
i simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. she's more fragile than i'd imagined.
people will never achieve true happiness in a world like that! they would just be toys for the aeon!
gorou has a beautiful tail, don't you think? doesn't it make you want to stroke it?
but what were you doing here if the house of daena was closed?
we've arrived! from here we need to take a starskiff to the cloudford victory zone.
each time he finished a tricky operation, my mom and i would buy a single stem of sunshine, then pin it on the chest pocket of his apron.
since i'm just an ordinary person now. they'll probably just laugh in my face if i go asking them for help...
i felt very sheepish, having had a change of heart after flatly refusing you. and then, to make matters worse, you caught me...
yeah. i feel like some of the weight has been taken off my shoulders after chatting with tighnari.
i just got a minor fracture, so i had to rest at bimarstan for a while.
i don't know much about my life story... but i do have extraordinary skills!
can you wait for a minute? i'd like to wash my face. i think it'd be refreshing.
he needs you. it's essential if we want to reclaim penacony. recognizing his immense potential and the invaluable memories he can help me gather, i opted to join forces with him.
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of...
yes. now... who else do you think might be benefiting from the vision hunt decree?
if aventurine wants to bring down the family, he'll have to create a big enough chance. after everything he's done so far -- what is his goal...?
come. let me give you a list of materials we need.
hehe... slow down, no need to rush. let me guess.
we should be close...
if her condition grows any worse, it's possible that i might cease to exist as well. then there wouldn't be anyone to help her.
garden of recollection... is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
i brought gallagher here. it's time... to face the "truth."
weird stuff like this happens a couple of times a week. and it's bad luck for the one who hears it: it means you'll flunk your next exam.
wanna have a pillow fight later? huh? huh? i bet they're stuffed with goose feathers, haha!
(...you didn't even take cooking as one of your skill proficiencies!)
no wonder yinshu said she had to cover her nose...
who are you? i don't remember you.
typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor...
good morning... must i really get up this early? just let me sleep a little longer...
it's at the rivet town plaza, right? let's hit the road, there's no time like the present!
they've taken on the duties of the guards: maintain safety and order in the underworld and compete with fragmentum corrosion for living space.
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
well, this chance won't come often, and we do have a tea set. perhaps i should try my hand at making us a pot of tea.
it looks so much like dan heng... i wonder if...
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
i'm not surprised. they'll know that i'm completely against them using this "wonder medicine..."
the sweet dream's collapse... that memokeeper mentioned the same thing. so, it's real.
she sure knows how to boss people around.
good. why were those ipc workers threatening you?
i came up with a set of prediction methods that encompass more than half of the triple-orbit problems. however, there are quite a few limitations and requirements.
that's right, be confident in your work. that's exactly how a light novelist should be.
your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. i imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
yes, i agree. although the pay is well below what someone of my caliber deserves, a great script calls for a great director.
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way...)
come onnnn! himeko and mister yang are grown-ups -- i'm sure they'll cope without us for one night.
hehe, if you find yourself at your wits' end, take it out and see what happens. maybe your prayers will be answered, and all your problems will disappear in the blink of an eye.
...what's going on? why is it... getting hot in the memoria?
oh, sorry! can you please repeat the question? i didn't hear you clearly just now.
may i have this page to record and draw?
but as a warrior, i look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
careful, looks like we've got more company! get ready to fire!
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
tell me about it... dealing with a masked fool is exhausting...
you definitely sound like a... what was it again...? oh, amicassador! by which i mean -- nice speech.
vilmant? the one who's playing the role of the villain?
you mean morax? it's been a while since i last saw him. a surprising decision by liyue's archon... what a fascinating god he is.
but inside a realm of consciousness, i exist independently of her. she cannot affect me in this way.
well? the things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
no... we're probably gonna need some time to digest all the... incredible information you've provided us.
well, there goes all our plans...
that's quick thinking, and very sound logic. aventurine is no fool. and working with him definitely has its dangers.
so i unwrapped it and found out it was a button, with a message on the back: "just press this button, and all of penacony will explode!" sounds terrifying!
as for that aventurine... welt, i'd like to hear your thoughts.
according to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
this might sound strange, but i actually don't know who's been helping me. i don't even know if they're a person or not.
welcome to reality. more specifically, the reverie, the safest and most familiar place you can be.
but madam faruzan, i don't want to fail...
there's no other grand theater in the dreamscape.
doesn't look too bad, how did you make it?
anyway. be gone. do not disturb my solitude.
never imagined that's how we'd end up getting past the guard... that trick of clockie's really is amazing.
*sigh* that's a long story... ever since he was little, vache had always wanted to develop a medicine called "blizzard immunity."
so, eric, why did they threaten you like that. what happened?
state your query. to the point.
(phew. the maison cardinalice has announced my accession, but this is my first time facing the people...)
sampo... are we there yet?
are you doing this on purpose!?
the story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. also, there are a great many legends about rex lapis. i'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
in some of my tournament matches, i could see my opponent's hands shaking, hesitant to play their cards. now that i think about it, perhaps they were scared of what would happen if they defeated me...
that statue... it wasn't here last time.
need someone to talk to, hmm? aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
...the auction, the one at the vagrant camp?
thus he became known as the father of penacony.
what? does he look like a crane to you?
what are you talking about? are you still half-asleep or something...? the order's dream is over.
serves them right! better luck next time, slowpokes!
wow! you won something on your first attempt! impressive!
that was some speech, bronya! if i had to talk like that in front of a huge crowd, i'd be shaking head to toe!
mister giovanni! i guess it's not that surprising...
serval, this dunn, do you know him?
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing...
hey, you're finally back!
don't worry, i'll be fine.
of course not! i spent the whole night reading the novel from cover to cover, marking sections that either need to omitted or adapted.
huh? there's a note here too. "take your fancy? there's a reward inside~"
it appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
...huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
huh? so that snowy planet is our destination this time?
it's the place in the photo alright. is this... a games parlor!? what kind of problem can they possibly be facing?
huh?! robin? but i thought she... oh, right! if firefly is here safe and sound, then it means robin must be okay, too.
so i told him about the express, and eventually he stopped crying and started asking so many questions.
only kids sit around like this, waiting for the stars to appear...
so, the children in the clinic heard the story of you and the express, and immediately insisted on sending a gift to the hero of belobog.
hmm... why don't you take a guess?
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
...are you done ordering? you... you have great taste! haha... i... i'll get the bill...
what a terrible waste... a gifted artist from humble beginnings, who achieved so much and no doubt had much more to give... and then her life was so cruelly taken.
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
precisely. now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the hydro archon, i order your arrest.
what? you want to help me with my thesis?
okay, now move the kamera slowly.
these words have been appearing and then vanishing persistently for awhile now. whose thoughts are they? and who is this mikhail...
when my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, i'll correct you. and if you're ever stuck in a rut, i'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
but don't keep your fungus waiting much longer... look, now that it's no longer under the wisdom orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
and it's likewise for me. i have a wish i want to achieve so badly in the real world, but i can't. so, i want to give it a shot here...
if you really hate each other, and can't reconcile your differences, then you could just call it quits now. why bother with a final performance if the group is already fractured?
huh? i--is that... dan heng!? you...
bronya, did you finish talking to oleg? hope he didn't make things difficult for you.
ah, you don't refuse. may i assume you accept then?
don't you guys have anything better to do!? what did we do this time?
umm, okay... i'll try to swim over there.
my, my... you look like a small injured animal. are you still willing to talk to me? of course... i'm still willing to be your psychotherapist.
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream... and tell mikhail our decision.
say no more. if you're sick, you need to rest. i know what you're going to ask.
"follow the hints i've left, and you will find the answer to your question."
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off...
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
that would be something of an oversimplification.
now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
the encounter at the dreamscape hotel was a sign.
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya...
since the physical body will eventually turn to dust, she replaced hers with that of a puppet.
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
boss, get me a plate of fried tofu! and get some kushikatsu for these two. just the basic kind will do.
(the king does not appear entirely aware of his surroundings. the man by his side, though... we should keep a close eye on him.)
leaving already? ah, and i was looking forward to playing a few more rounds with you.
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
indeed. then perhaps you could tell us everything that happened during that one minute.
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
well, the only appropriate response would be to say that i'm fine, right? i'm pale due to lack of sleep, not because of the fight...
i see. i'll be sure to remember that.
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
that's your big reveal? the important part is: we're from a different planet!
also, he's so cruel to his shroom buddies, when they could have been friends... it's not just his loss, either. it brings all the other contestants down.
(i doubt they'd ask about something so irrelevant!)
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
of course, that can't be undone now. it's too late, and i have no intention of reinventing myself all over again.
her handwriting here gets patchier and more illegible by the line... she probably didn't have much strength left.
nice to meet you too... hehe, you're very polite.
you're layla's friend, right? and from the looks of things, the two of you are preparing for her thesis defense?
oh, paimon, you're just as carefree and enthusiastic as ever. well, it's about time for me to get into character. as a contestant, i need to go and get ready for the tournament...
really? hehe, i don't know if you really mean it, but i'm happy to hear that.
it is... relying solely on what the seelie said might not be viable.
i'm not sure. everything happened so quickly. but regardless, the family must be hiding something -- something about the truth of the dreamscape...
...that's all i have to say. we do not discuss this matter again.
...uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy...
have you not sensed it yet? this apparent land of dreams... it's a carefully designed dream maintained by the family through unknown means.
what's... going on? i can't seem to remember... anything clearly. the only thing i know for sure is this prophecy... will it really come to pass?
i wasn't planning on saying anything... but i saw a couple of very sad-looking faces in the crowd.
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though...
...my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
you've been standing here for half an hour. it's rare to see you like this.
it really is her... miss robin!
just names and occupations? and they don't even sound like their real names either... this will be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
i see... i suppose that makes sense.
try to focus on that flower...
the pieces look like they flew to both sides of the room.
i see. yes, she's always had great analytical skills. it'd be nice if she was more confident, though.
okay, got it. she's at the museum -- let's get going.
so you admit it, then? you're not in this to save lives. you're in it to get rich.
huh... who's wilder? ...and what's "aetherium wars"?
don't take this the wrong way, but... doesn't the house of daena have a door?
we hardly saw any animals, let alone people.
recover those cherished recollections and enshrine them in a land of purity. in doing so, all will be preserved from true oblivion.
among the countless legends surrounding the house of daena, the wisdom seelie is one of the more popular ones lately...
oh, you mean the special patrol's musketeers?
you know what? time for some fieldwork. maybe the answers to our questions are waiting for us at the scene.
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
this is just a stage name... i guess?
"always watching over you. sincerely, the wisdom seelie."
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
please, the honor is all mine. i was profoundly moved to hear about your troupe and your wonderful director. i just wanted to do something to help.
nobody did, but it never hurts to be prepared!
the nameless -- those who trailblaze, doing good deeds but never seeking recognition. after all this time, how would we even find those three people in such a vast place like penacony?
i thought that the flow of time was the same on the inside and the outside. so it was a great shock to me when the traveler re-appeared.
no matter how disgusting the dish, you gotta summon your trailblazing spirit and face it! not gonna lie though, jellied eels and himeko's coffee are pretty tough to stomach...
things i want to do? let's see, where to start...
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
if we can get her to help us, we'll bag a stellaron in no time!
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details... well that's reassuring.
you can see the common traits of the erroneous samples on page three... ah, excuse me, i mean from the starlogs in the appendix.
serval, we're racing against the clock! no time for head-wrapping.
i came up with my name myself, but some people just call me march... which do you prefer?
i'm just kidding, of course. i'm sure fish have worries of their own. i'm quite content with how things are right now.
you should join us, chevreuse. you missed the first few hours of the party, didn't you?
can't wait to find out what's inside these victory zones!
belobog, here we come!
see? my takes on fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
this atmosphere really feels strange... are you sure topaz is here?
it has been forbidden. *sigh* please refrain from making me talk any further.
you are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity...
...don't you have anything nice to say!?
the crystals show at least six structures under differing conditions... "six-phased ice." the galaxy really is an enigma.
did we do something wrong? we really did save the luofu, so why do you want to sneak off like we're fugitives?
since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me ei. i'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
guess not. this house looks like it's in vimara village. does the seelie want us to go there?
in sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
just outside the mall is the plaza. follow me! i'll buy you a nice meal!
that may not sound like a huge difference to you. but it's helped me relax a lot... so don't worry about me.
wonderful. then i'll see you in three days. i look forward to it very much.
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
oh, so that's what happened! thank you, miss black swan.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
*whimper*... i can't go on... too weak...
and if teyvat is, in its entirety, a show on a stage, then you're just a "spectator," aren't you?
right! you finally get what we're all about. pretty cool, huh?
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
hmm... you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet...
woo! is that it? looks like we solved all the puzzles in this victory zone.
that's right. i'm surprised you understand it so well...
what? so is every person in teyvat who doesn't want money gathered here to shoot this film? don't tell me chiori isn't being paid either...
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
what's with you turning into a scaredy-cat? i didn't see you worrying about lawsuits when you wrecked that giant mech.
*sigh* forget it. i think our taste in nicknames is different.
he has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
oh, that's a good idea. a cup of coffee might help clear my head. let's go.
as far as i can tell, she's not a threat and seems to be telling the truth.
oh, um, i... i don't think that will be necessary...
what have you done with mister yang and miss robin?!
the fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise... they would have been purged long ago.
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
masters could handle them for sure! but isn't it asking too much of a poor little rookie like me?
yes, it's something really, really good, and i'm very thankful for it.
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
you may consider my previous "act" a door gift of sorts. i thought it was a debut that suited the atmosphere.
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
get going to where, mister yang?
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like... hair accessories or brooches?
true, but the story doesn't end there. that samurai's name was yanagibashi takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the souran isshin art.
my intention is to help people. i'm not here to cause any harm.
oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
let's go back to town. i still owe those patients an explanation...
if i'm lucky, maybe i can convince them to send extra medical supplies to the underworld.
we'll leave them be... svarog may have blocked off the furnace core, but he's provided shelter to the vagrants from the beginning. an admirable deed.
i've got lots! it's just, i don't know what to choose.
hold on, sir... we have documents authorized by the family that would aid your investigation. if it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this mister gallagher?
we have two possible leads right now. the first is the checkout logs of those two books, and the other is the red stamp.
if you must, seele. try not to worry... i don't want to see you two fighting.
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
...you think so? i actually think it's pretty snazzy.
huh? me again? it hurts, y'know!
yeah! alright, let's go! to the sleepless earl!
there are many homeless people in the underworld. if they had safety and security, they wouldn't have to struggle to survive.
...hey, it feels like it got a bit warmer!
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
i'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
hold on now. would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
i'm sorry, everyone. i could have done better in the third round...
i, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. approved.
to put it bluntly, it was constant torture with no end in sight.
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
and aren't human emotions -- love, hate, regret, and hope -- just the most mesmerizing things in this world?
i've been underground for so long, i already forgot what flowers smell like.
whew... you scared me for a moment there. i nearly thought we had lost everything...
one, do you have the evidence to back up your claims?
her name is sparkle, a masked fool who has infiltrated penacony... don't worry. she won't be bothering you for now. she's probably patting herself on the back for a job well done.
it's a long story...
come on, let's go. just think of it as... keeping me company for a while!
hehe, that's nice of you.
oh, really? then i won't disturb you.
automaton... stealth bomb?
hehe, don't worry. if he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
and now that the gods have given me their blessing... it actually feels more like i'm finally able to take my fate in my own hands.
when this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
"monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. what started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
hmm? whatever. let me ask you this, have you heard of any interesting new rumors lately? if so, i'd love to hear about them.
you're just here for the show!
his being yet again demonstrates that... there are those who, despite being offered countless choices, will always choose the same path.
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
as a guest from afar, there's no need to be so formal.
hmm, a most opportune outcome.
i'd rather not play around. we don't have very much time.
i will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, i need you to do two things:
wait, we still haven't doused the burners!
maybe you can just stay behind this time, mister yang...?
this is not the fatal flaw in your adventure. take your time and think it through.
it's a... warp trotter?
um, no need. i'll handle the clinic. i assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
no... we shouldn't... i think we should agree to the meeting.
okay, i'll do my best! it's the least i can do considering everything you've already done for me.
ugh, no no no... i gotta stop worrying so much about everything! the whole point of me taking a vacation was to come here and relax.
right. especially with someone outside of the shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
think about it, is the entrance to your own home that hard to get through?
...yeah. so what?
...hold on... if the watchmaker really was a nameless, wouldn't that make him your predecessor? would you like to take a picture with him?
the sparkle murder case? wasn't the victim shamari from the ipc?
with this last cup of tea, let us honor the tea master's memory.
you and origami bird are friends?
so, miss topaz, what exactly will it take for the ipc to go easier on belobog?
so the one in this photo... are you sure it isn't me?
let's leave it there, shall we? work hard, now, hehe...
"consider the effort you put into thinking and searching as your payment for my knowledge."
beautiful! great performance!
so this is all aurelie left behind... just whatever she was carrying on her person, and this tattered old notebook.
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
she clearly not a pathstrider of the hunt. but you are, aren't you? tell me, what's acheron's deal?
in a way, i suppose i am... i have no idea what to do about my thesis.
countless shooting stars streak the sky tonight... if you can pick the right one, it will carry your wish to thousands of distant worlds.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
...dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past... if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
ha, i knew she was weird...
whew... i'm assuming we've finally reached the end of the script?
...i, um... i haven't been truthful with you...
casual... how about this? this feels quite natural.
you... aren't hiding anything, are you?
imagine launching a surprise attack when your enemy is fast asleep. the cheek!
this doesn't count as trying to avoid my problems, does it?
wait. i thought hallucinations were supposed to be completely random? why did i see an identical me?
ah... wh--why are you looking at me? i had nothing to do with it...
well, guess i'll keep it then!
...*sigh* we need to work on your emotional intelligence.
hehe, that settles it, then. now, there are already a few visitors at the shrine. make sure you take good care of them.
...so that's why you slept for so long.
no problem. just think of it as my greeting gift for little klee.
all manner of signs indicate that the prophecy will still come to pass... forget it, that's not something you need to worry about right now.
when i stand aboard the express, i can feel that you and i are really the same -- manifesting our own futures in this universe to the best of our abilities.
okay... where to next?
is this what it means... to reminisce?
no way! not even close!
...and then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. you won't be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.
mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
"the stars exploded, and the express has to go everywhere to pick up all the pieces, and that's why it flies up in the sky."
*yawn* well, here we are. i feel sleepy already.
i don't believe you... you're hiding something from me, it's written all over your face.
that... is something i agree on.
which means they were definitely here, right?
hearing you speak, it sounds as if your voice has made somewhat of a recovery.
ugh...
...the tea party turned out to be even more difficult than i'd imagined...
fine, give me a piece of your mind if you want! i admit it. i was kinda out of line...
...just as expected.
b--bronya? you're here just in time! things were about to get out of control!
the guide miss topaz mentioned could have important information for us.
dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. you make it sound like i'm some sort of wicked witch.
only fifteen days? alright... fine!
will you be staying here for a while? or are you going to check on the other contestants?
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
though i occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it -- i can't exactly avoid seeing it at the grand narukami shrine, after all -- my fate is intimately intertwined with the sacred sakura.
...a phone? want to listen in?
this notice... seems like a hint for us from miss sparkle.
and you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. hehehe...
you're right, so we should let go of the past. i suppose this is also a part of growing up.
don't let small things get in the way of your friendship.
dear audience, the performance is experiencing a technical difficulty, but worry not! the guards shall resolve it soon enough!
this body has no need of rest. but i am an assistant to the one within. if she wishes to rest, i must follow her will.
what you might not realize is that all too often... people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
oh, you mean that they got the incantation from that book. yes, i know the one.
but you are miserable, because you don't have a life of your own...
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me... i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey...
allow me to introduce furuyama. he is a tea master and a member of my retinue.
hehe... regardless, please do look after me while i'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do...
oh, it's you... it looks like the conflict is over for now. thank goodness, if the numbers of wounded had kept climbing, i don't know what we'd have done. if only he'd have been here...
i promise i don't mean any harm, and i'll answer all your questions. but before that, would you mind telling me who you are first?
does not a single person dare to face me?
oh yeah? well, since you think it's so easy, you can sign them for me.
for all i know, i could even be the seelie. but... what if i am?
i hope that by the end of this journey... everyone will have achieved the outcome that they hoped for.
how should i put this... there's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
wait, you're saying no one has put a plan in place to distribute supplies or maintain order?
oh, i'm sorry... it's just that i'm really excited. this is the first time this has happened, really! i'm so happy.
huh? what's this about winning something?
the rules still stand. these little ones won the tournament and passed the ultimate trial, which means they'll be taking elchingen and kautilya's place.
...hey sleepyhead, looks like you're awake.
well, if you're not into it, could you at least keep me company...? pleeeease! it's not like we get to celebrate these kinds of festivals every day...
these should be enough to get by for a bit longer. be careful. don't push yourselves too hard.
not so long ago, i was still wondering whether i'd ever see belobog's sky again. now, i'm on a train coasting through the universe...
hey, enough with the passive aggression!
indeed. countless monsters suddenly appeared throughout all of inazuma. in the end... kitsune saiguu sacrificed her life to protect the people.
and... you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
that's two down already! but seriously, i can't help but notice how... confusing this place is...
i have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. i'm sure she was as happy as can be.
wh--whoa! quick, look!
i am rather curious about you, though. why are you trying to help her?
is that also part of the script?
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
absolutely! i wield my sword to become a hero! i want to fight for justice, punish the wicked, and make them quiver in fear and run away when they see me!
i told you, it's purely out of a spirit of competitiveness.
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
how about a divination?
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
not bad at all. i'm glad you finally got to reveal the tricks you've been keeping up your sleeve.
do you not know how to wield a blade...? or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
alright, this one's done! let's go find the next lamp~
...yeah, i really like them, so what.
the result... patients with mild illness would attribute their recovery to the so-called wonder medicine, while patients with serious illness would quickly deteriorate... and sometimes die.
are you talking to clockie? ..well, it does look like things are getting out of control...
it's fine, it matters not. what's done is done...
okay, alright. got it.
that won't be necessary. i remember it all.
come back, come back, they won't be hiding that far away!
if we keep going, we'll reach glaux avenue, which is the road to golden hour.
the discomfort i was experiencing earlier was caused by the shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
if i am not mistaken, what we just saw was a samurai's memory that was buried in the land.
don't worry, welt and himeko will have our backs if things go wrong. let's just make the most of it all while we're here.
i want to watch them blossom and wither, see them refined on the page, retold on the stage, and remembered long into the future.
i'll be sure to ask some people i know to see if they'd be willing to act as extras.
i am sorry. it is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
looks like she also sent you a message...
as i said, i need to think about inazuma's eternity. and thinking takes time.
she might feel like everything she's ever worked for is pointless, and that could lead to some demoralizing thoughts.
anyway, people seem to be behaving in a very orderly fashion. i don't see the liveliness you spoke of anywhere.
you shouldn't indulge her, outsider. uh-uh, i know it's difficult to tell hook "no," but sometimes it just has to be done.
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
i must be prepared for anything. if there are more formidable monsters lying in wait in this area, i must make sure i have the strength to face them.
in that instant before it killed me, i saw the reflection of another dreamscape in those ghastly pupils.
...actually, i was wondering if diviner fu could do me a favor.
the omamori from the grand narukami shrine are very potent indeed. i thought i'd put one aside for you.
i'm guessing the patients you met weren't exactly singing my praises, which is why you tracked the dealer down and made inquiries first.
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
a threatening letter? what are you even talking about?
the harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. the family takes them in, but they... don't belong here.
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
let's continue with the plan. can you help me with a rehearsal of my thesis defense? we can do that at the house of daena.
the storage room... it's behind the shelves, right?
those kids better not have taken advantage of the chaos to go on an expedition.
any clear evidence of my existence would only hinder my ability to conceal my identity. it would also expose me to layla as well.
but those things... are all in the past.
haha, i'm just hoping for the best! you're the one jinxing us!
the story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. and the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. approved!
i'm afraid you have no idea how much she suffered that month.
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
this grand theater looks totally different... is this the power of the order?
anyway, are you scared, little friend? don't you worry, now, it'll be over soon. just think of it like having a dream.
she... is she running? no... running away? something's right behind her...
therefore... i shall allow you to leave tenshukaku alive
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means...
she's always bragging to me about it, but it's difficult for me to really imagine without seeing the place for myself. can you take me there?
we're finally here. the entrance should be nearby...
since then, every time i encounter an obstacle in my thinking, i find myself having the urge to spend some time in the outside world.
it's a cinch. this music box -- the "invitation" received by the annihilation gang... there are latent memories that linger on it yet.
i'm sorry... *sigh* i always find myself having to apologize.
where did you come from little one? is your dad around?
it's just a minor error. this kind of thing was bound to happen. a small modification to the shogun should fix it.
he cut you off completely! this guy...
from what i've seen, the residents are nearly all miners. it seems like the people here have less than those in the overworld.
the stellaron issue concerns the life and death of everyone on penacony. if anyone has a better suggestion, the crew is more than willing to listen. also, it'd be best to tell us the ins and outs of that meeting--
hehe, you are the one who's been acting like a child from the very beginning.
um... i'm still not sure i understand, but... i'll try. i'll try to do this.
are you okay? can you hear me? i didn't hear a peep from your room, and it really freaked me out.
we must remove all those who stand in our way.
hey, don't rush her! so sorry, miss jingyan, they can be a little impatient. take your time, we can wait.
but that's completely unreasonable!
elio can see his own future, and i can also "see" mine. he says that there is only one kind of destiny, but before i reach mine, i want to know what else i can do... this is my right.
this way... this is where we part ways. all of this is like... a nightmare.
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me...
...wait, we haven't been thrown into prison yet, have we?
hey, whose side are you on!? i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides...
she hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
it's not my fault that i'm super popular! what was that saying again? my popularity has--
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile... we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
you wouldn't understand! all cute things in the world should share a mutual affinity!
it's not hiding somewhere and spying on me, is it? oh, that's a scary thought...
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate... ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
best future? best for who? as if you'd consider anyone but yourself.
that's right! any idea where we can give it a spin?
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person...
i have heard about the thunderstorm, though. as to the cause, it is not inconceivable that, as you suggest, her will has wavered somewhat.
...as you can see, i lack confidence no matter what i do, there's always something worrying me.
hehe... thanks to both of you for understanding.
when exploring opportunities, one such as he, a gambler, will never reject your overtures. gratify his whims, but also keep your defenses up.
um... where's he? i can't see him...
i vote monsters. that's the main duty of the hunters, right? we can come back to the sorcerer later.
as i said, the shogun has a robust system to protect her against modification. this is because i anticipated that i myself would change over time.
don't try and get me to cook. i can take care of anything else, but not that.
and you didn't hear anything else at all? nothing that might leave an impression of any kind?
the defeat was a heavy blow to her. it also didn't help that i forgot to bring her some tricolor dango and light novels when i went to see her...
wh--what was that... did something happen to pom-pom!?
we're probably getting close now. let's search this area.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them...
excuse me, is the deputy sheriff still around?
i knew it'd be harder than i had expected.
please, come to your senses! i'm begging you...
so, you were saying -- "the little oceanid"...?
alright, let's take them all down.
well, don't mind me. find a place to sit down and buckle up.
other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. a little bit of this, little bit of that...
(oh dear, what do i do? even i think they sound convincing now! have i falsely accused an innocent person? ugh, what a humiliation...)
yes... initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
half an amber era ago, the family held an unprecedented festival there, and after that... everyone on the planet became part of the family.
(hmm, no, there doesn't seem to be any notable connection between these two pieces of information.)
well, see you all some other time! toodle-oo!
ah... i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises...
or... did you want to hear some family flower stories?
it was still being set up when i was there earlier, but i assume it should be ready soon.
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
it's pouring out here! wait, the water levels aren't rising, are they?
phew...that was scary, it just suddenly attacked!
in the end, oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the underworld.
yeah... feels like we're missing something...
i need some more time to prepare myself...
uh... you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence...
hehe, if it isn't the leader of watatsumi island, who looks as soft as a jellyfish, but whose words sting like one, too.
it's not that i "know everything." it's just that i've been in your position before.
how fascinating... you must be full of secrets. there's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
...but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
we are just friends, i don't see what sheltering has to do with it. tell your subordinates to leave, we have things to discuss.
yeah, our goal is the same as yours, serval's, and bronya's -- we just want to preserve this world! there's no reason to turn against each other!
uhh... i have no idea how to respond to that...
got it, seele. we'll do what we can to help bronya out.
aha, so that's how it's done.
it somehow makes me feel a little... lonely.
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
can't sleep? let's go for a walk then.
hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in inazuma. they even handed out flyers in front of yae publishing house.
i can't think of any connection i have with vimara village, though. i've only been there once, and it was pretty uneventful.
how's it going, my little layla? have you been teaching your opponents a lesson?
whew, i think i might've overexerted myself though... i'm flagging hard. let's go see miss yae before i crash ...
no, i have nothing to share with you at this time. but you... you use elemental energy without the aid of a vision. how is this possible? please enlighten me.
he certainly has a beautiful tail. although... mine's a little softer.
also, if our clapper loader could avoid shouting at the start of the scene next time...
ahahahahahaha, oh, urakusai, you haven't changed a bit. you caught on so quickly. too perfect.
bring it on! let's see how i beat you this time!
i see, let's give it a shot! who says we have to rely purely on swordplay to beat him?
hey, is it just me or is the snowfall getting heavier?
general jing yuan?
i'm really not accustomed to using a vision. why don't you teach me? ah, i nearly forgot... you've never used a vision either.
no matter how conclusive the evidence is or how perfect our reasoning may be, nothing will happen as long as i'm awake.
it was at once a familiar feeling and a strange one... makoto barely wielded a blade in her life, and yet her blade brings me closer to her.
if you don't take the payment now, i'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the arataki gang.
but even the gods of other lands, hehehe...
uh, hello? is anyone home?
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
what's wrong? are you not feeling well?
it may also be that miss firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
now that i've benefited from your experience, i'll try to follow your instructions the next time i'm attempting optimizations on the shogun.
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
"those who are willing to give up freedom for security will end up with neither."
hmm... maybe he dyed his hair!
i do. i once had nothing but the truth, and now, i'm finally free to live my own life again. and even though i have no idea where i'm going right now...
well... i might be totally off base here, but i think there's something fishy with this tv.
okay. next, i will show you a secret kitsune spell. this painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means i'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
let's call it a day. thank you for cleaning up the mess my brother left behind. here -- for your trouble.
i always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food... hmm? you'd like to see me do that? hah! i'm sure you would.
a planet covered in snow and ice... will i find my answer here...?
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
i've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near fountain plaza. don't worry, i know my way around the administrative district.
yeah, it almost makes the blessing feel like it was just a tool used for my studies, no?
hehe, perhaps... or you could take the view that she's acting like a little child, throwing a temper tantrum and locking herself in her room. don't you think?
finally, i can get some good sleep...
please take dulphy back to her place to rest. i'll sing the finale.
yeah. it takes time for friends to get to know each other properly, and come to trust each other.
it's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. the desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
yeah... but he really doesn't seem like a bad guy.
looking forward to your reply. yours, march seventh.
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
this time, the gloves are off!
seriously? can't you just tell all of us?
come, this way -- it's a short walk. don't get lost.
the great mine's just down here. the ipc should have the venue all sorted by now.
descendant of the takatsukasa clan. explain what is going on here.
is this the moment miss yae said we were waiting for...?
you believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. thus, you believe your present self is correct. don't you?
i'm gonna... get back on my feet, and keep moving forward.
...so, my intuition was correct.
plus, this is the family's turf. teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
...there it is -- it's hazy, but it's ifrit's voice. the other one... is probably his progeny.
is this... the lower level of the commercial district?
the thunderstorm is getting out of control? this is the first i've heard of it.
the atmosphere in this room feels totally different.
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now...
the ipc soldiers are well-equipped -- it wouldn't be wise to fight them head-on. captain, what do you have in mind?
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
that's right... though i didn't intend for it to turn out this way, really. i just wanted to help out a few other classmates who were having a hard time while i was helping layla finish her thesis.
it's all about the bartender's pride. it wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. that's the mindset i use when i brew my coffee.
how does the saying go? "trouble comes in pairs"...
thanks for introducing yourself, mister giovanni di... something something...
i'm j--just a little too tired to walk right now... but i still need to find three more shroom buddies to qualify for the tournament...
but before that moment arrives, we can still choose what we do... we all have this right, don't we?
with the help of the sacred sakura's power, i was finally able to overcome the monsters and quell the disaster in inazuma.
now, if i only had a bottle of sake, that would make it perfect.
well then, we shall oblige.
this was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
it's not only the monsters that i am worried about. i'm concerned about what else might escape from the sacred sakura.
ugh, read the room! enough with the mean jokes!
i could do with a cup once we're done here...
whew... who'd have thought just taking a stroll could be so tiring?
you wouldn't be wrong for thinking that... i don't sleep much, so i get light-headed pretty often.
the present situation is... we're here! this planet isn't doomed after all...
hehe. i don't mean to belittle them. on the contrary...
the right to punish inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. not yours, signora.
i owe you a big one! if it hadn't been for you, i might have been... taken away by them.
goodness, what's all the commotion over here? discussing something interesting behind my back?
it's my honor to meet you, general huaiyan...
the sacred sakura can absorb and purify the filth in the ley lines. after the rifthounds attacked, some of this filth leaked out through the cracks in the trunk and formed a physical entity.
no worries, i hope things go smoothly.
hmm... quite impressive.
urakusai, how much time do you have left?
the snow is sparkling. just like the stars in the night sky.
wait, wait! master diviner, can you divine our fortunes for us? is there anything we need to watch out for?
this is your hard-earned money. looking after a bookshop is no easy task.
hehe. that's good.
another wubbaboo! it's definitely holding onto another pass!
remember when we entered the hotel in the dreamscape for the first time, and i procured a few trinkets from your companions? their functions are similar.
i once had informants all over teyvat, searching for clues and feeding information back to me.
*sigh* but, there's no point in me studying at the akademiya if i keep relying on this mysterious phenomenon...
i don't know what grudges they have... but this path is a dead end, too.
stripped of ambitions, stripped of the potential for change, it does nothing more than simply... exist. it is a hollow shell of a nation.
i see. yes, this is an important relationship, so he must choose wisely, but the decision-making process is a source of agony and conflict.
(what a heavy beginning for a life story...)
so... could the author not simply add a narrative device whereby the main character could accept the feelings of all seven admirers at once? yes, that would solve it!
you remember rivet town? when the fragmentum corrosion first appeared, we were defenseless. we didn't have a clue how to protect our homes.
yes, this is it! thank you so much!
you can see us as... kindhearted interstellar public servants, lending a helping hand to any world affected by a stellaron!
even after we found out about his mysterious past, he's still the same dan heng we've always known!
presumably... miss sparkle is now carefully arranging the next crime scene, right?
ahem. o--no--de--ra?
denied. use of force has been forbidden.
so... you're also saying the guards want to work with wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
i've tried all kinds of ways, too, to hold back the sea. anything to keep the coastline from advancing...
well hello there, little one. oh? i see you've brought a special guest.
from before the memory loss, before the express...
what if i told you it was a secret art from the grand narukami shrine, and that i had the balladeer down on his knees begging for mercy in an instant... would you believe me?
why, i wouldn't miss it for the world -- seeing as you put so much work into everything.
let me take a look. maybe there's something in here from after she was kidnapped...
take it... *sigh* go on, you have my approval!
the quarterfinals are coming up. to me, this is the most important round... i'm a little nervous, but let's all do our best!
yeah, exactly... uhm, are you being sarcastic?
i bet the antimatter legion forces never thought they'd be swallowed up by the eternal freeze when they invaded this world.
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said... if you need something from us, just say the word.
uh... not the kind of waves that drown everyone, i mean the good kind of waves...
now, then... i can't really help her prepare for the thesis defense, so i'll be leaving some notes behind instead. you'll have to give them to her later.
hmm? whatever are you talking about? i don't understand. i'm simply here for the book review session with miss sole of the deep.
hey! d--don't scare me! i'm sure there's a scientific explanation for this, right?
come on belobog... don't let me down.
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. but what about the long-term?
alright, it's about time to head back. pauleau should have finished the ending by now.
did you get enough sleep? if you're still tired, you should go back to sleep for a bit... me? *sigh* i'm... used to it...
the problem is... i'm also planning to visit the almighty merchant at seven in the morning tomorrow to buy all the ingredients i need...
my "origin," huh... i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
k--keep watch? are we space cowboys now? i guess this is the cosmic wild west.
is that me!? wh--what's she saying...
wait, miss tingyun, why are you still here!? you're too close to the crucible!
it is because they're afraid to wake up from the dream.
the kitchen knife and spices supreme... i think i heard about that store before -- over in exalting sanctum.
even if i was gonna release it back into the sky, it'd have to be strong enough to fly first. if i left it where i found it... i fear it'd never get the chance to fly ever again.
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
through her love for her human partner, she was able to find an even greater love -- one that extended to all of humanity. surely the biggest strength of clio's character.
are these puppets part of the stage setup? even so, it's so eerie that the entire front hall is empty.
if i don't end up staying at the akademiya after graduation, i think i'll come travel the world with you. what do you think?
alrighty then, let's take this little fella with us to the festival! now, i think it's time we came up with a catchy name for them...
that oleg... he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
while i want to live, i'm never afraid of death. the opposite of death is eternal life, and that's... something i'll never desire.
the philosophy of life that he shared with us just now, that was makoto's view on reality. she always saw things that way.
of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
ah, my little friends, there you are.
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
however, the weather was rainy every single day after i borrowed it, and i was unable to compare the night sky against the celestial globe.
...just tell her already! we come from a different planet!
...someone's been following you.
and these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
but... how will i do this? a human assuming the role of a god without being exposed...
ah, you see... her emotions are incredibly unstable. she's constantly doubting herself.
well, she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products...
huh... him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
executed...? we barely did anything!
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
at first, i just felt bad about rejecting them, so i wanted to learn a little bit more about their situation. but one thing led to another, and... well, here we are.
too ordinary! hmph, such an uninspired dish will never have my approval!
even among the fools i know, miss sparkle's sense of humor stands out from the rest.
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara... we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully...
anyway, thank you for the info. i'll be sure to take note of everything you mentioned.
what i'm working on now is the research and prediction of the triple-orbit shift phenomenon.
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
if i don't do this, the shogun's rules can never change, and inazuma can never move forward.
hey, do you think this could be related to the seals?
i wonder what silver wolf did to my sword. can i really defeat skott?
*sigh* but there's nothing else we can do. it's the one holding all the cards... it's completely hidden and can choose whether to help us or not.
it's not the answer that's important, but what we can learn from others' answers... right?
that's just called never giving up! hehe~
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes... truly are sorrowful.
blocked the road does stand, such is our hunters' plight, yet with sword and courage in hand, they march forth to pierce the night.
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
that's enough for now. i'll say this one last time, hook: if you cause any trouble again, i'll take diggertron away. do you understand?
because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
whew... that was tough!
"because i am an older sister to them."
"ahh, i can't go back anymore," and other similar thoughts started to come to mind... i guess i'm still not used to being in the akademiya yet.
i see... but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
whoa! why are you here!? ...and how did you get here before us?
seems like someone wasn't paying attention!
thus, the gnosis became not only useless, but also a potential source of conflict.
please stop... the more you talk about it, the more silly i feel...
i can, however, provide some artistic guidance from the vantage point of a highly experienced audience member.
but from now on, i want to spend my time learning real stories about real people, and how they touch the lives of others around them.
so now, i've understood the meaning of my second "death", and i am prepared to face it. if all goes well, my efforts will provide crucial support for you.
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
whoa! you're awesome, mister tail!
just kidding, how could that be possible?
still, i'm looking forward to the day i can join the crew. i'd like to see how other civilizations fight diseases and what belobog could learn.
no one questioned it, and yet its presence contrasted so starkly with the area as i remembered it... it seemed as if i was the only one to have noticed it appear suddenly out of thin air.
aventurine? is he still alive...? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
thank you all very much. i promise you that i will create a bright future for inazuma.
(hey! that's not the right thing to say... you managed to stir up this guy's sense of pride)
don't you realize how special you are? remember, the plane of euthymia is a space where only she is allowed to exist. the fact that you could appear there tells us one crucial thing:
that's wonderful. i'll be looking forward to your cooking during our adventures together.
it seems like i've underestimated the popularity of this game. hmm... i suppose this calls for a few more volumes of "king of invokations"...
wait. hold on a sec. this is the first time i'm hearing about this "certain person"... who are you chasing, and why would that lead you to the express?
rest...? but my deadline's just around the corner. i don't think i can afford to rest right now...
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the grand narukami shrine?
hey, if anything, shouldn't i be more grand and delightful in your dreams!? we've been through so much together and that's how your brain remembers me?
i'm no appraiser, but these two gems look to be high quality.
oh? and how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
let's go for one more round in the administrative district! i wanna take more photos!
in your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again...
who are you? a--and wh--what are you trying to do? please don't kill me, i'm begging you, please...
yes. the youkai called their celebration the "mikawa flower festival." makoto and i attended it once... she found it particularly fascinating.
okay, okay, that's enough of that. let's go and find julian.
...once you've tasted freedom, it's difficult to accept a life of separation and isolation. those of us whose childhoods were marred by tragedy... we must strive to do better for the next generation.
all of this is thanks to makoto's power. her understanding of eternity is much more profound than mine.
this is what makes ena's dream so powerful. in this paradise governed by the order, everyone indulges in their delightful dreams and lives happily ever after.
the want to escape may be innate in the weak, but whether they are weak or not... it is not up to another to decide.
and that's why i wanted to call the kind person who's always helping me as the "blessing from the stars."
*sigh* this must be the overflow of hydro from my person! well, can't quite help being the god whose dominion is the waters, can i?
i never would've guessed that gepard and you were brother and sister.
ahem, i... i mean, i appreciate the compliments... but what's with the flattery all of a sudden?
because other than me, there's only one person left.
pfft! as if anyone would ever believe that!
(okay, calm down layla. i know the info's all over the place, but you can definitely do it.)
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
alright everyone, we've got a wrap for tulipe and iris!
himeko! wait, is that the real you or a hologram!?
this enemy is completely different! if i didn't know it was a product of the fragmentum, i'd think we were fighting a human!
no, the prototype was merely a proof of concept. its appearance and intellect were not based on ei. it was a test.
hey, now that you mention it, that actually makes sense!
...so the truth is clear now, right?
i don't know. it's just something that suddenly occurred to me.
once you've understood her situation, come back and tell me what you think. after that... i want to ask for your help again.
you did quite admirably. i could see your determination and your hard work.
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
...allow me. relax, you'll be fine.
but i was too young to know what long-term frustration could do to a person. it changed him in a terrible way...
i'm really sorry, but i have to leave for a short while... death still hovers about, and i must personally ensure miss himeko and miss march seventh's safety, and warn them...
...there's no need to knock us out this time, right?
don't worry, little layla. they're just apologizing to me for defeating souka. go buy yourself a nice drink, take a break, and catch your breath.
you see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. the nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don't want to face will never come.
...it's not like that. you're making this too complicated...
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya...
hehe, now we're talking like a serious acting troupe!
a compliment!? continue...
but you can trust her, even with your life. stick around a bit longer and you'll see what i mean.
...it's okay. thanks.
i'm sure some people here see the idea of someone coming to poisson dressed as the hydro archon as extremely disrespectful.
this is my duty. no matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... and no matter how many times we must fight, i will defeat her.
...do you have a driver's license?
this old man's words... always catch me off guard.
she's hacked into the speakers!
now they are towering obstacles that i have no choice but to overcome.
oh? well what did you want to ask?
well then that's as good as nothing for now... so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one...
nothing? i thought there was an answer for every single permutation.
it's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that i'm used to.
it sure is... but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
thanks. hmm... oh, how about i share some basics about astrology with you? if you're interested, that is.
unbelievable... how could all these problems happen in just one day?
seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker -- she takes decisive action. she'll definitely be able to help you. not to mention... you also have bronya now.
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
we've collected all three passes now -- that should mean we've solved all the puzzles in the victory zone.
(no, that's pu'er, the tea society's gatekeeper.)
yikes! they scared the life out of me! why are there so many... puppets at the ticket office?
before the second round, he had a chat with the other me. he said that worries can be like illnesses -- they don't always have a magic cure. sometimes, you just have to endure them as best you can until they run their course.
that's... probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
y'know, it's funny how the "rules" always seem to work in your favor, don't you think? this world's been hanging by a thread and now you're here to pull the plug on it!
of course, it would have been more stressful for shingo and youhei that way, hehe. still, the experience may ultimately have been more effective than me scaring them into submission with a little exaggeration.
i wouldn't call it a shortcut if there was.
i see gertie! but who's that lying on the ground?
yikes! so serious! i was just curious.
as the one who shook eternity, you are her potential for change.
the pleasure is all mine, "sole of the deep."
i had heard that the kujou clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the tenryou commission. the search for a successor to the role of tenryou commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency...
huh, what's all the commotion about?
all in black, surely they're not... ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
isn't it dangerous for them to make camp right under svarog's metal nose?
and so... it falls to me to place the truth before your eyes, in all its ugliness.
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
the vision hunt decree was obviously devised as a means of manipulating the shogun, the ones behind it knowing full well her susceptibility as a puppet with a single-minded focus on eternity.
i... i dunno. she's being a little creepy...
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously... well, at least we finally get to go through...
from this day forth, this body will remain your assistant.
could it be the express? it looks like it'll get to the platform before us.
if it cannot be avoided, then...
eh... huh? hahaha, really now? i didn't even notice.
but... my past isn't something i'm constantly thinking about. i have plenty of other dreams...
*panting* phew... i'm so tired... i totally thought they had caught me...
...they'll remember him as a murderer... as someone whose evil experiments brought great harm to the innocent. vache doesn't deserve to be remembered as a "doctor." i know that very well.
traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
yes. that soldier was one of the many thousands who made the ultimate sacrifice. what he was describing just now was precisely the disaster that happened in inazuma five hundred years ago.
easy, girl. i'm on your side.
hah! hahahaha...
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
that's quite a stash! not sure if it's enough...
don't worry about it. like they told me after announcing my name during the curtain call -- everyone's work deserves recognition.
but that can wait... judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
uh... thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
"hello, layla. it must've been quite the endeavor to follow the seelie's hints all the way here. great work."
the universe is vast, and our lives are but specks. the trailblaze never ends, but against the backdrop of the cosmos, the average person's lifelong journey is merely a short stretch.
if fate turns that page, our paths will cross again.
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
i still remember the question on the invitation letter -- why does life slumber?
so, you're the watchmaker himself?
...dad? i was wondering where he is. is he...
kamisato... one of the most distinguished clans in all of inazuma. despite ayato's trickery in regard to the tri-commission's affairs, he is nevertheless a loyal subject. his past misdeeds shall be excused.
i understand! in the immersia, the disciple and the master share both honor and disgrace. if the apprentice fails, the master loses face, too.
i am no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis. in which case, there is no further need to keep the nation under lock and key.
the protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. sounds interesting. approved!
that's more like it! as expected, my dazzling side comes through in any situation.
we've only met once. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
that's the kind of person she is.
hey, not everything can be solved with food!
huh? that's not because of hunger...
i'll find a way to dispose of vache's leftover reagents. next time the "mutual aid society" wants to whip up a quack cure? they'll be out of luck.
seems like it, but "jade abacus" does sound a lot better.
but we would always get yelled at by the grown-ups if they caught us sneaking into the river to catch fish.
"also?" hmm... i suppose it makes sense that we're not the only ones investigating such a popular legend.
it's okay, i understand. you must have some important things on your plate? don't let them get ahead of you.
this marks the end of the thrilling journey in penacony. i'm sure you've already noticed something unusual, haven't you?
is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
it's been over a decade since the silvermane guards withdrew from the underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. the only contact we have is the exchange of geomarrow for goods.
perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
...of course, i don't know the whole story behind why the architects ordered the lockdown. who knows, thanks to you, they might finally be about to lift it... something that wildfire's wanted to achieve for a long time now.
she had their utmost trust, admiration, and love... and she truly deserved it.
if you lie to us, we'll be back!
sorry, i don't usually get this emotional... how have you been, mister oswell? thank you so much for taking care of my parents these last ten years.
nope, won't fit... better try another.
i do as she wishes. i can say no more than this.
still, the miners watch fights in their spare time. it's less pretentious than that theater they have on the surface.
look how far we've come! don't chicken out on us now.
these are all... charred remains?
because i trust you! even if my masters have doubts, they'll trust your judgment!
then next time i'm back in belobog i'll tell them i boarded the express, and i'm sure they'll give me a hundred different explanations of how it happened...
i guess aurelie must have written all of this down in the hope that her records would one day be of use to investigators.
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
seems like my subconscious mind has no talent for screenwriting.
anyway, if you're trying to bully this young lady, you'd better watch out for the weapon in my hand!
hey, that's not very polite~
this is just the worst-case scenario. but think about it: if the mastermind behind all this is nearby, why would he let us look around freely? unless...
mm-hmm. the object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the gnosis... and the prototype puppet is now known as "the balladeer."
hehehe... okay, i'll stop. now, a question for you. traveler, what is your ambition?
h-hey! that's not what i meant! i'm all for some fun... i just hope there won't be any surprise party crashers like friday or saturday.
human beings really are conflicted life forms...
i never thought... you'd use that kind of rhetoric against me...
we told pom-pom all about our adventure, and... they suddenly started crying... i've never seen pom-pom so sad before...
huh!? so these are rooftops? how long would snow have to fall to get this thick?
but you never mentioned this to me...
mister assistant detective, please feel free to point out a suspect as the murderer.
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract... goes against everything the nameless are about.
there's no shortage of surprises in life.
brother and sister landau...? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be...
well, i did, which is why...
general, are you... okay?
hmm, let me see... our next stop should be the cloudford victory zone!
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
this seems like the best spot to do this. we'll need to be quiet so we don't disturb anyone.
phew... so are we all good here, or what?
why do i wield my sword...? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
i didn't mean there's anything wrong with this place. that's not what i'm trying to say at all!
as her erstwhile closest friend... ei handed it over to me, and i've kept it in the grand narukami shrine ever since.
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know...
it's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. but in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
hmm... what kind of dessert should i try next?
i can't believe that happened to miss robin... "the strong defending the weak" is a great mantra, but if i had to pay such a price... i, i don't know what i'd do...
just think of that soldier. despite all the losses he had experienced, he still chose to keep fighting, for the sake of moving forward.
...what now? what are your plans?
you'd better be careful. don't get too close to blitzara when you're knee-deep in the water, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a very unique lower-leg massage.
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
thanks to their guidance, i've actually made some progress. when i get back to the express, i'll definitely show off my skills and impress you all!
something that mom isn't supposed to know?
(i just... don't know when these days will end...)
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
thank you, miss topaz. we're on our way to the hounds to verify some intel. perhaps you've had dealings with them?
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
perhaps they're about to find the last disruptor. ...also, speaking of kaveh, he's an interesting one.
she shuts herself off in her inner world, leaving all the affairs of the outside world to be dealt with by a puppet who has a singular focus on the pursuit of eternity...
i just wanted to chat with everyone to see if we could work together, but now, it appears my suggestion could be the very lifeline that saves everyone.
then... i ran away. i scrambled towards sumeru city looking for help.
why don't we try using the lamps' heat-transferring properties?
haha, i can't deny that my hobbies had no part to play in this. however, regardless of whether it's light novels or a festival, catching people's attention with a fresh concept is the essence here.
oh? you recognized me right away. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
it's ironic to think that in my whole time as a "god," i could only ever dream of receiving this kind of power...
that kid puts up a strong front, but under the surface he's afraid of becoming a burden -- that's why he trains and fights so hard... i hope one day he's able to slow down and listen to his heart.
i hope you really give this a good shot, you and haniyyah. the future of this highly entertaining tournament depends on the decisions you make from now on... i'm excited to see what you've got in store for us.
oh? surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means... but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
you'd make sure that i didn't notice anything amiss, before revealing yourself as my prosecutor once we'd arrived onto the stage...
the venue is right over there. why not go and take a walk around? oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.
of course i want to live on, but... what fate owes me, i want it paid back, not passed on. no one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
hey, why are you laughing... wait, did you write it? it's quite poetic.
i know you've always perceived there was something special about the sacred sakura. but to me, it has always been there.
the desserts are great, but i'm still looking forward to the story more than anything.
yeah right... anyway, since when did investigators shy away from delicate situations?
haha... hahahaha! so you've been watching me all this time, have you? i didn't think you were that type!
ugh, can you and the fern get a room already? how can anyone establish a bond with a houseplant? ...although i guess you could say the same about me and my teddy bears...
okay, why don't we go there and take a look?
...you really have a knack for asking the most uncomfortable questions, don't you...
we've already come this far together. i'd like to join you for the rest of your journey on penacony. i'm pleased that we can finally fight shoulder-to-shoulder -- i couldn't ask for a better ending.
the only reason i ever chose to study astrology is because of how beautiful the stars are at night, that's all.
oh, i see. the adventurers' guild is open to everyone's commissions, so she might have some ideas.
what's wrong with that? we've got ten fingers, may as well use them!
then, i'll head back for now. i think i need some time to fully digest everything that just happened.
pom-pom can't just leave the express whenever they feel like it. you didn't know?
hah, did you think i would agree just like that? after our performance of "the little oceanid", i've begun to make a name for myself again, you know.
glowswather... you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
*sigh* ...i can understand your thinking. it's just that the underground is in difficult straits...
silence on the set! lights, kamera, action!
here's hoping the matrix is accurate, and that diviner fu won't decline our request...
why not think about it this way. our trailblazing expeditions are turning into "blast expeditions," where we eat, drink, and play wherever we go.
anyway, i'm layla, a rtawahist student at the akademiya... for now, at least. i was just looking up some information at the house of daena...
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. you're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
*sigh* you say that every time, and then...
but be that as it may, i believe that a lot of them genuinely do expect great things from me.
in fact, i've already had several troupes approach me for the fontinalia film festival. unfortunately, the scripts were all pretty boring, and didn't pique my interest.
he'll do! he's the one we've been looking for!
hahaha... uh, -- it's mainly just that i, uh... can't always comprehend the... lofty ideals and, uh... principles you discuss...
um... maybe we should just grab some takeout.
i'm not trying to talk our way out of this, but... we're not friends with that scoundrel. did you see how fast he ditched us?
can i trouble you to access the records?
(well, i've got nothing better to do anyway. i'll do as she says and see what happens.)
what's her deal...? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
hm, just as i thought, the ritual went very smoothly. thank you both.
we're here to help sort out miss tingyun's things. madam yukong wants to use some of them for her soul-soothing ceremony.
i don't see the shopkeeper. let's look for her in the area.
change will come to inazuma, and with it, new possibilities. this will take time, but eventually, the future will bring healing to the scars of the past.
haha, i just assumed you must've gotten yourself a pet puppy.
he looks beyond saving.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but...
but reminiscing about the carefree life of being a kid sure works wonders for the mind...
give up, furina. there's no point in holding out...
there's a rich scent of curiosity here... such memories can be irresistibly captivating.
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
if there were scales, with all the people of fontaine on one side, and my pain on the other... is it not obvious where the scales should tilt?
let's keep moving. it might be hard to believe, but being out and about is making me feel a lot better than usual.
she's also in the running for the legacy... how is she going to sneak into the dreamscape unnoticed?
with me here it was a walk in the park!
do you have to make it sound all scary...?
i... i can't believe... you...
although i've built up a certain following within fontaine, it is no reflection of strength or wisdom.
even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
seele and i actually aren't from here. we both come from an industrial town to the north. a few years ago, the fragmentum began to seep into the town center.
he ran away! ah... w--what should i do now...
hehe, very good. you've learned a lot since we last met.
uh, hello, i'm a rtawahist student and would like to see the checkout logs for "theoretical astrology" and "a quick reference guide to astrology cases."
i'm sorry, everyone. i was unable to protect the people of poisson... it is my duty to stand trial for my crimes.
i am gradually getting used to this... who knows, i might even be able to perform some high-level moves with hanu.
it is about time that i learned to trust them.
besides, this has only come about because i failed to make a timely decision. this issue started with me, and i shall be the one to finish it.
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
what's that? you want to open it now?
i heard mister yang was once the leader of a secret organization and saved a whole planet! not to mention he's been a teacher, and even a storyboard artist! *sigh* he must be an alien or something...
beelzebul is ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. baal's name was "makoto."
ah, i see. well, that can be fixed. i'll just have the yashiro commission order a few hundred cups and go door-to-door delivering them.
come on, asta has been worried about all of you.
(his villain friends must have been waiting on the other side to buy the stellaron. he went to meet them.)
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
i appear to have frightened the people.
so... is this a dead end?
if i'm not wrong, the knights of beauty also received an invitation from the watchmaker, right?
hmm... i give it a nine point five!
we cannot make an enemy of the divine. no matter what we do, the will of the heavenly principles will have its way, and the prophecy shall be fulfilled...
yeah, who's that? are they some sort of gaming prodigy?
(hundreds of years must have passed by now. perhaps this show must go on for hundreds more...)
i can't be certain. it may be a masked fool's trap. from the execution itself, the riddlers or inquisition spirits could have done this themselves.
seems like you've given her a boost of confidence with your encouragement.
the eternal land, amphoreus.
nothing looks out of place, and everything's spaced out just right.
i could tell you're a very kind person, but i never expected that you'd go this far to help me...
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
i suppose what it comes down to is the definition of "eternity" she set out with.
i have a responsibility to protect the well-being of my patients... or to put it another way: i must eradicate any and all threats to them.
fersman will be very happy with his gift.
i suppose i should get some sleep. hmm, i must say, i do find it hard to doze off peacefully without the soothing sound of thunder booming in the background.
w--withdraw? can you even do that?
did kafka escape? argh, how are we gonna explain this to the master diviner!?
what is it? is there something on my face...?
the look on your face is practically screaming "i'm the one behind all this..."
since it's a classic puzzle, the answer is... "people," right?
the less fragmentum corrosion there is, the safer it gets!
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
well, they weren't in a hurry to make it known. most of the mines have been contaminated by the fragmentum -- many people are out of work. they were afraid of being overwhelmed if they let the word out.
my body... i can't move it.
strange, there appears to be someone else's presence here...
are you... a knight of beauty?
...i hope so. the day i learned the truth was the day i no longer recognized my brother.
*sigh* as long as it's there, we can't get any closer.
i'll stay outside and provide what stability i can. i'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
hey seele, and... sampo's guests. so, it looks like you've already met.
happy birthday! let's celebrate together and make it a moment to remember for the whole year until your next birthday celebration, and so on and so forth. then, you shall have an eternity of happiness.
i'm not surprised to hear that from a nameless. if you ask me, i'd say it was the unity of the family that brought this dream into existence -- and the dream has become just as loving and forgiving as the family.
this is wonderful. my troubles are at an end! i can't even begin to express how grateful i am.
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
since we've embarked on two very different paths to eternity, i can either continue to maintain the status quo or do whatever it takes to bring her back on track, regardless of the cost...
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
please never do that again...
oh please, spare me that look. i didn't sign up for any of this. i'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me...
well, here we go again... ready?
the planet of festivities itself... is a stellaron disaster?
but then, when they opened the door to check, the room was completely dark and there was nobody inside.
your first priority is to prove yourself innocent, after all. i'm sure there is little that needs to be kept secret now... unless your "script" already has holes in it.
that guy can't have gotten too far! let's search nearby.
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze...
well... how else was i supposed to save your skin from the balladeer, exactly?
so why were you hiding from the silvermane guards?
but... general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
thank you so much, mister wilder! we'll cherish every moment.
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
the book contains many ancient "kaidan" -- or tales of the supernatural -- and is written in a very engaging way. that is why the book has become so popular.
hey, why do we have to fight while enjoying the show?
and that photo wall filled with the express crew's happy memories -- it's obvious that miss march loves keeping records of her life.
for the truth and to prevent more unnecessary sacrifices... it is the right choice.
living in the underworld has taught me that this phrase is true. i'd rather trek through the frigid snow plains than live in a beautiful cage.
it's really easy -- see this chandelier? next... we want to create some reasonably *small movements*.
who i am, where i'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
monsters! a lot of them, too... why didn't we see them coming?
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
really? are you doing this on purpose?
the law only judges criminal behavior, and does not weigh human emotion. the court's verdict can settle the question of criminal liability, but...
i've got a lot going on right now, but i'll try to make it next time.
or perhaps the ley lines did not have the power to sustain him for very long. as was the case with the memory we saw earlier.
well, uh i...
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns...?
sorry, i can't answer that question. that ranger is shrouded in mystery. i'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
we can get to the rooftop of the opposite building from here, but it requires a device. i remember it's hidden here...
i know you've many questions, so please compose yourself. before that, you should let your friends know you're safe.
...but after seeing it for myself, i can totally see why people are so taken in by it.
but it is in this miniscule distance that paths cross, and countless worlds connect. the universe may not remember every person who leaves a tie along the silver rail, but we will.
...i hope you're joking, hehe... that's either an interesting metaphor, or you hit your head.
don't you have something cool to say, like "appearances can be deceiving"?
i would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
that's enough! you've screamed and shouted at each other for long enough. now pipe down, both of you!
oh? well if you're quite sure, then of course. now, i shall send you on your way.
but the fact is that both the food and the stories have changed with time...
why do we have to lie? ...i'm abstaining -- i like telling the truth. but... i get what you're trying to do.
i wasn't expecting to receive vip shrine visitors during down time. hehe, so i suppose you're here just to visit me?
(looks like this isn't gonna work...)
i took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
that's it? not even a picture or any other marking to go off of... this is pretty abstract.
but i have experienced it all. that is why i have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
so that's how it is... i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
i suppose it's fair to say, then, that this final show, besides being your farewell to the stage, is also your final gift for her?
you know, it's common courtesy to make sure the homeowner isn't in earshot when you're denigrating their abode.
we are lucky... the damage is not too serious. the yashiro commission will be able to nurse the root system back to health.
oh! and i'm sure neuvillette and those people from the marechaussee phantom are freaking out right next to them, too. hehehe...
look, it's antonia! the miners and vagrants are all in the same spot.
*sigh* looks like i'll have to do it by myself this time.
how are you feeling? any aches or pains?
still... there is one other thing on this topic that i suspect you may be curious to know.
this is so her style, isn't it?
why did she go to khaenri'ah first, and not i? why did she keep me in the dark about it? was it to shield me?
...why do you look so unimpressed?
people in the underworld have gotten used to making the best of a bad situation. that's why i have to keep reminding myself that we're nowhere near where we need to be.
what's happening? the ground's shaking... is it an earthquake?
(i've spent a lot of time out of the spotlight, and they didn't use my name during the curtain call either. hopefully, not too many people recognized me...)
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
all my martial might was in vain... though i could conquer tatarigami and vanquish monsters, i was helpless against the ravages of time, powerless to keep the ones i cherished alive.
suspects!? that's not good...
oh, you're another contestant... hat guy, was it?
...and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
this is the talisman that i lost, the one that my mother made for me...
*sigh* alright... well, keeping you around under duress would only take all the fun out of it.
ahem! yae miko said nothing of the sort, and the traveler has some nerve making up spurious claims about her while she is still present.
great. well, i appreciate your company, so please don't disappear just yet.
huh? i... isn't this a scene from the angler mystery?
is this... fowl? wait, no, the texture is more like shroomboar...
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
let's see... this should be the place. nothing seems out of the ordinary...
although, calling herself the "protector of order" was a bit much, especially when she deliberately operated outside the law...
the stellaron hunters have interacted with the ipc, but not the ten stonehearts... our paths have never crossed. as for your offer, i can pass it along to my partners, but i have a question...
huh? even you're saying that, mister yang? how powerful is that dreammaster?
...right after we finished chatting with topaz in the museum.
don't you think a tournament like this makes a perfect candidate for light novel treatment?
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
hey, wakey-wakey! you'll get mushrooms growing on your head~
it was there that we bid each other a final farewell. i cried bitterly. even in those final moments, i couldn't understand her actions.
y'know, the underground has been cut off from the surface for years. for you outsiders to descend on us out of nowhere is pretty incredible.
*gasp* did you see that? i think something's moving...
you're too modest. to that memokeeper girl... salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall was worth much more than that.
*shivering* gosh... the temperature keeps getting lower... but we can't give up halfway.
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers... i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
it feels like this echo is different from the others before.
this ring is a piece of evidence, right?
well, we're back... just being here again is enough to make me feel dizzy...
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all... that's really weird.
this is a memory fortune pouch i prepared for the express crew. my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
haha. i like that answer.
i hope the ipc made an effort to create some easy-to-follow routes for the players this time...
my existence, hmm...
now, we also know that every aspect of the vision hunt decree's promulgation and execution has been enthusiastically spearheaded by the tenryou commission from the outset.
she's the big shot! definitely got that "queen of the castle" vibe going on. aww, so cool.
i've been familiarizing myself with the angler mystery lately. -- i think it's safe to say i have the best investigative mind on the express at this point...
it's more or less the same as i remember before.
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality... all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
you're quite right, miss hu tao!
sounds good to me, too. everyone makes mistakes. what matters is what you do to make up for them.
could she be tired out from her cosmic concert tour? insisting on performing under such circumstances, miss robin is a superstar among celebrities!
this qian ketong person should be sparkle's targeted victim this time around.
whatever the case, the only way we'll know is if we go there.
uh, w--well...
at this time, cowell arrived in the tunnel, having heard that strange noise, and caught lyney red-handed.
so, who exactly is this elite player?
sounds like the association really cares about their players.
by "salvage," i mean to slowly get close to those memories, and then exert my memokeeper power to retrieve them.
(it's too bad that i had to break the one clear rule i'd managed to make for myself... even if i had no choice...)
a--ahh... don't say that... that sounds horrible.
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
w--wait, hold on a second -- are you really saying that miss tingyun was a member of the antimatter legion all along?
qlipoth the preservation is known for their... indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
come on, how could i possibly lose?
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again... and such a tragedy must never recur.
thank you for your words of comfort. you make a very good point.
there's no point questioning or suspecting me. you're the iudex, but you're still my subordinate -- you should be following my lead.
why isn't svarog helping you?
and the will they demanded, sufficient to penetrate minds and crush dreams.
it wasn't my idea! it was all that pink-haired fox acting on his own! all i did was... well... kind of... engage in free-form sword fighting?
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return...
i'm sorry, you probably just wanted a relaxing stroll, and here i am dumping all this heavy stuff on you.
sounds like you two help out miss yae quite often, huh?
hehehe... "those with keen eyes see the dust between the stars!" i came up with that, by the way.
what!? this fella's already broken... what should we do, take it with us?
during the irodori festival, the area around the outlander affairs agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
if we manage to convince her, i'm quite sure we'll be able to get you another audience with the raiden shogun.
please have some tea, masters!
whoa... the express is going to be much livelier now. but miss black swan, you'd better not use your memokeeper abilities to pull any pranks!
...at least he won't be getting in our way again. let's go find that gallagher and ask him the intricacies of the case.
gallagher... does have a troubled past, it seems.
if i can narrow the search, it'll make my life a whole lot easier. i won't have to buy hundreds of different things and get twirly-whirly to try them all...
i'm the complete march seventh... with all of your forgotten memories.
many people dread the sound of thunder... to me, it sounds fondly familiar.
guess what! something weird just happened when i was on my way over here. someone gave me a strange gift.
ugh, there's no way through here, we need to think of a way to cut her off!
little layla here breezed through her first battle, souka won hers by a hair's breadth... but mine was rather disappointing. my opponent was a frightful bore.
seems the devs forgot to include a surrender option...
ah... well, that's, uh... all in the past now...
that wubbaboo looked so upset. what happened to it...
don't worry, this is my treat.
everything is turbulent and disordered... if you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
*panting* as expected, i lost... how would i be able to beat an adventurer at something like this...?
me? no, i'm not one of them -- not yet. i merely work for them...
eh, i was kidding, and get your own opinion!
but if you mean what i want to do most, right here and now, then... i guess it'd be to simply do nothing.
if it were me... i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
...i take back what i said. we have to hurry to that memory zone where miss firefly's presence was imprinted. considering what this person can do...
it must have been kafka! she's got a scary sword.
c--completely relax? but we're at a cafe, is this not relaxing enough...?
i see. it's as i thought, then. as your god, i did already expect this, but i wanted to see how far your human wisdom would allow you to analyse it.
during our pursuit of a certain person, we crossed paths and just so happened to uncover a shocking plot being concocted by mister sunday...
what...? hey, you can't just make up "titles" like that!
hehehe... you are the same as ever, kujou sara. no one can match you when it comes to loyalty to the shogun.
awesome! i knew you wouldn't abandon such a cute and defenseless creature!
what the heck is she talking about? master diviner, did you actually say that at the time? i can't remember.
hehe. oh, we have reason to put you on trial. it's obvious, isn't it?
but enough of that, i need to pull myself together. the memories i've been reminded of are all really taxing.
erosion is a terrible thing. this body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve eternity.
thoughts from the experts? are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
perhaps you thought i'd planned an intensive training session for you? heh, that won't be necessary. on the contrary, when you're constantly on edge, you miss quite a lot of important things.
they're all just *burning* remembrances... a stark contrast to this deep sea.
are we... in a lot of trouble?
vache... if you had the chance to stand here and watch jarilo-vi from afar...
alright, kameras will start rolling as soon as the set is ready! let's make a film that'll make some serious waves in fontaine!
how about we check out spina di rosula's ship? we should have a view of the whole of poisson from there.
...but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
my right hand? here you go. why is this part of the-- hey, hey! ow, ow, ow!
i'm fine, i...
if i'm not mistaken... we've already met him somewhere, haven't we?
ahhhh, goethe hotel~ home sweet home!
it seems the gods have really smiled upon you, xavier... and that certainly doesn't include me, mind you.
...half an amber era ago?
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward... he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
got it. but... it sounds like mister assistant detective has his own misgivings... would you like to go over it again?
this game is truly unpredictable...
ah, such an intense emotion... heh, makes you break out in a sweat, but you just can't get enough.
...i think i offended someone again.
(hey! that's not the right thing to say...)
obviously! wait! why does that seem so ominous...
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
with your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
oh? well, if that's the case, then... fine, i'll spare you the lecture about your attitude just now.
you can still run, jump, and talk as usual. everything seems normal, but then you'll start doing everything slightly slower than others...
i shall not go back on my word. i have committed to giving it to you, what you choose to do with it is your business. you are quite free to give it to somebody else, if you wish.
oh, and i have to ask a favor. when you give the notes to her later, please don't tell her about my existence.
i followed kitsune saiguu around the mikawa flower festival one year and saw her play akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura.
have you... made up your mind, firefly?
we can and we will! i think it's great!
for the sake of the vision hunt decree, of course. don't you think the shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
good work, everyone! we're looking to wrap with our two main ladies today. i can already smell our success, hehe!
but the people of poisson... they've already...
are you sure? okay then. oh, traveler, do you still have the omamori i gave you?
okay, that's weird...
seriously? and what about you? she just intentionally ignored you!? hmph!
hehe, i suppose i should start by telling you the origins of the irodori festival.
huh? so you could see through my guise? oh. i thought my impression was accurate enough.
th--they are? hah, they're just some rabid fans who want to cut the line because they haven't been able to meet me in person, aren't they?
holding a cultural convention featuring light novels!
so it can only mean... that you are happy to see me again. you have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. they cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
mmm... it's really good.
but since the three commissions work together to serve the shogun, they have a close relationship. someone from one of the other commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to...
i've seen the caliber of the other akademiya students, they're all geniuses and fast learners. i'm nowhere near as gifted as they are...
there i was getting excited to tell everyone the good news...
navia can also use firearms, but unfortunately, her style is quite different from that of the characters in the story.
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
anyway, that's besides the point! the point is, what are the ipc doing here on jarilo-vi?
it's not like i have a very eventful life these days. actually, i barely leave the house. so i don't see how it's unusual that my meals are a little simpler now too.
i know. march, get out of there right now.
for a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the tenryou commission is nigh on impossible.
oh, what's the difference between the two?
let's have a look over there. my gut tells me we should find something connected to vache...
anyway uh... when did i come here last? i don't seem to remember.
wonder if i'll find one here.
that's why the shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. it's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
though she is a puppet, the shogun has her own consciousness, too. when necessary, she appears here to confront me.
indeed. no longer will i ignore their passions and dreams.
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
huh, this little guy looks familiar... ah! are you arlan's peppy? awwww i'm sowwie, your master isn't here. he's gone off to investigate~
guess we won't be able to leave until this act is complete.
what happened to the grand theater stage?
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
anyway, i actually came over to let everyone know that we're all done for today. you can go home and get some rest!
by the way, she left me a message to pass on to you. "always make sure you can distinguish reality from imagination."
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
i don't fully understand yet. but my intuition tells me that the reason for everything... it's that seed.
wow... this place is really lively...
um, did i say something wrong just now?
three times!? this can't be serious, right...?
...before i left, destiny's slave told me that this journey would bring unforgettable rewards. even though the script he gave me only had a few lines, i couldn't ignore them.
huh? where'd the sound go!?
yes. she went to khaenri'ah alone, without telling me.
phew... finally. there won't be too many hindrances after this.
even though she will one day... seize your vision, too?
"stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation"... what a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it...
again... i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
mister giovanni is right, we got all the victory zone mastery marks... all we need to do now is wait for the final showdown!
this happiness was so common as a child, but before i knew it... this feeling was buried in the bottom of my heart.
thanks for standing up for me.
the variable is... our arrival! no outsider's set foot in the underground for over a decade...
hmm? what are you talking about? what do you mean the "other" layla...? i am layla.
oh, but it's alright if you don't want to listen to that kind of stuff. we can also tell jokes about life... or talk about anything you're interested in.
finally, he used the vase to knock her out, before making her change clothes to prevent others from recognizing her.
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
i don't. i've never seen such slates.
you agree, right? i mean, who wouldn't want to be a swordmaster?
that's the most important outcome of this trip. to be honest, i wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when i lent you the pass permit.
i was actually hoping you'd give yanqing some praise!
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
soooo what made you suddenly decide to come down from the express?
clara, you're observant, right? take a look at us. do we look like underworlders?
of course, if there is a day when the underworld doesn't need a doctor like me anymore and everyone lives happily ever after...
huh? it's you... you were there at the fort...
you want a photo with him? sure! please give me your phone. i'll take it for you!
hehe, this is something that will become very important to us further down the line. alright, it's time to move on to the next phase of the plan.
well, since you know about my secret investigations, then you should know i'm actually working to take care of it.
fine, well if you're dead-set on doing something for me, you can treat me to a meal.
ah, he used that "tuning" on us, too! does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?
how do i completely relax?
my adoptive mother always saw me as her own flesh and blood, and vache loved me like a sister... that is, while we were still young.
three!? isn't that when most kids are still struggling to hold a fork?
seeing as you're right here in front of me like this, then i guess... the answer is "a trashcan," right?
i think we should look around where the avidya leopards attacked me.
hmm... would someone really go to all this trouble just to pull off some prank? i can't make heads or tails of it.
okay, i'm ready to head back now.
this shrine looks somewhat familiar.
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
this kind of event doesn't come around every day -- why shouldn't i dress for the occasion? ...you're not really gonna wear that same old outfit... are you?
this isn't going as planned... what should we do?
...slow down -- you haven't completely recovered. seele, don't pressure him... let him rest.
aunt gertie, isn't that you in the photo? and old goethe, too! you look so young!
this place is full of fancy little gadgets -- herta's collection. i really don't get why she'd go out of her way to collect them and then leave them here to gather dust...
it really is nothing major, i stand by that. oh, but since you're so curious, let's have him relate the story one more time, just for you.
because this is the raiden shogun's eternity.
the diviner said i need to provide something from my past experiences...
i just looked up some tips on the interastral network -- these victory zones are leased by the ipc and the gaming association from various planets. the ipc's reach is impressive...
hey, look at that! looks like i guessed right.
my help, hmm? well, maybe you're forgetting that i'm no longer the mighty hydro archon. i don't even have a vision, you know.
alright. well, i'll leave the decision to you.
if you know about corrosion and the fragmentum, then you must have heard of stellarons, right?
hahahaha! ...very good, my people. only ones such as you are deserving of my rule.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance...
it's difficult. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
the call is yours. we still have time to re-shoot an ending if that's what you'd like.
whoa! was that a lucky guess? *gasp* did you go to a music festival without us?
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound...
i'm sorry. i had no other choice...
she actually discovered the key data she needs for her thesis a long time ago. she just didn't organize it well enough. i'll complete her thesis for her, just as i have in the past.
as you've all seen, the situation down here is... strained. if you can, we really would appreciate you helping the people.
isn't a robot shoulder cold to begin with?
he entered through the door from the lobby, and went farther into the hotel. if that's the case... he should have seen everything that happened here...
it's tidy and peaceful here. practically an oasis for insomniacs like me!
even if life is short, memories can be eternal. as long as black swan still remembers me, the mark i leave on this world will not disappear.
and it looks like they went that way.
precisely. but, do you know the deeper meaning behind it?
besides, everyone knows that the main difference between a human and a god is the possession of "authority." gods can do what humans cannot -- that's why they're worshipped as gods.
we made it! from here, we can head to the space station's victory zone. hmm... the atmosphere doesn't seem to have changed much -- doesn't have that tournament vibe.
(oh, almost forgot about that title page... he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
yeah, while i'm smart, learning swordplay sounds like a whole lot of work.
it's alright, monsieur neuvillette. given their confidence, i expect they've found the crucial evidence.
just tell him the palais mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. he shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
uhh, you wait here. i'm gonna get your comrades to help you.
they've jacked up security alright... how the heck are we gonna sneak in? serval, we need one of those brainwaves.
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
all the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that i added to our novel?
shh, be quiet... don't wake her up, just let her sleep peacefully. ...who's "her"? ah, well, a very weary layla who's constantly stressed about her schoolwork, of course. ...and me? hehe, i'm layla too.
but if you still have doubts about ei, i would say they are misplaced.
trust me, you don't want to know the cost of betraying me. just think of the things i said to you as our little secret. understood?
twirly, quick! do the thing... the wind vortex!
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
hey, don't take everything so seriously.
if that's the case... how about we go to edo star first? if that planet really is in danger, then we should go help them out.
and obviously i played my part, too.
hurry, chapter two, let's go. can't you see that satomi is waiting?
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left...
you keep saying that you want to use this final performance to pay tribute to your director and celebrate her life. how can you do that if you're just using it as an excuse to vent your own emotions?
huh? you have a gift for me too, master yanqing?
really? great! phew, it's less scary if someone you know is leading the way!
i was wondering about that too... what happened back there, exactly?
come onnnn, you were the most excited last time we got off the train!
but if you do the math... doesn't that mean the watchmaker was around for several centuries?
before ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet...
and yet five whole days pass before it occurs to you to come and seek help from me. you really expect me not to notice the gaping holes in your story?
hmm? i'm great.
they've got loads of it down there. i just chipped off a tiny piece.
this dream... is becoming more and more separated from reality.
you look much maturer now, yanqing.
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
a little goes a long way.
see, skott? looks like your bros have different ideas of what "family" means.
awesome! i've heard that stellaron hunter girl uses this kind of tech -- maybe we can see it in action.
that will do. i will have the okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
questionable motives? ...me? w--wait, huh?
hey, no need to mention the official name!
how could a person ever be transformed into water? this is reality we're talking about here, not some magic trick!
well, what are you waiting for, little one?
but i worry about the worst outcome: if the dreamscape's anomaly really exists, and it isn't a natural occurrence, but instigated by someone behind the scenes...
ah, so this is what it is. yes... you deserve praise for the effort you took to raise the dramatic stakes.
i never knew there was such a fuss over these tiny figurines... i'm surprised miko never mentioned it to me.
thank goodness the general didn't make us go with the knights... fighting is totally different from adventuring. all these people... i--it's tough to bear.
besides, i'm sure i could master dishes like "la lettre a focalors" or "blubber profiteroles" in no time. if i felt so inclined.
if only there was a way for me to preserve this moment and show it to the kids back home.
instead of resorting to such despicable methods!
but this is just our first meeting. it's a little too early to announce it to the general public.
seriously... i just spent so much time thinking about my dream, but he didn't even ask me!
...what's going on!? the lights have all turned on. so creepy...
how could something so beautiful be unsafe?
all letters tend to follow the same few formats anyway, right? as long as the contents are accurate, it doesn't matter so much how it's written, or how it's worded...
i never knew you could do this.
it's all done... victory is in sight. let's head to the final stage.
of course. i've heard that most humans like desserts, so it's not unusual that i should enjoy them too. miko agrees with me on this.
we'll see who wins next time. what do you say, miss "sole of the deep"? how about a rematch?
ugh... mmm...
alright then. your turn now, my little friend. toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
grr, that sampo cheated us all. wait till i get my hands on him...
by making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
yes, i know the rule, but... but... ugh, it should still be applied on a case-by-case basis! i wasn't ready for this yet!
congratulations, little ones. you've passed the third round of the test of courage.
water as a conscious entity... there's actually quite a few stories that explore this theme.
i just got lucky, i think...
the vision hunt decree is a trap. part of a fatui plot to bring inazuma to its knees.
no saving allowed! let's keep it relevant: this time's for now, next time's for later. no ious on praise!
not so. only everything that pertains to eternity.
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
hehe, it sounds like you'd be more persuaded if you saw me in my fox form?
alright, let's go! time to interview the witness!
what are they feeding you kids down here...
here, keep it... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
...thanks. without your kind help, i wouldn't know what to do.
(*sigh* true... he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
navia, the president of the spina di rosula...
now then, i always have my ways. it's just a question of how crafty i need to be...
that crook wanted to cheat us out of five hundred strales.
but, i think we can't just ignore the safety of penacony.
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
is that... mister giovanni?
*sigh* sorry for causing you so much trouble...
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
i apologize. i wish this were a happier reunion... but there are too many suffering with sickness in the underworld. you're the only person i can go to for help.
what!? argenti wants to leave the express and fight the giant sting alone!?
...yeah. you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
come with me. let's find a quiet place. there's something i want to talk about with you.
oh, is that so? and if i may ask, what did you hear while you were inside your box?
i grew up in a place like this. looking into the distance now with the breeze in my face makes me feel like a kid again.
ultimately, he knocked cowell out, and the tool meant to cover the crime up also became a murder weapon.
*sigh* alright, no more buts... my life is a mess because of the decisions i've made for myself. i should listen to your advice this time.
now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. it does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
heh... hehe... miko, i never thought i would have the chance to meet with you like this again.
and, you probably noticed it when you woke up as well -- the ticking of clocks all around us... my gut tells me that the secret hidden here is also linked to that mysterious watchmaker.
we have to choose where we want to rest forever.
it will bear the name "firefly" and the brilliance she showed at the end of her life.
hmm? what's stopping you? not still traumatized from your last encounter, are you?
i'll do what i can. thank you.
as she indicates, once i started entertaining the idea of change, i became hostile in her eyes.
mm-hmm! oh, we brought you a message from bronya! ahem, "the blockade will soon be lifted. the people of the underworld will breathe freely."
that being said, opening a bar in this place... filled with monsters... is quite a feat. siobhan must have a lot of tricks up her sleeve, right?
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," urakusai.
as an observer, i get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
clear skies can do nothing to hide the brilliance of lightning. divine bolts can strike even in the absence of rain. do you see that tree? wait... you understand? so... demonstration is not required? good.
no, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. in the meantime, i'm sending someone i trust to go with you.
well, can we go now? or is there something else you want to talk about?
so, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? clearly, the musou no hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
heheh, you're quite concerned about that young lady. that's fair -- she was hell-bent on assuring your safety even at the brink of death... started to tug a little at my heartstrings, even.
well, if you insist... alright, i understand.
...mister yang put it nicely, but the reality is this: we sealed the stellaron, but that's not gonna solve the problems on this planet...
it's embarrassing to be out of breath so quickly like this...
it was a close call, i only won by a hair... i'm so glad i trained with miss yae beforehand.
allow me to introduce him to you: this is boothill, a galaxy ranger.
i really don't know what's going on, but for now, i'm calling the phenomenon a "blessing from the stars."
thanks for the information. we're planning to head deeper into the snow plains to find my brother.
not good. try to remember. your name is...
the address that the mask gave you is right here. but you never would have thought... that when miss sparkle mentioned a game, she was talking about wanton slaughter on the streets of penacony.
hmm? what's wrong? just adjust the focal length a bit.
after we fled to boulder town, i made up my mind: a tragedy like that could never be allowed to happen again. that's why i gathered oleg and the others together, and created the first sparks of wildfire.
i have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant makoto was. she predicted all the ways in which inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
yeah... that's the only way we'll know for sure...
i only lost because i was duped by her little tricks.
so, this must be an adepti abode... hmm, though it's a bit different from what i imagined, it's still most fascinating.
quickly, come help! i bumped into a member of the family on the way here. he was so scared and i just wanted to calm him down. but...
as an orphan, i never knew my birthday. my adoptive parents took me to the overworld and made the day i joined the family my birthday.
success! another mechanism shut down.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
...and to realize that i should really take you up on your offer, and make sure i get a good rest for once!
pipe down, everyone. we need to move on to the next scene!
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible... but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
yeah, it's been days since i've had a good night's sleep.
how was it? did you dream of me?
this doesn't feel very "me." is this okay?
(still, i have to admit that, despite everything...)
thanks for the invitation, but right now, i just want to focus on practicing swordplay. masters, let's save the tea for later.
junjun... so she gave her bear a name, huh?
(but i just don't understand. how did she do it? and what does "pawn" really mean? i should go back and ask...)
yanming, what is it that you've prepared?
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something... are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
sailors? can origami birds be sailors...?
but this new master... seems like a bad guy to me, don't you think?
hmm, let me see... which sword is the most powerful? single sword? greatsword? or maybe a flying sword?
still, if that's how i beat him... it'd be a little less... satisfying.
but tell me, why should this concern me? why should i do this for you, when i already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
it requires one to take their sword firmly in both hands and cut down the hopes and dreams of others... even those of one's closest companions.
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
uh... why would he say that?
i don't have any friends that i can be frank and honest with, so maybe she's right. you're the closest thing to friends that i have.
hey, they're finally back!
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
since there is such a great deal of difference between the story and the reality, i don't feel offended at all. on the contrary, i find the author's powers of imagination quite admirable.
okay, take care, and make sure you look after yourself.
no matter what, i hope you can trust aventurine -- or rather -- trust me and see the "truth" with your own eyes. this can lead us deeper into the secrets behind penacony.
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
nope... i'm sorry, i still can't seem to remember, even after everything you've told me. maybe i'm just under too much pressure...
*groan* ...why do i have to write so many papers, whyyy...
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
i figured it out! the day before the resurrection, he appeared near the ambrosial arbor with a stellaron!
hello? can you hear me? this signal is terrible...
but when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
you know, the kind that keep buzzing around the room and distracting you.
tell me, then...! if i'm not the real hydro archon, then who is?
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
can i drink half now and save the other half for later? just in case skott beats me, i can use it to recover...
ask away, but i'm afraid i don't know a lot about him myself.
quick! don't let her escape!
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
the way it looks to me is that shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. would you mind telling me what that's all about?
don't worry. the shogun's not broken, i've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
yeah! can you give us an overview?
let's see what we have this time... whatever it is, i'm ready.
we've met so many people on our journey, there's no way we'll be able to narrow it down...
wait, what? no way -- we're about to leave and i've hardly got any decent photos.
but i digress. if the astral express is in urgent need of a special trailblazing expedition to recharge its engine...
don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the raiden shogun? that's all that light novels are supposed to be -- a bit of fun.
it's rare to hear such comforting words from you. i graciously accept them.
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination...
imagine if all the traveler ever thought about was making you stronger, forcing you to build rock-hard muscles just to watch you send mitachurls flying... would you gladly comply?
...you do have a point. sorry, i tend to panic easily... as you can see.
mm-hmm, you bet! you might not believe this, but we summoned up all our strength, and then...
i, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. so, i will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
hmm... they're actually getting clearer for me. i was sorta expecting this, even before i read the message.
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
look -- down there! it's the ipc!
stop deluding yourself. these new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
at the time i was in such a hurry that i didn't hear the whole mystery. i tentatively speculated that the murderer had killed the victim the night before, but hadn't locked the door from the inside.
after all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. it would be a pleasure to train with you.
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through... not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
only a deep commitment to his ambition to become the best made it possible for him to rise above the pain of these encounters -- to focus on the way ahead.
it's not so bad... at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. in ancient times, poetry was all the rage. but nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
but wouldn't that mean getting rid of them!? ugh...
however, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
i accidentally overheard how the express obtains fuel.
the simple truth of the matter is that i can understand him.
uhh, not the most pleasant memories of that place...
so what are you all doing here? do you need something?
b--but what about my thesis? we still haven't found the seelie's answer yet...
my gift is meager. i hope you don't mind.
not at all. as long as you have different kinds of sauces in, you can have macaroni and tomato sauce one week, macaroni and bolognese the next...
sure, i'll try my best.
*sigh* snow as far as the eye can see. which direction should we take?
if we can get rid of it, your world will be safer too!
...did you travel here alone?
wait a second... did you say "gnosis"?
uh-uh-uh, it seems that you're forgetting, this is the grand narukami shrine...
...naturally, his sister was overjoyed. after all, as far as medicine was concerned, her brother had always been the standard she'd strived to attain.
eh? but... i thought you would be happier to hear the news...?
was this your idea or hers?
let me see... it should be here, i think?
but at least i can say that i no longer desire to play any new roles.
normally you'd want a heater inside a building, right?
oh, that reminds me. if you get the chance, you should try and talk neuvillette into loosening up a bit.
exactly! we're xianzhou experts!
i'm thinking... if i have the chance, i'd love to travel with you and see what lies beyond jarilo-vi.
*sigh* oh, we meet again.
hmm... pretend to be a patient. help me investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
...elio would always say there's only one type of destiny: the inescapable type. he can see the future, and we... likewise are aware of our "predetermined end".
could you... please make an exception? we're not going to cause any trouble.
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
hehe, it was a team effort~
i really want to help the others, but most of the time i'm barely scraping by myself... there's very little i can help with...
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
i--i won't put on any weight since this is all a dream...
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
don't be afraid. to that memokeeper girl... salvaging the memories in the forgotten hall is of great help to the garden.
it would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
huh? you're not coming with us?
wait, wait, wait -- you're not even a little bit surprised by this?
i trusted vache with all my heart. funny, isn't it? and pathetic.
ah! what a two-faced hag!
so, do let me know when you have more stories to share. i'm sure the kids will love them.
what!? topaz!? do you know where they went?
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
my legs are so sore... *sigh* guess i must have been sleepwalking last night... again.
there we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
it'll be quite worth the wait. especially yours, i assure you... hehe...
just as i thought, it's something to do with me again.
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
some things we heard were pretty straightforward, but others were just ridiculous...
*sigh* i'd rather deal with monsters than these big shots...
calm down, firefly... stay calm...
hello everyone, i'm march seventh! i'm an ordinary girl who loves adventures!
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within... the stellaron.
hehe, that's exactly what i thought when i got her letter.
hold on, traveler. there's something else we need to discuss.
the timescale of dreamflux reef differs from reality, so we mustn't lower our guard. you're sensitive to memoria -- a slight misstep, and you could get lost in this memory zone.
(it's becaaaause... because, because, because...)
huh? ah, i don't quite understand what you're trying to say...
but you look like you've got something on your mind... come on, out with it!
ah, uh... it's nothing, really. there are actually some other factors that i've been speculating about...
in the animation, he's hanu's partner and one of the founders of dreamville. does that mean the watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with asdana?
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
so, how'd i do, master?
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
that wubbaboo we just saw... it seemed a little upset. i wonder what madam herta did to the poor thing?
here we are at last... *sigh* it's sad to say goodbye.
no need for fright, and do not take what i said before too seriously. go now, to your duties. the trial i await... it will come one day.
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
it's like i can feel... emotions contained within them. confusion... fear... sadness... and others so faint i can barely feel them...
miss yae lost the match, but why is haniyyah the one who seemed upset...
did you hear that! she just called me "my lovely lady"...!
one of them is yanqing, the boy we've all met before. the other is yunli, the granddaughter of general huaiyan from the xianzhou zhuming.
oh please, it's the result that counts~ gotta take risks sometimes if you wanna succeed~
yeah, i'm counting on you.
also, please allow me to ask, as the final question before the trial begins...
haha, it's possible.
i mean, considering how you helped us out with cocolia, i'm sure bronya would be happy to see you!
she told me her price, but...
but as the victor, i acknowledge your honor
march, march... can you hear me?
yeah, you just need to tell us what the trouble is, hehe~ general jing yuan pulled out all the stops to get us here -- you can trust us.
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
the true "death"... where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
we were just talking about her, as it happens. little layla told me that haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. but after you met layla, she very abruptly left.
you're right! let me see, how does this coin work again...?
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
"the fox you gave me is very beautiful, miss shrine maiden, but i still love my old friend the most."
this upcoming scene is the two musketeers' final confrontation with the baron. there'll be quite a bit of action, but no choreography beyond what we've already rehearsed.
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
yeah... surely we've earned it?
hmm... i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
kujou kamaji... a descendant of the kujou clan, i presume.
wow... i didn't expect to find a place like this in the underworld!
fireflies and butterflies often fly to me, but spiders and cockroaches come too... that's why i prefer cold places. but when the temperature drops, i also don't want to move. what a dilemma...
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
i get your point, but this isn't the time for deflections -- quickly, say something nice about me!
um... this gentleman is?
okay. then... i'll tell you more about me.
yeah, let me think and see what i can make of it.
i'll be at uyuu restaurant -- find me there when you're done. i will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
(this time... i will protect you.)
you're already at this stage... just eat whatever you like.
it must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
huh? really? i just wanted to say something...
diting can convey a lot of information with only a few sounds.
after seeing the city, a thought popped into my head: "am i really worthy of this place?"
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
what! how did you guess that on your first try!?
...do you think the great mine was affected by our fighting on the surface?
...oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
madam faruzan and me were hired to fine-tune the compass and other equipment. we sailed around the sea of clouds all of last night to put the system through some stress testing...
true... and if i don't get an answer, then i'll only have wasted more time.
you know i would never do such a thing...
however, the same applies to the order. their plan didn't materialize overnight, and they have the profound collective consciousness of the planet of festivities behind them...
i'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
and i'm always scared that i'll miss something important... ugh, i'll never be able to forgive myself if that happens!
do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the sacred sakura's roots?
ah, speaking of which... actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for... that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
ugh, come on, stop fooling around.
"believe in the furina you see on stage. she is the one you can trust."
(phew... perfect timing. the situation was really starting to get desperate... and not just because of the prison thing...)
the tombstone that belongs to me once bore the inscription "glamoth's iron cavalry," then it changed to "stellaron hunter," but one day...
now, from the gold, blue, and rainbow decks of cards, please pick the deck that fits you best.
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete... right?
is there any other way to enter a dream besides the hotel room's dreampool?
that's been out of fashion for hundreds of amber eras!
it appears we can't climb the stairs in our current state...
"a nation to last for all eternity" is a dream that she and i both share. but i don't think that's the same thing as complete stasis.
whew, himeko~ what took you so long! that last wave of antimatter legion came at us like a swarm of locusts, have you ever tried shooting locusts with a bow?
i think it's only right to tell you.
it's true. it's ridiculous that a single probe can fetch seven hundred fifty shield.
next up... let's interview those two over there.
the reason being that she lost to me. and when i say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. it was quite a humiliating defeat.
and also... my mind was consumed entirely with the plight of inazuma and the fate of those closest to me.
as you wish. it's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
the door... it won't open...
...we're pretty lucky, huh? without findie, it probably would've taken half the day to find these parts.
let's sit down here and have some coffee and sweets. it'll help me put my thoughts together.
ugh, there'll be no need for that. i've seen them already. there's no need to go back over scenes i've witnessed in person before!
um... i--i'd rather be mentally prepared for what might happen...
now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits"? anyone?
*sigh* i still haven't made much headway on my thesis. at this rate, i'll need the wisdom seelie's help.
the energy they consumed, great enough to vaporize the oceans and turn day into night.
since that's your testimony, i have no more questions. it appears there really are good grounds to reopen this case...
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
*panting* ...i really need to keep up with my training.
ahh, whatever. can you please tell me how to submit a question to the wisdom seelie?
ah, so that's why you're here... tut-tut, yes, that is a tricky situation.
compensation? they hit us!
pretty simple... i just hope these tests don't take too long.
you must have been blaming yourself all this time. you knew kamai and the samurai became friends as a result of akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura, a game connected to your existence.
even when we're not looking up at the stars, they're always there, watching over us.
hmm? what is it, good citizen...
eversummer... was that always the name? seems i was too young to get the irony back then.
...ugh, this is serious, y'know.
the answer is simple: it's because the assistant detective is the murderer.
yeah, i've not only learned swordplay from masters, but i've also met a bunch of people and gained a lot of insights from my experiences.
wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. like i said, you can think of it as the silvermane guards of the underground.
i--it's bigger than i thought... hey you, i was just joking! leave us alone, shoo!
is that so? i'm afraid you're just overthinking things.
huh? what do you mean...
do you say this because you have not yet reconciled yourself with your defeat?
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times... it's making me a little nervous.
that's right. did you hear that? repeat after me: dream-- flux-- reef.
ah, there's a red stamp on it! the seelie responded! fantastic!
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
would you be willing to join me? c'mon, take a break from adventuring to listen to a story.
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
the shrine maiden i tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. you'll know her when you see her.
ahh, juice... if i say the word, i get a craving. if i get a craving, i wanna drink some. and if i drink some... ahh... i can't stop!
we're a little early. i've got an idea...
of course i don't. there is no need for commerce in the plane of euthymia. if i ever need something, i can simply have one of the commissions bring it to me.
the same to you and your friends. you've just arrived and already helped resolve such a sizable conflict. i don't know how to thank you.
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
come on, let's go back to the house of daena to make preparations. you'll have to tell her later when she wakes up.
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying...
how do i put this... you're no match for her at all.
traveling between the stars... even an adult like me can't help but find it captivating, let alone the children.
indeed. in kafka's words... that's also a "missing part" of my life.
all so that as soon as i appeared on the stage, the trial may commence without a hitch. am i right?
during the festival, most of the yae publishing house's editors will be staying near the outlander affairs agency. if you run into any problems, you may find them there.
what the actual -- that thing was flaming hot! you said things that never happened to me in reality couldn't happen here!
alright! here comes, the jarilo-vi trailblaze team!
i can be a little bit camera-shy -- just don't laugh at me. here, you hold the camera.
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
i knew you'd be interested.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express...
then on to the next order of business -- let's discuss your companion, shall we?
hehe. i see how it is! so this was all just a bluff. and here i thought you had something to show for it, but it seems you're still far from the truth.
aha! i've just received a message from serval and pela -- it seems they're ready for us!
fine by me. let's do it!
is everything all right, bronya? i didn't know miss topaz was so... intense. she seemed nice when we met her.
uh... y--you're starting to make me feel nervous...
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
mm... i'm okay. if i were in his shoes, i may well have had the same reaction. now i need to focus on treating the patients, and dispelling their doubts.
i can't let myself see only the things i want to see. how would that make me any different from before?
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
don't worry, we can keep a secret. just make sure it doesn't happen again!
and that's my answer to your question. d--do you have any other questions?
never mind, what's done is done. it's really my own fault for getting in too deep, hehe.
huh? a swim?
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need...
you will miss much by refusing progress... you seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
if you want its help, all you have to do is write down your question, and you'll get a response a short while later.
ah, looks like i'm the one who got distracted.
my dear demoiselles... uh, ladies... no, uh, i mean... friends! please take me with you!
no, i have nothing to say. i am furina, the archon of fontaine! everything will surely get better!
i know what you're thinking, but alas... that girl isn't in there, and neither is this her room.
yes... and now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
uh... kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
huh!? wait, this is it!
a chance combination. hmm, interesting. may i try this drink?
i understand your concerns, but... i'm sorry. i just don't have anything to tell you.
don't look at me like that. i've never had to tinker with the shogun before, and she's very complicated. it's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
i agree with dan heng, we can't just leave her to the bullies.
oh, c'mon layla, what are you doing? everyone's gonna start thinking you're crazy now...
himeko! there's a celebration coming up on jarilo-vi, organized by the supreme guardian, and we're invited to go take in the sights and sounds.
i did say this is what "we're" going to do. i trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
first, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
a meticulously choreographed "chance meeting..." sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
yeah! if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and ei! are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
since the moment it was built, the grand theater has graced the entire dreamscape with its rendition of the odes of harmony.
...what? that's all!? if neuvillette were to hear of this, he could charge you with underpaying your labor!
it looks so... lame.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
what exactly is he... talking about?
miko, come on... no need to put them on the spot like that.
in other words, you believe that he knew nothing of the incident?
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
...there is something else he cares more about and needs -- or should i say, is verifying.
looks like the key to winning lies not in the puzzle itself, but in the motives behind miss sparkle's strange behavior... i'm afraid this chase may just go on forever.
everyone, get ready. this could be a tough battle.
*sigh* huh? what's that huge structure in the distance...
from now on, i'd like to cherish every single day of my life... even when it's not the smoothest of rides.
what about you, mister yang? i heard that even miss robin wasn't spared, and that guy locked you both up...
i'll lend you an extra brain cell.
looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. and he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
so she didn't regret her decision. even as she sat in silence, waiting for death to come.
(i've conducted so many investigations across the centuries, but there's not even a sliver of hope that we might break the prophecy...)
well try this on for size -- nope! i can't stand anymore of this fighting, so there!
hello, sir! is there anything i can do to help you?
cat got your tongue? it's fine, he seems like a good guy. hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
as for the context... we'll need to sort that out a bit. hurry along now. recreating memories on this scale takes quite a toll on me.
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
that's the spirit! strike while the iron is hot!
which means... seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
since you clearly understand, perhaps you could think about making an effort, too.
(so interminable... so lonely... just how much longer...)
...wait, wh--why are you all looking at me? you're not seriously expecting me to fight, are you!?
...that sounds like too cruel of an ending to me. and perhaps a little irresponsible to present to the audience.
aww, poor thing.
they've been up for a while already. the young guy with the dark hair left first -- he went with sampo.
this one is a little bit complicated... i have to put on my thinking cap.
well hang onto it, it's cute.
...did you really have to add that last part!?
i know you have many questions... do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme...
the quicker we handle the ipc, the faster we can get back to enjoying the celebrations. let seele know when you're ready to go.
haha, dan heng's not icy. he's nerdy.
...i raised my hands just now to indicate my acceptance of the trial. no duel shall be necessary.
by the way, in those immersia stories, the swordmasters always hide their true strength before a decisive battle.
then what are we waiting for? let's go grab ourselves the title!
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
is that... hanu?
blonde, tall, good-looking... *sigh* those landau genes sure are something else.
clara? oh, the girl we saw in the great mine?
indulge my curiosity. what is the reason that i find you standing here before me once again?
i understand. let's do this.
i'm so grateful that miss navia was so understanding. to be perfectly honest, i didn't know if i was ready to meet her.
when that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
bah, no way! everything good has come our way due to our hard work. i'm not letting them take any of the credit.
hehehe... i wish you the best of luck. may you soon discover the truth behind it all.
i'll come back tomorrow to check on it. don't worry about me if you have other things to do.
...the fateometer? what's that?
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
well, since you asked so nicely...
hey, miss qingque, care to get involved!?
...what's wrong, mister yang? see anything fishy?
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
for the children in the clinic to truly know the feeling of this view, they'd have to be here to see it themselves.
...wait, what do you mean, "either"?
well, that's that. but it is gonna be hard to let go of this bazooka...
but in any case, it sounds like the issue has already been resolved?
haha, it's no pity at all. it was just a little fun competition.
he was gentle and introverted. but when it came to work he could be absurdly obsessive... like a completely different person.
kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
sure, but don't push yourself. if you start feeling unwell, come straight back and tell me.
i'm surprised an outlander like you is aware that there was once a change of electro archon... few citizens of inazuma are aware of this.
rivals...? why the heck are we rivals now? what are you talking about?
that's right! unparalleled!
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
i know every individual word in these books' titles. so why is it that they make no sense to me in these particular combinations?
as for what has triggered this change, i believe it must be the loss of his vision. for to be stripped of one's vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair...
we're truly sorry for what happened... but this is not the end of the story, right?
...so you promise that if i win hide-and-seek, you'll tell big sister march all the ins and outs.
you made it... i thought you were about to miss out on a moment of history.
heh... much like a certain fatally flawed friend of mine.
what are you talking about? what mirror?
tell me the truth sampo -- what are you gonna do about the overworld girl?
ugh... sorry for crashing your artist party, but we came to talk to you about something else...
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate...
yeah, but when i finally managed to calm myself down, i noticed that the talisman my mother had made for me was missing.
more importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
yeah, i remember hearing this world was invaded by the legion hundreds of years ago.
she seems to be waking up now. well, this is goodbye. if we never meet again, then... i guess i did something right, hehe.
oh? come over here, you little critter you!
let's stop here... i don't think i can walk any further...
and that's not surprising -- you're different from others. you seem to radiate a confidence most people don't have.
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou...
dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? after all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of teyvat.
hmm. so even i, who seeks eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence...
each year on that day, my parents would give me a bouquet of first snow. the number of stems represented how many years had passed since i joined the family.
the first tenryou commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. that is why the title has been passed down within the kujou clan ever since.
she told me that you salvaged the forgotten hall's memories with great skill, that you are a rare talent.
sure, i haven't done that in ages. let's go!
your dad worries about you -- stop giving him reasons to.
now to set the record straight with svarog. let's get in there!
...what am i going to do with that girl.
i cannot reach a conclusion with so few clues.
also, also! if i was really just a human, why would i dare to just put my hand in that kind of water!?
*yawn* ...so tired. i just wanna put my head on a pillow and drift off...
(what does she mean, "onto something"? i certainly don't know any five-year-olds who want to fight a vishap in their spare time!)
i've got a few patients who've started refusing treatment since joining the society... it certainly makes you wonder.
at that time, i could sense ei's whereabouts, but i also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
that's not right... that line doesn't sound very "surprised".
yes, the story is the reason i agreed to join. i can't bear to even imagine what this film would look like without the very best director.
let's just forget about that part. he's already in such a sorry state.
although i don't think anyone will have any objections.
stay? but herta...
not telling yet... we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
don't let your emotions get the better of you. if i were in his shoes, i might well have had the same reaction. now i need to focus on treating the patients, and dispelling their doubts.
ugh, you need to log out once in a while.
whoa, the fort's packed... i've never seen this many people here before.
we shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of penacony or the family.
recently, i have observed a number of changes in the external world from the plane of euthymia. the most serious of these being the attack on the sacred sakura by numerous rifthounds.
why, of course i do. allow me to take the first shot and break this case wide open. mister lyney is clearly lying.
hmm, good point. why else would it use such a roundabout way to tell me its answer?
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
wait. what did she just say? i didn't get dissolved! shouldn't that be enough to prove my innocence?
after all, it'd probably be impossible to find it and ask my question in person...
wow, now that's what i call a pay-off.
...me? have we met?
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
hee-hee, you like it? it's yours. a farewell gift from us.
luocha turns a corner, but the corner leads straight to an inn... then he exits the inn and goes into spare time book shop without buying anything.
this is the largest park in golden hour -- it represents the soda culture of penacony. that gigantic soda bottle houses the headquarters of the soulglad enterprise!
hey, that's actually a compliment i don't want to hear!
yeah. thank goodness you were there to help me out, or i don't know where i would've ended up.
bingo... *sigh* the pressure from my studies and debt was crushing me, and i didn't want to tell my family about any of it.
hah, i doubt it... i mean, unless i somehow came here while i was unconscious, and don't remember it.
...she disappeared.
thank you. choose whoever you like. wildfire will take care of the rest.
but just now... it all became clear to me. i still don't have the right to come to terms with fate on behalf of everyone else...
we talked to people in both the overworld and underworld. the final result was... a tie.
all right. i don't have a problem with that.
i'm so jealous that you got a good night's sleep. i was traumatized and too scared to even close my eyes. i thought if i fell asleep, i'd never wake up again.
perhaps... perhaps i've been holding on to everything too tightly.
and whenever i think of this, i feel something stirring within musou isshin.
i'll bet the audience has never seen such a realistic prop.
come on... stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
still, who knows. he must be more experienced than me -- maybe he's just better at dealing with it all than i am.
his figure gradually disappeared into the snow curtain... i've been telling myself that vache is dead ever since.
later on, she probably got sick of answering those questions and decided to stick to just two -- the "protector of justice" and the "protector of order."
does this not clear all doubt?
i--is he still standing? goodness, he sure has a lot of hp...
aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. but this galaxy ranger... we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
it's a pretty solid story overall. i thought it was just an ordinary adventure at first, but the further we got into it, the more impressed i became with the production and the plot.
oh, nothing. it just seems extraordinarily chaotic, that's all. my suspicions have been confirmed.
i once told myself that i would never speak of these events again. facing the fact that she is gone is unbearably painful.
all the miners here huddled together... anyone else getting deja vu?
witness my magnificence!
i came here to conduct some astrological observation once. everything went smoothly on the way, and i thought i was starting to get used to life at the akademiya.
seems like perkins picked up a stammer?
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
wake up... gotta wake up!
twirly-whirly and the other shroom buddies were way stronger than i thought. before i knew it, they'd knocked the opposition out...
a dream i wished i could have continued after waking up...
no matter how long it takes, i am committed to bringing this to fruition. this is my promise.
one down already! we're on fire!
...who're you calling little miss pink!?
fine. it appears that you were waiting for me to show up. i suppose there's no use in me pretending.
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
oh... there's no need to apologize! you had nothing to do with it. and, anyway, everything she did was for a good cause.
hey, i'm not actually gonna recite a poem! i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived on the xianzhou...
hold on! that's a big guy over there.
what about you, then? is this the moment you finally find the "death" you've been looking for?
but there is no urgency. to reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
penacony's golden hour is pretty amazing, isn't it?
if this theory is correct, little layla's wish may yet come true. once you've gotten to know each other, you'll be able to freely communicate without using the wisdom orb.
the sun feels almost as hot as those studio lights i'm in front of all the time... good thing there can only be one sun.
don't run! i got you, hook!
what are you afraid of? surely you don't think that aurelie's story is unworthy of the grandest stage in fontaine?
...that actually makes sense.
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
*pants* i feel... a little faint...
oh, hehe... thanks for the compliment. i sure don't get to hear that often.
ah, so that means... we're not going to the luofu.
i have no idea what's going on... no wonder this seelie is becoming legendary. let's keep reading the clue.
i'm not so good at analyzing people, but seeing as you asked...
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
that uniform... was it him that texted you?
please! you thought your crude replicas could keep me out? you appear to have woefully underestimated who you're dealing with...
"if you're reading this letter, then you have succeeded in taking the first step."
which is why you've set them loose in the underground?
it's all my fault! i didn't train enough!
excellent, then let's start with the scenery shots. kamera and clapper loader, you're up.
as a guuji, there's one thing i know very well: people believe whatever they want to believe. some things you do not see, simply because you do not wish to look.
thank you for understanding. if i were the one complaining about not being well-rested, it would just sound like an excuse.
so... what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
let me guess -- time, karma... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
makoto's gaze was always fixed on the people of inazuma. i always assumed it was because... that was her duty.
that settles it then. thanks for sticking by me throughout all this...
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
it's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. it was once quite popular during festivals.
i still don't know anything about the blessing from the stars. will it never happen again since i don't need its help anymore?
more fixing? i'm getting good at this!
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
but for the children who were born into this era, who grew up in this isolation... this will be a new life altogether.
let's waste no time and head to the theme park then!
okay... i think i got this...
oh? such elusive emotions... i've never encountered memories quite like this before, it's stirred my curiosity.
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie...
not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command... did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
haha... sometimes you just have to laugh at the absurdity of it all.
(...oh, wait! we're supposed to be roleplaying. i should stay in character.)
pay you? what is this? you want payment for a simple favor?
*sigh* my mind is completely blank... i need to get out and unwind.
it's time to get the next mastery mark!
there's nothing but... a jigsaw puzzle here.
i know it's not her first rodeo, but the thought of her taking on those horrid monsters... i can't help but worry.
since you invited me and all... sure.
falling asleep in a place like this... impressive!
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
if that's the case, i've got a question for you:
ah, good show today, both of you. it was so much fun to watch.
most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines... their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
hey, it wasn't like i wanted to play! the kids forced us to...
i mustn't keep repeating my past regrets. that's the most valuable lesson i've learned today.
the differences are considerable and the astrological effects are entirely different... we need to consider how the effects offset and, um...
i can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.
spread to the four corners of teyvat!
because we need geomarrow. after belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. the eternal freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
i would like to officially announce that our entry to the festival, "the two musketeers," has now concluded filming!
yes, those photos are not just ordinary records of her trips. to miss march, they are dearly precious memories.
hehe, it's funny how he tries to act all mature, but whenever it comes to something he's interested in, you can really see his childish side.
i advanced all the way to the semifinals.
that was a figure of speech, do you understand? nitpicking my turns of phrase, the sheer audacity.
defeating signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
a soldier's perspective is always valuable, dunn.
i also have you to thank. the things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. amazing...
no time for guesses! let's just head to rivet town and find gepard first.
by the way... remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
hehe, i hear that question a lot -- seems like he owes everyone something. that's why he never discloses his whereabouts.
ugh... hm?
has anyone finished this round yet?
pleasure to meet you, miss topaz. i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
since the battle, the shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
w--wait, look at the eyes...
so tell me, how do you plan to respond to the fontainian musician? it sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war...
how does he always hear us!?
kuroda? what are you doing here?
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless...
can't you put a little more enthusiasm into it?
i'll do my best to tell you everything i know when we get there.
ah! what about the girl in red? that robot is gonna take her away!
this is the luxury store i told about you earlier.
no, no, no! oh, this is bad...
hehe, i suppose that is what she's been calling me.
clearly, everyone needs to take a step back for now, and reflect on what really matters. when emotions are running high, things get lost in the fray.
...wonderful, that's such a relief.
sh--share the contents of my research... and answer questions? uh oh...
i bet it's about how to deal with the generals from the yaoqing and the zhuming.
yeah, skott couldn't come up with a comeback.
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
huh? i was just kidding... please don't take me seriously.
he came about as a byproduct of creating the shogun. perhaps it's because i feel like i owe him something, but i do not wish to assert control over him.
what's wrong, bronya? do you feel sick?
it's alright, relax. i'm just here to look around. i'm having a change of pace today.
buuuut it's already getting late... how about we head back to goethe hotel for a bit and then set out on the express tomorrow?
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
no way. master yanqing has been great to me.
i may have misjudged this game's complexity.
svarog? that name sounds familiar...
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise...
why... because you are blessed with a wonderful fluffy tail, that's why. i think it's very cute.
see? it knows everything.
mm... too late, the moment's gone!
the tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
not too long ago, i read a collection of horror stories from liyue. the content was spectacular. in fact, i still feel the need to sleep with the light on even now...
you're not dead yet. how can you give up that easily!?
hmm, well, she's always been in a fragile state. if she knew that there was another "layla" who's always taking care of everything...
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
my dear citizens, my loyal audience, allow me to present my reasoning and bring this performance to a swift close.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
the rules i set for the shogun are... no, the shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. it shall not be easily swayed.
time to look at the letter. please let there be a stamp, please let there be a stamp...
heh, i'm only telling you this so you can properly understand my plan. could you possibly spare the sentimentality for the time being?
people still use mora in commercial transactions, i assume?
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
alright, just kidding. just trying to liven things up around here.
by the way, i've just noticed... you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
mister sunday, even if the members of the oak family can't fully agree on what to do about the stellaron, now's not exactly the time to be holding an extensive discourse about penacony's past and future, is it?
that's why i still haven't performed the necessary observations yet. i don't know what to do.
it's a little bit like... porridge? but the resemblance is only superficial...
so he paid for the book and tore off the title page to protect people from the spoiler...
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
we'll have to cut the banter short... let's first work together and remove these overly friendly children, shall we?
really, paimon. it's not like you don't know me. do i look like i know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment...)
though the strike from the general was timely, its destruction was also immense. when "emanators" collide, ordinary people inevitably suffer.
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal... tends to leave a deep impression.
of course, crew members are always right.
perhaps he plans on doing so, but i won't.
at first, i was worried i wouldn't be able to get to sleep without my normal bed, or that i... well, anyway, turns out i was worrying for nothing.
why would he leave exalting sanctum via a secluded dock? that's so suspicious!
(first, let's try to figure out the seelie's identity based on the clues we currently have.)
*gasp* what a cute doggy! ...oh, you're here too.
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
...i'm about to duel with skott, but i always feel like my fighting skills haven't improved enough! can i really defeat skott? i'm starting to worry!
why? why is every elevator in the underworld busted!?
who knows? i mean, we are the champions!
oh, has night fallen already? then you'd best go have a rest.
are still trapped in the dreamscape at this very moment.
aside from that, i have to say the family has been really accommodating...
he must be a fan of this book too... i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
looks like we've got to help those guys kneeling down over there calm down a bit, right?
that was when i saw you. you didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
so... where are we headed to now, bronya?
umm, this is getting a little complicated... is there a... simpler explanation?
(aw, good thing i made all those preparations. seems the all-nighter i pulled last night is really paying off!)
i can't remember the last time i went swimming. i might not even know how to anymore...
haha, you have a wild imagination.
it's a whole row of those gate robots! we saw one in the divination commission...
ah yes, i'm sure that by this point you must be feeling ever so grateful for my kindness and are looking for a way to repay me, yes? well, here's your chance.
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge...
you've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the sacred sakura and makoto's consciousness. but unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
nothing. i suddenly want some fried tofu.
thank you, destiny, for giving us the chance to meet again.
...before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
this guy is really into these puppets.
wow, this would be the perfect location for shooting a film.
i've seen your face before, stellaron hunter, even if it was only on a corporation wanted poster. they were offering quite the bounty... dead or alive. do you know the figure?
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
so this set... is going to be a part of the script?
that person up ahead... is he asleep?
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
"everwinter hill..." what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat...?
*sigh* seeing you again is a change to eternity... and a very nice surprise.
ready? one, two, three...
could you ask oleg how luka's been recently? i haven't seen much of him lately -- it's hard for me to get the full picture.
...th--the sampo hotel? this is goethe hotel!
that's right. you should have gotten the gist of the content in my thesis when i was explaining it earlier. so, ask away.
we probably still have a while until the stars come out...
uh... can't we get bronya to cover the bill?
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest... yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would...
surely an onion can't be that expensive... right?
my power as an archon? there are many ordinary citizens in the audience. how can i just carelessly demonstrate the formidable power of an archon...
but the shogun is still running based on her old rules. i can't allow her to make any more mistakes while i am working things out.
the murky mirror reflects the view of inazuma in a bygone age. spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
you could go see how madam faruzan's doing. i've heard that she's quite knowledgeable about the desert, so she's probably made some progress by now...
...they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
makoto saw a bigger picture than i did. in her view, a "dream" is more imaginary, more abstract than an "ambition."
but the truth is right here in front of my eyes, and i can't deny it.
foreboding signs can also be superficial. you may have good fortune after riding out the storm.
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
(i--it kinda works, right...?)
let me see... metal plates, gauze bandages, painkillers, rubbing alcohol... perfect, that's everything i needed.
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time... train or no train.
when we gave him the flower, he failed to hide his smile. you can't imagine how hard it was to get him to smile.
over there! clara went down on the elevator.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
mister yang? mister yang's here too? didn't he stay on the express?
h--hello, are you azzam?
though your power was weak, i was still able to find you. you were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
not quite. i only want to ask, how exactly did she become a galaxy ranger?
but from the whispers of the residents, i've heard a familiar name... gallagher.
does it... look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
it'll give you a chance to figure out her moves in advance and come up with a counter strategy. that should be a big help, don't you think?
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
so... the auction didn't go too well, huh?
she seems to be sharing her discovery with someone, and... it's related to the watchmaker.
i know, but the thing that i can't get out of my mind... is the present.
do you think he captured someone and put them in the coffin?
you're talking weird again... but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
are you really from the divination commission?
many challenges still lie ahead for inazuma, but i am prepared for them.
if this rain keeps up, my fur will be dripping wet...
but the wisdom seelie is truly amazing and freely shares its endless knowledge.
but we can't lose our momentum, master yunli!
no need for the melodrama. that was still a magical performance...
uh, yes. that's right...
and yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
with you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
but even then, that doesn't necessarily mean that i'm actually the wisdom seelie. it could have just helped me while i was sleepwalking.
well, in my opinion, sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the order is right.
hehe, that's very kind of you. don't you underestimate the leader of wildfire.
you've been on the express for a while now, but you've never gone on a trip with himeko before, right? well, now's your chance!
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
oh, interesting! i wasn't thinking about it like that. i suppose it's not so different from an acting troupe, everyone has their own role to play.
i know it's tough to believe all this without reservations. i just want to say you're very close to the final answer -- just one more thing needs to be done, and then i can prove it to you...
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
it's best to be skeptical of her. there's a significant amount of intentional misdirection in her words.
a bird with sharp edges and points... umm, i don't think i saw it.
this should fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle.
*gasp* are these echoes too?
but it's fine if you want to give it a shot... i trust your judgment.
ah, the permanence's descendant... what a charming little dragon, especially with those mired memories of yours.
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
...does "miss sparkle's body" even count as a real character?
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
but that miss firefly is truly mysterious. there's no information on her in the hotel system. even if she's a stowaway... she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
i suppose we can slow down for now then...
seems like the smoke is getting thinner...
*sigh* am i to take it that the safety of the people of inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
okay, you won. go on, you can put on that smug face now.
i... don't know, but i hope you do.
you know, i was just thinking... how did the two of you meet?
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
when you arrived at the reverie hotel, you met the {ruby_b#bellboy}doorman{ruby_e#} misha and had a confrontation with aventurine, an ipc representative. thankfully, acheron appeared again and helped you.
is that really a bad thing, though? it can get tough always being the one shouldering everyone's expectations.
...people with big dreams have big determination.
oh no... how did this happen...
in penacony, everyone may be lying, and yes... that includes me. i can't deny this, nor do i seek forgiveness.
is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? how does it taste? and how do you cook it?
hi, we meet again... what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
uhh... we're gonna see her right now? can i at least find a place to freshen up first?
don't be ridiculous, luka. still, whatever your motivation was, i hope you can find a different outlet for it.
that guy's really taking it to a whole new level. does he really think he's a superstar or something?
it turns out that there is still another piece to the story of kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
yeah, yeah. well, pack your souvenirs and stuff. back home we go!
a world hidden away from outside observation, its presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the garden of recollection...
no one knows who or what it actually is... it's just known as the wisdom seelie.
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
what exactly would that look like? i can't wait!
alright, how about this... we'll work with what we have. i'll give you some scenarios, and see if your work is up to my standards.
...now's as good a time as any to tell you vache's whole story.
yup! i always say what i'm thinking.
even with the erebus, you must've put in a lot of effort to get such a good price?
i'm sorry, master yanqing, master yunli... i lost...
when all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved inazuma, forever and ever. isn't that right?
looks like you've remembered everything now.
speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current inazuma?
so the three of them teamed up to kill her?
dim sum... is that some kind of liyue term for snacks or desserts?
yes... i have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.
then the ipc isn't your family! stop lying to yourself.
correct. that medicine is a wolf in sheep's clothing -- wildfire has cut off the supply chain.
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
i don't understand -- did you not show them to my parents?
of course not! we scared him off.
hmm. so you've heard of it, too.
perhaps in your mind, you also view me as "weak"?
oooo! all those benefits that the general promised -- they're finally here! yippee!
nothing's wrong, okay? come on. we're going to war.
not only does she not fit your description, but she voluntarily gave up her gnosis long ago, severing her ties with celestia in the process.
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley...
during my absence, i place everything in miko's hands.
then... what's going to happen to miss robin? she and sunday won't be able to deny their involvement in the charmony festival, they're siblings after all...
good. how about you, little one? i trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
another anomaly in eternity...
no, only a handful. after all, i prefer warm memories baked in sunshine. they're the ones that usually belong to kind people.
hehe... she is a member of the shuumatsuban, a genuine, bona-fide ninja.
i hate to admit it, but i'm even starting to miss sampo... hold up! i must be losing my mind. nope -- i'll take the xianzhou over that blue-haired bore any day...
is the starskiff haven always this crowded? there are so many people here! i can barely hear anything!
hey, don't you understand? you're currently the prime suspect for a major case! this isn't the place for you to be looking for fights.
you're welcome. and thanks to the memokeepers in penacony, too. i believe your partners... have also awakened from their dreams.
i circled the whole area, but i didn't find anything.
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
easier said than done... do you know how?
or... we could go check out some other fun stuff elsewhere. your call!
supposedly, everyone who's been pranked by the seelie had angered it in some way...
alright, that's all the questions i have. your turn, please ask away.
my, my, who have we here?
you can have it your way. take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. is that accommodating enough for you?
it has to be nearby! let me go take a peek with my sharp eyes.
the memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. but when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
b--but we can't just run away like this, right...
alright then, let's meet up here tomorrow. i really hope the seelie replies.
look after twirly-whirly for me... take him with you to the top!
really? that's great. you're helping with all the things that i used to do for her.
ha! i finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. oh, i must say it feels good.
hi there, do you know anything about the wisdom seelie?
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be... heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
i'm still worried about the owner. let's go check on her.
the grand notion of eternity she once held has long since given way to the eternity of her own definition.
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
in short, if everything goes according to plan, they may yet prove to be helpful.
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
the atmosphere here is so different now... it's so lively!
the puppets are gathering around the frame. are they expecting us to enter it?
who knows? i don't remember anything before that.
whew, good thing azzam was willing to hear me out...
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
of course we wanna help... we care about other people too y'know.
that's right, i'm the sword champion...
ah, by "newbie" you mean me, right?
ah, no... i was just up late last night reading some novels... what does sleeping in have to do with the weather?
what a childish conversation this is.
any funny antics in the house of daena will get you escorted out... or perhaps thrown out.
i'm sorry, you two. i didn't mean to bring up any sad memories...
we didn't have anything to hide in belobog, either...
could you please get off my case!? i don't know what's gotten into you today. i'm making an effort here, you could at least try to do the same.
my, my. yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. i like it very much.
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards... we didn't meet seele until way later.
is... this the guide?
about time i got some credit for it!
(all of their wishes actually did come true...)
oh please, do your worst~ i never asked souka to win in the first place. besides, maybe suffering a humiliating defeat will give her the epiphany she so desperately needs.
he began to simulate mild fragmentum corrosion, thinking that it could lead to breakthroughs in developing blizzard immunity.
good news, everyone -- it's done! the opera epiclese is booked.
anyway, get ready! lights, kamera, action!
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
a great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the yae publishing house's ace in the hole. and i would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
hmph, then... i can guess neuvillette and clorinde's parts.
hehe, i'll pretend i didn't hear that.
yikes, sweet talk alert... but it's true, thank you, mister giovanni!
hmm, something tells me you just want to finish the free desserts before we break for the day...
i knew his research in the overworld wasn't going well. i used to write to him and ask him to come down and stay with the kids in the orphanage for a while. i thought it might help take his mind off his research.
of course not! what were you thinking?
just a suggestion though -- you're safe as long as you stick with me~!
the auction... right hook? the one at the vagrant camp?
...alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you... for now.
sampo's gone to clear up a mess of his own making, so i'm looking after you in the meantime. based on your current state, i don't think there's any cause for alarm -- you seem perfectly healthy.
took you long enough sleepy head. we've been waiting all day!
but have you really been enlightened with new ideas? or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
but now that i think about it, it really was quite dangerous. thank goodness nothing bad ever happened...
considering you two, i think you should have no problem making it to the end.
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city... no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
i was shy! talking about personal stuff like that in front of everyone... it'd be too embarrassing!
so, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
ah, i see. heh, this setup is quite handy. saves me a lot of work.
look, he's still talking to that cowboy!
as one who is thrown into the sea, though he fights back desperately against his predicament, it does nothing to prevent his descent into the depths.
should you be able to lay down a new stretch of silver rail, the express may never have to worry about energy ever again.
everything alright? you feeling okay?
oh? am i really so terrifying? well then, i'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up...
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
(...he's sure saying some weird stuff.)
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future...
i've watched furuyama brew tea on many occasions... i doubt i should have any major problems doing it myself.
huh? is his past really that dark?
a--ah, no no no, that's not what i meant...
i thought... i thought we were going to fail. i thought that... everything we did and all the time we spent was for nothing...
a patient's medicine doesn't just reveal their illness. it also offers a window into their desires and needs.
let me first be clear that i'm not taking guests at this time. so if you're just here to clown around, then please be on your way! shoo!
i used to enjoy visiting the rainforest... but it's been a while since i've been there. maybe a lot has changed...
aren't there... other crew members we can take inspiration from?
issuing free medicine to the needy was just vache's way of conducting experiments on his test subjects.
anti-raiden shogun training. i've prepared a special program, just for you. come along now.
i understand... thanks, master gongshu!
no -- is this not a "memory"?
recording and comparing data will be much easier now that we have this device. i can do it all on my own, too.
there's that huge pillar called the furnace core that's always in view -- maybe it's some kind of energy hub?
let's do this! great mine, here we come!
oh! uh, i mean, you're so nice and all, and everything here just makes me feel so comfortable...
nice! you found footage of him leaving?
can you see the express in boulder town? why does it fly in the sky? who is the conductor?
no... so my teddy bears and bunnies are gonna be liquefied by stomach acid? i've had them for ages... i need to find a way to save them.
i can't always rely on this gizmo to communicate with twirly-whirly. it makes me feel like i'm giving orders...
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
it's futile trying to escape. anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. after all... you did summon it together.
aaaah! ugh, honestly, what is he doing! he should have run that by me first...
when people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. sampo's first and second laws of motion.
goodness, i presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
not quite yet. but thanks to you, we might be able to use this opportunity to get to know each other a little bit better.
you just want us to buy your things! this is extortion!
haha, how could i forget about you two? we couldn't have done it without your help.
okay. grab the kamera, and i'll give you a scenario.
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
i don't wanna get to the end so soon... i want my journey to go on forever.
thunder's roar and lightning's flash. so ephemeral. this is why reaching eternity is desirable. ...actually, no -- this is why reaching eternity is necessary.
as it stands, the votes are even. your opinion will make all the difference.
it seems i'm the one who came out on top this time, hehe. i'm actually quite enjoying myself... how about we go for another round?
...still better than just standing there like a scarecrow!
you mentioned earlier that the troupe was like your "home"...
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
are you worried about those two? welt is with them. they should be fine.
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
you guys must be exhausted standing here all day. how about you take a little lunch break -- i'm sure the ipc allows that, right?
you wanted criminals sure know how to look on the bright side of things...
no, it's not like that. if it's daytime, all i need is an astrolabe...
well then, does that answer all your questions?
doctor natasha said that she's a handful, but that she also takes care of the homeless kids. maybe she's more mature than she seems?
ah, the one from chioriya boutique! hello, hello.
pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
so it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
people show you whatever side of themselves they want you to see. i know this for a fact.
i'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
yeah, i'm ready... but please go easy on me!
(that really doesn't sound like the kind of childhood someone should have...)
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
what? but we've done a whole day's work -- what's the sun playing at? it felt like we spent the whole day in the palace of astrum.
okay, looks like we've learned all the essentials -- let the fun begin!
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
trailblazing to a world that even akivili has never been to... is that possible?
hey, i said over to you! you can't back out now!
besides, the yae publishing house will need your help with the illustrations again next time, mister calx. you could also consider it as my investment in you.
whoa! stop! ah! stop, stop, stop! there's a big evil hunk of metal right there!
by the way, where's yunli?
hey, the guide is on the move, let's keep up!
foolish question. there are only two kinds of things -- those that must be done and those that must not.
but the problem is: on the eve of the charmony festival opening, how exactly are we going to get close to the theater? family security will be airtight, and if we brute force it... even if we succeed, it's too risky.
fear not, unless i wipe away your memories, forgetting me is not an option~
every action undertaken is for the sake of resisting erosion.
thanks, miss asta. but i... i'm not sure i should...
...stellaron hunter: sam.
with that thought, there is only one choice: let the bloodhounds send him back home! this person deserves to be punished!
oh, but back to the topic of wrapping up... shouldn't you be getting back to the action to record how everything plays out? last one, then the round's over.
they're already awake in their rooms. will you be comfortable in following me now? time waits for no one. we must hurry to the lobby.
but you're talking about real evil.
oh come on, you know that's what you want deep down inside. i can see it on your face.
it is not destiny that shapes us, but we who shape destiny.
however, thanks to your memories, now we still have a chance to turn the tide.
if the difficulties are purely financial, then there must be a solution. you could put the shows on pause while you look for a sponsor, for instance.
yeah... but oddly enough, when i wake up, all the things i was stressing over are taken care of.
maybe the seelie didn't prepare anything for us this time? or, does it want us to knock on the door first...
the result being that in the centuries since their sacrifice, i have dishonored their will.
the events of five hundred years ago not only robbed me of my friend, kitsune saiguu... they also took makoto away from me for good.
...i'd probably choose to ask the bloodhounds to cease their pursuit.
(is he talking about how no one in the capital seems to remember the hunters and their legacy? i didn't expect the script to contain this level of social criticism...)
what do you think, hook? are you willing to buy the geomarrow probe from me?
what a frightened look you have. don't worry. since this has nothing to do with you, i won't be suspecting you of anything. why don't you come take a stroll with me?
then i'll leave that to you. macaroni's on sale today, so i've got to go. you can just tell me how things went when we discuss tomorrow's plan later.
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
confidence goes a long way.
ahem... i'm quite alright. just feeling a little stiff.
it's someone you know. wanna take a guess?
fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
don't be surprised. my job is just to help everyone make the right calls.
did the medicine have any side effects for you?
she even factored my immaturity into her plan.
never mind who they are, let's just film them.
which is why we sought you out, to help the astral express save the world together.
look around you. the grass grows green and lush and a soft breeze blows. this is inazuma at peace, as you will no doubt remember.
on stage, the lead role is the focal point of the audience's attention, and you're all used to seeing the director as the heart of the troupe.
yes... looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place... you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
since my physical form is here in this realm, i suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.
okay, that's enough! in times like this, we should be trying to give each other hope!
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool...
yeah, i think that's what tighnari was trying to tell me.
hehe... the most important thing is that it's fun. in light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. wouldn't you agree?
and there you have it, that's the truth behind what happened...
"sacrificed herself," huh... sure. yeah. that's the whole story...
h--hold on! we'll find someone to help...
no worries, just thought you might be interested.
ooh, wow! your first guess, and you got it absolutely...
this may not sound like me, but... i hope that deity the architects worship can grant us some luck.
a paper flower? it's beautiful... did luocha make this?
i'm not sad. it's just that... this dream is so loving and forgiving.
it's the title page of the angler mystery!
that's a lot of information to take in. sorry, both of you -- i know you're in a hurry, but i need a moment to think.
well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. i'm natasha -- a doctor in the underground. you've already spent a day in my clinic.
infiltrating the house of daena was a total accident. she'd forgotten an important book, and the house of daena happened to be closed at the time. there were only days before the paper was due.
hehe, you should prepare yourself. i certainly won't go easy on you.
huh. so it's selling slowly? why is that?
(what should i say... to most appear like a god? to be honest, i still don't know. perhaps i should first try to act natural...)
are you finally going to tell us?
turns out, pom-pom's been silently putting in a lot of work for us, wow...
okay, i think i've got it now...
during the course of finding memories, a picture is worth a thousand words.
come on, say something already.
no way, i won't let him off the hook, because i'm despicable, remember?
this game will be over soon... this time, we're going to catch her.
what's that supposed to mean?! you'd better believe it!
of course you may, but you'll have to be prepared to fall asleep very quickly.
(but... if things don't play out as expected, the people of fontaine will be the ones to pay the price...!)
i've been watching her closely for a while now, and the first "invitation" was in the banquet hall of the hotel.
ahaha, yes, ours was as far from a close call as you could get. all it took was a few short, sharp strikes for blitzara and i...
i'm... sorry to hear that. i wish there was something i could do...
i was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. it seems she was quite frightened, too.
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
huh... do you think svarog and clara felt the effects of our battle with the guardian?
calm down. the war you speak of is over.
"take a photo"...? once again, i'm faced with a combination of words that makes absolutely no sense to me.
they should all be things i can use... i think.
...and then began again.
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side... maybe even the same person.
let's go, i think this conversation's run its course...
yeah! grand champs in the house!
i once felt regret for those that were lost without a trace, but fortunately, we were later able to sense, discover, and preserve them.
now... we should have a way of dealing with those baddies.
true... if someone from the alchemy commission was suggesting it could be done, then there's always a possibility.
but i want to help, i can't just sit back and watch you while you fight. don't worry, i can handle myself.
i guess we're done...
...are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
i remember giving you junjun. i haven't seen this fella in years. where did you find him?
even though the filming process proved to be extremely challenging, everyone provided valuable and unique contributions to the final product. thank you all for your dedication and support!
...then good luck persuading that mass of metal.
so she asked someone to look after the shop for her... but where are they? looks like they must have left too.
equally unforgettable, i'm sure. anyway, don't worry about the future -- live in the moment!
my, my! you really know what appeals to my tastes, don't you..
from a director's point of view, i also felt like the relationship between the two musketeers in the original story could be improved.
check out this bottle. the liquid inside looks beautiful, and the label reads... dream syrup (thick). i don't see an expiration date, but the production date is...
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps...
huh, mister assistant detective? you seem to be getting anxious?
so, even the mighty stellaron hunter is willing to admit defeat, huh...
i feel a little awkward taking it by myself. would you like to join me? let's commemorate this moment.
i see. you decided to admit to your feelings in an effort to bring me down with you...
hmm, that "place downstream" could be somewhere close by.
before our next expedition, i need himeko to teach me some negotiation skills. beating people up all the time is cramping my elegance!
i don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for inazuma...
is that some kind of riddle? "reverence to the three talons..." what the heck does that mean?
"foreign object"? ...that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? i'll need your help with the ritual.
i'm fine, seriously. really! i...
...uh, i'm not sure it's as poetic as that...
is this lady... your friend too?
by the way, yanqing, where are we headed next?
yae publishing house will host an event next month, and we are looking for someone to dress up as a character from a light novel and interact with the fans.
huh!? there's someone else here? ugh... this is so unsettling! i can't see anything!
it's fine, she wouldn't mind. really, she wouldn't.
...wait, three? there is a third person seeking the way to the lobby? wait... it's...
someone's full of energy! you... don't look like a xianzh--
my brother does wear an identical necklace... do you know him?
miss robin's courage is admirable. and here i was, thinking she was just another superstar celebrity...
the strength gained through my own hard work is truly fulfilling. hehe, thanks for your support.
saved... your soldiers?
i don't really think bad students would come to the house of daena to pass the time... but anyways, you were saying?
i'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
i didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was... she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
before pursuing the eternity of her nation, she had to reach eternity for herself.
"unlikely, potential..." meaning there could still be conflicts...
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
she's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
well, we don't want to act in haste before the situation has stabilized. we need to wait for the right time.
oh? what's with these looks? perhaps the welcoming ceremony still isn't enough? hmm, what else should i say then?
i mean... yeah? wanna check it out on the way?
...that won't be necessary, but it will help if you pretend to be a patient. help me investigate this so-called "mutual aid society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
ah! you're just in time -- we haven't taken our selfie today.
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
nah~ i was just imagining all the fun we're gonna have here... hee-hee!
ugh, why don't you go and marry her, huh?
...julian? quick, let's go see!
i thought things were finally looking up as i managed to dodge prison during my recent trailblazing expeditions! but now it looks like i'll be back behind bars again...
with her help, we'll be able to ease the underworld's medical supply shortage. that's good news for patients who'd lost hope.
but... you found them in some ancient ruins, you say?
...alright, alright, i'm coming. no need to drag me!
am i really that important to someone...? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories...
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so... wanna come with us?
(it seems like every character included in the script has a certain amount of useful information to offer. if we keep asking questions, we might be able to get some good leads.)
trailblazers... first time anyone's called us that on this planet!
though your blade has been cleansed of her blood and filth, never shall it shine as brightly as it once did.
that's not a ceiling, hook... that's the sky.
*groan* if we're wrong about this, it'll be super awkward...
*yawn* dear, dear. other players lose their games and throw a tantrum... you win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
okay, let's go and try our luck.
so that was just a hallucination? huh, why do i feel kinda disappointed...
wait! can you recommend some sights? it's not that late, we wanna take a look around.
an--and then what happened??
with pleasure. i'll give you a general overview. *ahem* you're probably aware that astrologists rely on the movements of the celestial bodies to calculate the past and the future.
looks like things are getting heated. i think we'd better get outta here.
that sounds like what others have said. but i don't have the time to wait for a reply if the seelie doesn't answer right away...
(this is a good spot for a fire. even if the fire was to spread, it'd be easy to contain.)
hehe, you're right. people still rely on me as their doctor.
all i can do right now is hope that it helps me...
miss hu tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? sure, i'll take one.
ugh... i don't wanna see a bunch of marches roaming around the express! one of me is enough!
wait! wasn't there some big energy hub-looking thing back in that empty area? let's go back and take a look, maybe it's linked to this gate.
seele has been like this since she was little -- impulsive and eager to be the best. for people who don't know her, they might find her... difficult...
hehe. you are the most important part of the plan. i know what i'm doing. you don't think i'd leave you with no chance to win at all, do you?
got it. he says the wind is too strong here at the port, so it's not easy to follow the scent.
you bet! the interastral peace broadcast recently did a whole segment about your glorious achievements!
hmph... who gave you that idea? was it the knave? you'd sink so low as to use a harbinger's words against me?
oh, okay. hurry up then. we'll leave when you're ready.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
when there are no acting gigs, i work as a guide near glaux avenue. if you don't mind, i can show you all the exciting things around here! maybe if i do my job as a guide, people will stop suspecting me...
morning. you look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? what mischief were you up to last night, hmm?
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to...
so, tell me. what is the matter?
well, you can find all kinds of local delicacies here -- clockie pizza, oak cake rolls, alfalfa salad, and the classic soulglad! feel free to pick anything you like! today it's my treat!
at least she's not trying to arrest us anymore.
he wanted to go investigating on his own, so i let him~
hehe, then it's a deal.
deal. i can't believe you won such a valuable item. junjun must have fetched a small fortune, huh?
take a deep breath, and visualize the dreamscape's outline in your heart. and remember... you must not open your eyes at all times.
yeah, we'd never team up with someone like him!
i'll come and have a seat here more often, if you don't mind.
the thesis i'm working on this time aims to address the remaining triple-orbit problems, as well as eliminate a portion of the methodology's limitations, which will make it easier to use.
oh! so, it would be like... like experiencing a different life, but still as yourself? that's not a bad idea.
haha, i'm grateful.
hmm... i have high hopes for you, child. don't disappoint me.
it took longer than i had hoped, and by the time we made it back here, the treasure hoarders and the family were gone...
ah... haha... okay...
tell me. aren't you and lynette actually from the house of the hearth?
paimon, please. "who wrote this book, and why? don't we think there might be a bigger safety risk here?"
...forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
an "ambition" is a yearning for something material, or a concrete outcome. it is finite in nature, and will be replaced by a new ambition in due course.
i see... let's go somewhere else then.
...to penacony's past, present, future... and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
hmph, you're the one getting excited... my first detective case! finally, my intelligence and wisdom have a chance to shine!
oh, my darling clapper loader and kamera operator! you've both worked really hard.
anyway, you should watch and learn, because i plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that divine priestess from watatsumi island.
huh? it's a... picture?
it's nothing, it just feels like people are getting along better since your unannounced disappearance...
...the stage is set, this is our moment.
wow, that's a pretty incredible story. so... does that mean topaz's "business" here is to collect a debt from belobog?
ahh... wh--what? what is this place...
how did it go? did you find the film?
not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. she always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
biological tissue? does this crate contain living things?
kamera operator? that can be a pretty technical job, and it directly affects the final quality of the film. are you really up to it?
hey, have you forgotten your manners?
if you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
this is the end. you have won.
hey, i've never missed my target!
*sigh* come now, was i not just at the opera house in person? leave these kinds of things to neuvillette.
moving forward inevitably invites further loss, but also new encounters.
i would not try to change her if it wasn't necessary.
i wonder why topaz would come to a place like this...
hehe... i assume you're hoping to take back a few moves.
you are unduly concerned. i'm simply conserving my energy.
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
it is a pity that i can't help her retrieve her lost memories.
the view here is wonderful. it smells of the rainforest here, and we're far enough away that no one will bother us.
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
...how old are you now, mister officer?
hehe, you mustn't judge a book by its cover, you know.
heh, so you would stick to mister lyney's defense even after knowing what you do now? you certainly have more professionalism than i thought.
huh? uh, um...
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon... no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence...
several people say that when they've walked by that lab at night, they heard the sound of someone sighing inside.
let's have some fun with our fungi friends, then take a break to sample some of sumeru's delectable snacks.
well, if that day comes...
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring...
so the mutual aid society found my bro-- ...vache's research results... and now they're selling this so-called "wonder medicine" to patients...?
let's split up and ask around about the seelie. hopefully someone knows something more.
maybe, but the ones outside just seem like a waste of energy.
ah, boss, see these two faces here? remember them. they're the ones picking up the bill later.
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
hehe, don't you worry about that, urakusai. arrangements are being made.
when ayato approached me about holding the test of courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help chizuru face her problem.
must we, really? i should think that of anyone, your friend lyney already knows this truth very well...
hey, you're gonna take it!? yinshu, this isn't your fault -- you don't have to do this.
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream... we can just head to the place i mentioned later...
huh? ah... ahem! why are you looking at me like that? is something the matter? if there's nothing urgent, then i shall be retiring for now.
...might i remind you that i am not here to amuse myself.
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
a--are you backing out now!? we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
now who should i send... hmm... miyuki, perhaps?
roger that -- you can leave the rest to us. if everything goes smoothly... this should be wildfire's final mission.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land... must have been real too, right?
did they just call us? look at their outfits... they're from penacony, right?
no, forget about winning or losing, layla! it'll be fun either way!
that's right, i mean you, traveler. you'll support lyney, won't you? after all, he was the one who helped you the first time we met.
inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. hmph.
*sigh* even mister yang looks surprised -- that's not something you see every day.
besides, ordinary computers don't have cool backstories. technology handed down from nous, huh...
...she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
in her arms she was carrying a little fox on the brink of death. she knelt before kitsune saiguu and begged her to save her friend.
...i have no idea what you're talking about.
n--no, that's not what i meant...
i thought that the story between you and the fungi would follow a master-servant paradigm, but you offered something even better: companionship, based on mutual understanding.
the memokeeper on the express...
still, the ice that trapped me was six-phased ice -- a very rare substance. i don't think you can find it on your average planet...
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
the queen's crown still doesn't have a sequel yet? pity, a classic like that where justice overcomes evil never gets old.
miss fu xuan? is that you?
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you...
*sigh* i may not be for long.
go on. open it up, show me what's inside.
she spends all her time alone. having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
is that a dragon!?
...ugh, didn't i tell you? all our negotiations end in combat!
ah... i was wondering if we might run into her...
to be honest, i never understood how he'd achieve that "blizzard immunity." but i do admire that vision and perseverance... i always chose to believe him, ever since i was a kid.
it is true that i did not know why the oratrice gave out a guilty verdict that day.
no, yoimiya! you have to stay here.
(lady bonajade? i think i've heard that name somewhere before... was it from silver wolf?)
simple. it wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? so we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them... but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
come on, everyone. allons-y.
serval, pela! has it really been that long!?
the trial of time... i hope it won't waste too much of our time.
don't let her carefree nature fool you -- she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
if the seelie is trying to make me remember things that happened in the past, it would make the most sense for it to hide clues in memorable locations.
something i've begun to realize since my departure from the opera epiclese is that there's a lot you don't see when you observe everything from on high.
i think you made the right decision. still, it means i'm going to have to draw up a detailed dosage plan.
he thinks he's dead... although when i first fell in, i also thought the same.
i'll do my best! i wanna learn all about twirly-whirly's likes and dislikes, then buy lots of snacks from the almighty merchant...
the moon is simply magnificent tonight. we mustn't squander it. come, join me for a moonlight stroll -- i won't take no for an answer.
it's so dangerous, don't you worry about him?
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
ode to fool... this must be the second act.
i've been reminded of many people, too. kitsune saiguu, makoto, and all the other friends who i watched pass even further back.
there's a familiarity to the scent in the air and the firmness beneath my feet... mmm...
but the way i see it, his situation is much worse than my other self's... she just hadn't found what she wanted to do at that moment, which is why she felt lost.
...dan heng, wanna... talk about mister yang's findings?
...memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
right on! i'm stealing that!
if we want to get our evidence, we're going to need some help. now... come with me. we must awaken the professional.
excellent work. you've figured it all out.
each year for their anniversary, my dad would send my mom a bouquet of ball peonies wrapped in red paper.
that final battle especially! all the effects were super realistic.
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
the garden of recollection has eyes everywhere. if he wants to hurt you, he'll have to fight against the memokeepers -- i've warned him about that.
gifts must have an element of surprise -- just treat it as a part of life!
at this stage, let's revisit that scene from lyney's perspective.
but then again, i know you'd be able to see right through those words... i'm feeling weak, there's no hiding it.
(that lady bonajade feels more like a... moneylender rather than the owner of a pawnshop.)
th--then, may i ask some questions? in my opinion, we primarily need to determine two things...
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall...
forget it, i don't kick people when they're down, even if they annoy me.
it's completely blocked by the mine cart... what do we do? can we blow it up?
mm... that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
to put it simply, makoto wasn't concerned about outcomes.
the... the emergency response plan is also strictly confidential.
hmm... after doing my shopping, i'll get all dolled up in an evening gown to attend miss robin's show at penacony grand theater!
so... how about you hand that "small parting gift" back to me? i'm quite eager to have it back.
looks like i passed the test, right?
as always, to follow in the footsteps of akivili.
aww, what are you talking about? the fun's just about to begin.
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
anyway. i'm only telling you this to stop you worrying, so that you can focus... on something i need you to do for me.
just trust in me, your archon, and do as i say -- never mind whether you can truly convince yourself to or not. it'll all turn out fine.
understood, miss march. i promise you, you'll never see me in your room while you're taking a break.
as long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
the express has faced all kinds of obstacles on its journey -- today is just another one. it's no reason to stop trailblazing.
cloudford victory zone -- here we come!
time for dessert. what? why not? what do you mean, "entrees come first"? ...they were only indulging me because i am the shogun? huh, interesting.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
aventurine is telling the truth. this "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
to be brutally honest... for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
huh... you're right, though. i should make an effort to get out more.
okay, that's positive. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
i'm surprised, too.
oh no, they saw right through it...
jumping through all those hoops in the matrix was pretty exhausting, but this little gift makes me feel like it was worth it.
oh, did i mention? ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the grand narukami shrine.
first things first. follow me to the entrance.
that's right, i'm the first one, he's the second! we're here to help!
that cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. if she detects any change in the underworld, i don't know what she might resort to...
this way, i can always be attuned to your location, ready to assist immediately if you encounter any threats.
descendant of the kujou clan. regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the kujou name.
no murder case this time around?
oh, don't worry. i've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
then how should i rest? i definitely won't be able to sleep... as soon as i close my eyes, all kinds of thoughts start floating into my head.
they would be under neuvillette's jurisdiction. unfortunately, i uh... don't have any connection with them at all.
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear...
in the end, we still came full circle.
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet...
huh!? you mean that stellarons can communicate? i've never heard that before...
maybe that's why the trailblaze chose such a look.
wow! suddenly, i don't feel so tired.
(i'll find out for myself if the rumors are true or not.)
my time to move freely is quite limited, so it's only natural that i would punish the people attempting to waste my time.
are you okay?
oh. so what? you did offer to treat me to a meal, didn't you? anyway, i am something of a vip, you know. wouldn't you find it embarrassing to treat me anything short of lavishly?
oooh... i wonder if it's gonna be a big one?!
you... weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you...?
*sigh* it was just an analogy... an analogy, okay?
oh, your teddy bear? hehe... he's nearly done. here, take a look at him.
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
th--that was so scary! it was like a long-lost twin sister had suddenly... appeared out of nowhere! i can't believe it was only a bug!
as you can imagine, the conclusions that the evidence points to are not mutually exclusive. which means... this is probably another prank from miss sparkle.
if his goal is that place as well, there won't be anything left there.
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know...
what have you done to him, mister tail?
sheesh, why do you keep asking me that? we're in the middle of investigating a murder case for the family. may we speak to your captain about it?
and, as a memokeeper, i also have to fulfill my responsibilities and harvest some interesting memories.
am i? maybe it's because i had the other shrine maidens leave. anyway, i've always been like this.
an entity formed with strong filth would be highly aggressive. but when purified, it presents in the form of a memory.
hmm, in that case, why don't we take a walk around the city, and see if we can learn anything from the local residents?
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out... and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek... do you get it?
time marches forward, heralding the arrival of a new chapter in the history of trailblazing expeditions.
...huh? is that my phone? must be the group chat.
let me see... ah! of course!
i'll take this weapon... since it used to belong to este. maybe it'll find comfort in being held by someone who appreciates the arts.
ah! the wall has vanished... feels like we're reaching the end... right?
there shall never be another. never, for the rest of time...
purified filth quickly dissipates and will be absorbed by the ley lines shortly afterwards. in other words, it cannot exist for too long.
or maybe you'd rather try this? i know, i know -- i normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
even though you couldn't see it through to the final scene, the audience was very impressed by your performance. it's safe to say that you made your mark on this memorial show.
positions, everyone! we'll move on to the next scene after we try a few more kamera angles.
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
(next up... i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm... he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
i still don't wish to pretend to be someone else, but i do have a desire to express myself... so maybe the show will go on for me after all.
when the flatbed trolley passed, he opened the box and got into an altercation with halsey, which caused the loud thud.
so it's literally a helping hand?
my father is a famous surgeon in belobog. because of his fame, people in medical circles paid great attention to his surgeries... he always had a lot of stress to deal with.
woohoo! the coast is clear!
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
...wowwww, i actually managed to get an ipc executive's phone number without even trying.
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
there were a lot of people waiting to borrow the celestial globe, and i wasn't able to extend my time slot. so i returned it and haven't been able to borrow it again since.
now, i'd love to hear your suggestions on how to defeat skott.
...i still haven't worked out how to convey it to you, the issues surrounding vache. my relationship with him... the things he's done in the underworld... it's a long story.
well, in that case, let's take a short breather here.
actually, i didn't need any answers -- he made them all up himself.
yeah, i wonder how many tickets... hey, that's not what we should be concerned about!
mhm, i do see your point. but are you sure you wish to do this?
hah! speak for yourself!
how many reports do i still have left to write...? four... oh, no, five...
...uh, i wasn't worried about you. if you must know, i was wondering if bronya was okay.
not yet -- don't forget the elite player that mister giovanni mentioned.
let's go -- can't keep a girl waiting, can we?
i can't shake the feeling that we missed something today. maybe i'm just overthinking...
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
this is why i wish to befriend all of you. a place where nightmares and sweet dreams intersect... the perfect cradle for the remembrance.
okay, okay, i won't push you -- everyone has their secrets. besides, given the circumstances, my curiosity can wait.
the one who hired you to come to penacony probably doesn't want you secretly linking up with other forces, right?
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
hmm... weird mask, strange vibes, a little out of touch...
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
such a long tunnel. didn't feel this long when i set off.
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
but... doesn't that mean everyone will die? i'm a fontainian just like them -- will i dissolve too?
oh? who permitted you to come onto this stage? now, i understand your admiration for my august self, but i must ask you to keep to the rules.
considering even their visions have been taken from them and embedded in the statue, they are ultimately quite helpless.
of course i've read it! i've always had a keen interest in artistic works that strike a chord with the populace.
consider this -- no one will lose their life on account of having their vision taken away...
poor guy. he was seriously injured and was all wrapped up in bandages to keep his good looks safe. if that's the case, then he couldn't have made it through the goldhammer residence's facial recognition system.
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars... as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
...hey, slow down! we still have questions that need answering!
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
other people might fall for that, but i won't!
oh, and by the way -- it'll be a woman's outfit.
what i mean to say is, you flatter me, mister zhongli.
if it wasn't for someone who's been helping me out, my adviser probably would have kicked me out of the darshan by now.
no, no, no... gepard is a captain of the silvermane guards, just like how the luofu has its own cloud knights captains. i have no idea what he's doing running security at a hotel like this though.
uh, eh-he... this interpretation is sounding a little odd... do we have any other evidence?
please stop, master yanqing and master yunli! i lost the duel, and now i have to accept the result. as a nameless, i don't want to be known as a sore loser.
so it's... made up? what's the point of that? without being grounded in reality, how can the story be believable?
but after the momentary numbness subsided, i found that my body was absolutely unscathed.
now for step three: yank out that anxiety and cast it away with all your might!
yeah! i'll show skott the power of the xianzhou swordplay that he despises!
this will be hard for the people that have come to rely on the wonder medicine... but it's up to us to remove this false hope.
"don't look back. keep going forward..." i get it! if i do the exact opposite -- i'll find my way out! you're a true genius, march.
ah, i have a feeling that our adaption will be even better than the original story!
with all this in mind, firefly and her companion -- there should only be one -- have entered this corridor together.
what's this... xianzhou clothing? it's so beautiful!
really! let's go catch up with him!
i can instantly tell which students are asking serious questions and which are just trying to take advantage of me to slack off.
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
one of the most classic challenges is to use three stars with shifting orbits to predict the overall changes that may have occurred.
r--really?
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia... he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair...
i should've known... don't quit your day job.
i know my brother he's -- meticulous when it comes to medical experiments. there's no way he wouldn't document his results.
i'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound... looked like its winged blade. we've all witnessed it in action before.
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
got it. he was just worried about me. relax, silver wolf. you know me.
here it is, just as i thought. the seelie must have placed it here in advance.
ugh, can't we run around to them for a change!?
a carefree stroll... i like the sound of that.
we heard about miss firefly from black swan... but we never expected miss robin to...
i'm sure you must have some things to discuss with her, too. i wish you all the best.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure...
huh, another challenge?
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
himeko really knows how to convince people. hehe, between leviathan fossils and the wardance, the latter definitely sounds more fun.
you start missing those moments once you leave them behind... and that's a part of moving forward.
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
my period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. i will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
unfortunately, that didn't really work out. instead, legends of "the seelie" started going around. hehe, but that's alright.
i bet that hacker kafka pals around with had a hand in it.
did he... succeed?
hey, what's that supposed to mean?!
it's all thanks to her that inazuma lived to see this day.
and here we are! the best viewing spot in all of golden hour! look, there's even a telescope here! when the charmony festival arrives, remember to be here early if you wanna get a seat.
i don't know. before i could figure out what was going on, it spat me out...
i... have been trying to do that...
it hasn't been around for long, but word of the seelie's existence spread like wildfire. many people have claimed that they've received a reply from it.
although, if clara hadn't been here... svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
seems a little out of the blue, but since you came all this way, it must be urgent. go ahead.
when i got back to the arena, i saw miss yae's opponent running away like they'd just seen a ghost... miss yae said she needed to find you and discuss something, so i came with her.
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
if what's in here is true, then vache must have built a lab somewhere in the snow plains... and even made progress in his research. but how can that be...
such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of eternity. i'm afraid i'll have to consider it further.
as plans go, changing the deity's mind is a huge gamble to begin with. we can't expect to be in control of every last detail when we're facing off against a god, can we?
before we departed, the conductor asked us to inquire about the three nameless in penacony. we've already collect intel about razalina and tiernan, so the only one left is legwork.
i'll give you a hint. it's to do with the yae publishing house.
the hint for the final question was a little too obvious.
no more unnerving gaze this time! hehe...
you can't change them? what does that mean...?
only the best! and i've learned a lot, too!
alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? good. we are running out of time, so let's get moving! chop chop!
i don't need any compensation. all i'd ask in return, if you're willing, is that you tell me some more about the life and work of your late director.
who are those two little guys?
this is also the only place where one can fully experience the core values of syrupism...
are you suggesting that the ipc has a remedy?
if you mess this up, it'll reflect poorly on me, too!
all in all, the mission is going super smoothly!
hehe, don't underestimate my experience. after watching a countless number of musicals, i've learned one important thing.
what did he say? that i'm good at solving people's problems?
i'm sorry, i'm not very knowledgeable in that area.
it was so grand and awe-inspiring... pictures of the city simply don't do it any justice.
as the god focalors -- the god of justice -- i shall do all within my power to lead you into an age of fairness and justice.
(maybe i should just go back...)
can't believe that worked. tampering with the dreamscape's gravity is clearly strictly forbidden...
i never knew pela had a strict side...
i stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
what was meant to happen did happen after all. everyone's dead...
mumbling?! i'm praying!
no need to thank me. it's a doctor's duty to heal.
how about it, this journey of beautiful dreams... was it to your liking?
come on. we'll need to get the go-ahead from neuvillette -- i know just where to find him.
i doubt i'll be able to sleep either... not that i don't trust you! it's just... you're a silvermane guard officer in the underground. there might be people looking to harm you.
hmm? is it a serious matter? maybe you'll... need our help in hunting down the borisin?
after the brilliant performance you put on, the reputation of your troupe is sure to spread through fontaine like wildfire. you won't have to disband if you don't want to.
hello, mister gallagher, sir. judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
i took a closer look, and the craftsmanship doesn't appear to resemble anything from this era. if i remember correctly, that style was last in vogue several hundred years ago.
i--i'm okay! let's do it! only way to find out is to give it a go!
hmm... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
please, tell me! you promised you'd help.
oh, that's right! mister zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
had i made all enemies of eternity stand against you, you still would not have wavered.
little white houses, plants exclusive to the desert climate... hmm... okay, i think i've got it.
i wasn't counting on running into other contestants here... maybe this is the end of the road for me. twirly-whirly on its own is no match for you...
she might start thinking about giving up completely, and that's the exact opposite of what i'm trying to do for her.
i don't know its name, and we have to keep our voices down in the house of daena, or else you'll get some scary glares from the mahamata.
how could a dream bubble be empty?
the wind that blows from afar carries fresh life to these shores...
...that memory zone meme, it is here as well.
yeah! we demand to speak with topaz!
hehe, let's do it. i already have an idea.
eeeeh!? you mean you won't come? no... no no no, that won't do! i can't go to the meeting alone, you have to accompany me, i must take you with me...
after all, you saw makoto in there, didn't you?
lyney did not need to take part in the dissolution of the young woman at all. indeed, he did leave the scene via the vent.
hey! would it kill you to play along?
of course, i have armed myself to do far more than smash your alibi. confidence cannot go unfounded, and my foundations are rock-solid.
hmph. who did that uncivilized rabble think they were, disturbing my enjoyment of the arts?
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
ugh... why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
oof, probably shouldn't have said that... might bring bad luck.
in this splendid metropolis, some have a dream called penacony, but some have dreams... that are no different from reality, even though everyone who comes here harbors the same motive in the beginning.
i know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
they're probably one and the same.
you should probably ask bronya to explain it to you.
...could you pretend like you didn't hear anything? now's not the time.
huh? my phone... himeko! there's something really weird happening!
i suspect the reason they're dragging their feet is that they have their doubts about whether the show will really go ahead, considering all the issues you've been facing.
well, let's have a look.
but every encounter i've had since coming aboard the express has been strange to say the least.
we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
what? you just matched up those symbols. is that it?
exactly! ...huh? w--wait! that's not the point!
uh... ahem, hello one and all. i couldn't help but overhear your conversation just now...
next time, i think i should be the one trailblazing with you guys -- welt can stay on the express.
if only himeko could come with us...
also, does miss topaz even approve of your so-called "support squad"?
besides, being a leader is hard. it wasn't the right job for me.
the next contest is starting soon -- let's go to the prep zone.
i have high hopes for this journey!
himeko must be gathering information. let's hurry up and get going.
really? i find that hard to believe...
the answer is simple -- he is the one fatal flaw that contradicts all our known information. this means that you, who wholeheartedly believe in this memory...
it seems kinda complicated...
oh, we should probably give these props back, right? i'll just leave mine here.
is it? i just want them to try it. it would be a shame for them to miss out on dango milk.
the original plan was for ei to simply discard it. but perhaps ei thought this to be too cruel, because in the end she chose only to seal the power within it.
yes, this is another case of possession -- only this time, whoever possessed him actively sought him out.
where's your sense of loyalty!? uh, that would be nice though...
today's training ends here. the qualifiers should be over now. we should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
i just hope it can help me get through this predicament.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
...no way! i won't let you!
no one can remain undefeated for an eternity...
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
but in her own life, her greatest desire wasn't to be the center of attention... i can tell how much she loved you all, and how much she loved the troupe.
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
after all, a life with no obstacles tends to narrow the mind. people end up believing that only they are on the right path. sometimes, obstacles are more valuable than smooth sailing.
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
and then he runs to the dock and picks up some luggage?
miss topaz, bronya's already told us about belobog's debt situation...
they may be tiny, but when they go buzzing right by your ear in the dead of the night... bzzt! ugh, it's so annoying.
the best option was for her to directly interact with humans. there's no need to feel sad, i believe she was content when she left us.
the statue... is that...
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
however, her unpredictable and variable sleep patterns are completely out of my control, so i have to make every second count.
ready? lights, kamera, action!
...you've been spending too much time with hook.
"the nature of this memory is special. don't ruin the dreamscape experience for anyone else by spoiling the ending."
i understand. i shall become your shadow, just as you were once makoto's shadow.
hmm? wait a moment, child. you're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
what a pleasant surprise, truly an extra slice of joy.
that's a nice idea, paimon... but i'm from the rtawahist darshan. the kind of information i'm gathering now would only be of any use to someone in the amurta darshan.
or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what i wanted to do.
thank you so much, miss hu tao and mister zhongli.
flipping through this book is akin to personally listening to the guests' stories and their heartfelt wishes... yes, here it is. my message.
the test now is about body language... i don't think dialogue is allowed here.
...march, get dan heng.
ha. ha. you're a regular comedian...
not a chance. even if their heir was someone who showed promise, their past mistakes cannot be erased.
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
i'm good. let's do this.
well, although the fake "deaths" of those two ladies don't align with our initial assumptions, this fact itself doesn't contradict the information we have so far.
...entertainment for grownups?
it's getting worse again... but it's fine, i'm about to put an end to it all.
hmm, off to a most unfavorable start.
s--sorry for bothering you! please, i need your help...
where is mister shamari right now? i'd like to meet him.
hehe, that's our seele. nothing if not punctual. so, did you find any usable supplies?
i'll tell you what i mean by that if the seelie doesn't show up...
do you ever get the feeling that the ley lines have a regular flow, similar to the way that celestial bodies follow fixed orbits?
it's the oldest and most famous animation from penacony. it follows the adventurous life of clockie and his friends in the town of dreamville. to date, over ten thousand episodes have aired!
look out! enemies incoming!
the "script" hasn't reached its end yet -- we will meet again!
besides, there's no need to be nervous. this project is destined for success, i feel quite optimistic about it.
but now, i feel like i'm fully enjoying myself. it's really great. so, what are we doing next?
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
should i just give up? this is all... meaningless...
young people should be energetic! here, let's do some relaxation exercises.
huh? you want to help me?
and i am she who promised a dream to her subjects... raiden ei.
the theory sections are pretty much finished. i'll be able to finish organizing the rest on my own.
i should've been done with the first draft of my thesis by now, but i've barely written a third... *whimper*
yes. the true raiden shogun, who meditates endlessly in the plane of euthymia to preserve her being...
the heavenly principles... irrelevant nonsense as far as i am concerned.
there's a huge star in the sky and you're only interested in the clouds?
exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. fortunately, i've already managed to identify the author -- he's a failed light novelist named tomoyuki.
well, no time to dwell on that now. let's get back to filming.
i trust her judgment too, but...
whew, alright, it's decided... my mind needs a rest. so i'm not going to do anything, or worry about anything at all.
aha, the next treasure map just came in by text -- let's get a move on. we need to hunt down the next pass!
well, i was never beaten up by jing yuan in reality, either...
i'm gonna go write down my question. hopefully the seelie replies...
well, i'm off to my room then. express lights off!
sheesh... the logic in this plot and dialogue is really being pushed to its limits...
i almost thought i'd slipped into a fairy tale...
due to my lack of sleep, i sometimes get dizzy and faint when i'm stressed out...
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
hey, look where he was lying. what is that?
even though i am utterly unlike makoto, and can never become the person she was, i still need to do the things that she would have done.
a simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. it even allows me to verify my own existence.
humans long for freedom. if they go for too long without seeing the sky, they get ill... both in body and mind.
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
mister giovanni? seems like my hunch was right all along...
we don't have much time... may fate allow us to meet again, knight of beauty.
aw, come on, i'm really only asking you to finish what you started. besides... your paychecks are still in my hands. heh, heh, heh.
hehehe, oh, but i have so much to say to you. let me tell you all that has happened over the last few centuries.
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
i think i'll wait to see how this experience plays out first, especially when it comes to the quality of the script. if it's sufficiently fun, then i'll join.
a battleground... one where i shall sever ties with the past and take the first steps into the future.
can't believe you're in the mood to crack jokes...
even if he saw me, he wouldn't know who i am... he didn't notice me during the robbery.
splendid! more interesting trinkets for me.
she's getting better, though, isn't she? it's apparent how hard she's working now.
and what was that fire that came out of her? and her body -- where did it go?
yes, and for that, i'm sorry.
no need to be so formal, i'm just a regular person like everyone else now. oh! is this fontinalia mousse? it's one of my favorites!
i've seen a lot and it's made me think a lot... i really can't praise it highly enough. i hope i will remember it for a long time to come.
ah, ahem...! speak your name, guard. why did you lead us here just to betray us?
exactly, we've got nowhere left to retreat.
the prescription's on this side, but on the back there's... huh? so that's what this is all about!?
this is a place i once sealed off with my own hands... the entrance to raiden makoto's realm of consciousness.
in principle, i should remain an outside observer. but you are far too much fun for that. i can't help but tease you from time to time.
...lastly, painkillers. there should be a bunch stored in the old lab. hopefully they haven't been destroyed by monsters...
they're definitely up to something bad. wait, they disappeared? let's catch up to them!
the next thing i knew, everything was covered with muddy water... me, and all my equipment.
consuming this would be physically detrimental. remove it from my presence.
yeah, yeah, you're in the footnote somewhere~
i think i'll just... take a quick nap... just a quick one...
we were just wondering if you could help us find somebody...
wait, seriously? can we do that?
...how imaginative...
alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the overworld and the underworld, right?
i think i must have been -- it's not every day you sew precious gems into a teddy bear. honestly...
i hope bronya takes these words seriously.
i'll let you know if i find out anything. consider it part of my means of thanking you.
ha, even dan heng the sensible has his adventurous days!
i especially like the head of the club. great character design. she really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. i can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. approved!
don't worry! if you eat like dan heng, you'll be as tall as him one day! *stifled laughter*
were... were you upset, clorinde?
hehe, far from it, haniyyah. i know full well how serious you are about all this from your iron-clad determination to annihilate an entire species... how would i ever dare mock you?
i, furina, will use this trial to show the world the true meaning of justice!
no need, why don't you just take us to the city? we don't really know the way.
i said... why not?
...oh, there you are. sorry, i got distracted watching the crowds.
um... i didn't understand a word of what you just said.
i know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. i don't want anything bad to happen to her.
i would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
it's like i told you -- i have a severe sleeping disorder... and there have been a lot of rumors about me sleepwalking.
hmhm! speaking of secret moves, i've prepared some flaming potent tea.
three days... come back here in three days, and i will show you the evidence.
everything about home is filled with purity and passion. my memories of that place are wonderful. i never want to forget them.
i'm alright... so i wrote to the amurta students, and they were really keen. i got a reply with the information i needed within just a few hours.
all gods don't have the same secrets, you know. she was herself, and i'm me. is it really so strange that i know nothing?
how could this happen... miss robin...
but you can't bring yourself to do that, can you? you care too much about director aurelie and the home she built you all to let go.
well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. you're right on time, too.
trespassers are to be eliminated at once.
probably because the other contestants are coming up with their own ways to catch butterflies... alright, i'll do my best, too. huh?
if i can't learn swordplay well, i'll have no one to blame but myself.
ah, the opera's about to start. toodles!
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all...
huh? you mean idrila -- the one he wouldn't stop talking about? but... he said he'd find them... and fulfill his duty to protect them.
aha, you're learning, little one. but really, the truth of the matter is that i don't know much more about raiden makoto's realm of consciousness than you do.
don't go charging into the fragmentum again. mister fersman heard about what you did and came to me to find out what happened.
hehe... thanks for sticking with me through everything.
you must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
lefton's suspicion level can be downgraded.
of course, there's no doubt about that. so, i'll be sending someone i trust to go with you.
this scene is when our two characters return home only to discover their mother has been murdered. ready? lights, kamera, action!
oh, what a coincidence. i guess i just need to catch it now, right?
because she is a god. it's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
of course not. the memokeepers' divination techniques don't all involve memories.
hmm, i suppose that will do.
huh? but didn't you just say that you're a director?
you're right, but with seele by her side, i know she'll recover.
oh -- and i wish you a pleasant and enjoyable irodori festival.
mm... don't give me that look. it's just a game after all, and having fun should be your main concern.
so strange... the family insist that the dreamscape is absolutely safe.
seriously!? you actually speak trotter?
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
by the way, i'm curious. if my pay is so low, then what about our two lead actors? didn't they travel here all the way from inazuma?
my brain must be filling in the blanks... probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
...wouldn't it be lovely if these nosy newcomers found their way back home?
...it's true. i've been investigating the prophecy for hundreds of years.
well hello there, young ones. what brings you to the shrine? it just so happens that i have a wonderful novel here. i highly recommend it.
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
ugh, even then, humans only have so much strength. even if they do successfully summon a spirit with the incantation, it won't stay with them for very long. i really wouldn't fret about it.
but no... the more i think about it, it can't possibly be that simple.
i'm under a lot of pressure, and it really stresses me out... i don't know if i'm studying hard enough, or how my future will turn out...
seele's already become a capable adult -- i can't treat her like a child anymore.
scorching hot days and freezing cold nights... i--i don't think i'm gonna make it...
oh, come to think of it, i haven't seen twirly-whirly in a long time...
back at the yashiro commission, i kept the conversation reasonably light-hearted. but now... i'd like to broach a heavier topic, if i may.
...a life born in the memory zone could never manifest in reality. so, why did he appear in the reverie hotel in reality?
so i won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. what matters is that i tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
eternity is a concept intimately connected with time. when you begin to touch on eternity, the concept of time becomes murky.
don't worry, mister oleg, we'll make sure you don't regret it!
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
mm, everyone's working hard for the bigger picture...
the annihilation gang, that band of desperadoes who all disappeared after meeting you... what exactly happened to them? well, let me reveal all.
the kujou clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. kamaji is hardly a great heir to the kujou name, but...
well, here's the thing. even if skott apologizes, do you think he'd actually feel sorry for what he did?
is this really the right place...? it's so quiet all of a sudden.
that guy just casually throws this kind of question at us? what exactly is his deal? but fine, i'll answer i guess...
i'll do my best... when i get back, i'll write a letter and send it to the amurta.
oleg and i took vache to the overworld. he made his final request to us: to take him outside the city to the snow plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
i won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
hehe, well, at least i was smart enough to figure that out...
by the harbor's grace, a lone boat lies in rest, let the moon give chase, for here begins our quest.
mm, i'm sure.
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
hahaha, believe me, even if she were to end up at rock bottom, she'd find a way to somehow laugh it off as one of her silly mistakes and climb her way out.
of course, i know everyone here. on penacony, anyone could be lying... but the remembrance does not lie.
alright, alright, let's save the awards speech for later, and hopefully also get some rehearsals in before the real thing.
i suppose everyone who likes to bask in the light will be drawn to that kind of warmth...
what i take from these stories is not so much the content itself, but what they represent in terms of the effects of time upon inazuma.
so... should we tell everyone the deal?
i think, each and every one of us is searching for the answer to this very question.
aha! i found something. "to whoever discovers this diary"... let's see...
don't worry, the express crew keeps its promises. we won't disappoint you.
you do? good... i mean, it's good to know someone in this world feels the same way as me.
she had already lapsed into unconsciousness by that point, so all i could do was enter into her mind... as far as you're concerned, it would be somewhere similar to the plane of euthymia.
he did not realize that this sound could be heard by everyone in the opera house, which is why he claimed earlier that he could not hear the sound.
hmph, i should've known you'd listen to that stellaron hunter. whatever -- but you should think before you do that.
that's good to hear. otherwise, given that i am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
i am, in fact, after the watchmaker's legacy, but that doesn't mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. but at least... i hope things won't turn out that way.
at least we know who to look for next. we can ask the bloodhound family for information.
...the votes are completely even! ugh, i don't know what to do -- both sides have really compelling arguments.
still, it's all just used test tubes, beakers, and other vessels. no sign of any sample reagents, or lab notes for that matter...
in which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. the god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
why are you two arguing again? i thought things had been improving between you lately...
...so how long does "copycatitis" last?
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
congratulations, you won! come on now, let's hear your victory speech.
it will be easier for us to start with someone from inazuma.
i'll be here washing the ingredients. can you please fetch some firewood for us?
(phew... i don't think i let anything slip today. i must show the people that there is nothing to worry about...)
hehe, well, maybe you should be worrying less about that and more about how exactly you are going to thank me... no?
...wow, that's a pretty convincing argument...
ahem, speaking of good sides with sake, i personally prefer fried tofu...
come on, neuvillette. there's no need to repeat all the unimportant legalese.
really? have they found anything?
is today the day of your creation? return to the city with me. i will read out a speech for you in front of all my attendants. "embarrassing"? ...understood.
anything special about that name?
by neither saying goodbye nor seeing me again, our relationship will remain forever how it was... in her mind, at least.
more curious than my appearance is the fact that she and i don't see each other anymore, wouldn't you say?
be careful though. don't get fooled by her again.
ah... general huaiyan's gone. wait, why does something feel off about what we talked about?!
huh? a supernatural tales anthology! sounds like a good bedtime read... might stop me daring to run to the bathroom at night though...
after seeing the letters mister oswell kept for me, i was hoping things might've ended differently. i shouldn't have asked you to come with me to such a dangerous place.
this area isn't for receiving guests, it's for unloading cargo! who decided to send us this way?
not to worry! mister giovanni will explain it all, right?
look -- that big guy down there -- is he the one in charge?
i must admit, though, i'm a little envious... they're quite fortunate to be able to bid farewell to their past in such a magnificent manner.
a magnificent, dramatic, and wondrous trial, a trial to end all things... ah, how could you hope to understand...
do i really look like that sort of person...?
vache... out of everyone in my family, i think he probably appreciated flowers the least.
everyone here is living a self-sufficient life... i don't know how to describe it, but this place feels like the real dreamscape...
you can't... you can't argue that just because a divine creation is flawed, that the god behind it must also be no god at all.
it is, isn't it? who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
i know what you're thinking, but i by no means plan to cross the boundary i've set for myself. besides, they're no longer looking for a replacement anyway.
you're right. children see the world as a place where anything is possible...
hehehehe...
look, miss sparkle has given us a puzzle where every single answer is correct.
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
you're saying... you like how i wear my vision? you certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. well then, i bet you'd like to pet it.
that's a shame, but i understand. just let me know if you ever change your mind.
well, since i'm here, i guess i should help her finish this. what are we supposed to be doing here again? finding a ley line disruptor, was it?
yes, but time's of the essence, so i have to take what i can get... sorry, i'm just making excuses...
that makes sense to me... monsieur neuvillette, i would consider this to be a reasonable investigative direction.
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because...
hehe~ ready or not, here i come, naughty children...
it's like stepping on planks floating on water.
before i lost my memory... so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
yes... she had such a great love for this land, and for its people. in this respect, i still do not compare to her.
pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. now you're trying blame it all on me?
anyway, just follow me. i'll save the story for when we get there.
you're right, i can't save everyone alone... but if i must, i would sacrifice food and sleep to treat them.
hehe. before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
okay, fine. then it's decided!
now that i think about it, perhaps i never needed to recommend that store to you in the first place.
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
let us return. we ought not keep furuyama waiting too long.
you've managed to make a guy like him turn over a new leaf. you're amazing, mister tail!
but, what cruel repercussion would this choice result in? i think, sunday must have been deeply impressed by the limitations of "the strong defending the weak" through this incident.
there's a mushroom here. you wanna jump on it to see what's up there?
i dunno... but how did it know about all these details? i've hardly told anyone about this stuff...
you don't know the half of it! those ipc mechs pack a huge punch!
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them...
as i stand here by the ship, i can't get the images of the rising water out of my mind...
i've been great, of course. every day is a happy one.
you're like a broken record...
nice! the crisis on this world is basically over, right?
perhaps "hope" means the desire to satisfy the eater.
good afternoon! where's my cake? what? i just had cake for breakfast? well, i think it's been long enough!
surely... you aren't planning to turn a blind eye to them?
i'm fine. i feel much better already.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
...did that all get a little heavy for you? i think you prefer me when i'm just teasing you, don't you? hehe...
yeah! what was so important?
...you gonna be this enthusiastic when it's jail-sentencing time?
such is the fate of us nameless, i suppose.
it can't be... it's happening again...?
y'know... i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request...
*cough* ahem, is that so? well, no wonder. this issue has reached the realm of the gods, after all. still, their spirit is praiseworthy.
what about you? are you all done already?
hey, dan heng, i thought all the xianzhou generals were like jing yuan...
there were actually more avidya leopards sleeping nearby, and they were all faster than me... i almost got bitten a couple of times.
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
it seemed like that kid was trapped in ice, but the substance doesn't share the same physical properties... how bizarre.
his last experiment was nearly two years ago. what happened after that? his notes seem to suggest he was working to improve blizzard immunity.
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
...what's he talking about?
ah, right. i knew about that even when she was still my subordinate.
you've also had conversations with the opera house's operating staff, right? didn't they want to increase the number of showings?
hey! he was just giving an example! i'm the nicest girl in the galaxy.
sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. you two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
then, how can i ask inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
we should be able to see more from up above, but how do we get up there?
"happiness belongs to the noble." does this mean we can take it? ahaha, doing good deeds does pay off! thank you!
this is a big town. where should we start?
but i've made up my mind. so i will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
the first one is clearly a result of your own doing... but i do admit to consuming the last serving of the express special.
i love their oak cake rolls! i get one from here every day!
(how is this minor? it's an important link in my deduction!)
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
alright then, let's go get our ticket to the championship!
all right, everyone. let's make a decision.
mister giovanni... again? what's he up to this time?
