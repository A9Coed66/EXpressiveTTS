sumeru city, huh... i guess it's even more impressive than here?
that's not what i meant. it's just a... figure of speech.
would you like to rest awhile at angel's share? it's our signature tavern.
shoulda, coulda, woulda, seele! activating the gear bridge alone would've been enough to expose us.
go ahead and talk to the buyers. they'll give you the answers you're looking for.
haha, only joking -- i'm needed in belobog. still, if i ever forget how to play the guitar or fix things in my workshop... there'll be a spot for me here, right? it's a deal!
the adventurers' guild? now that you mention it, someone once invited me to join them...
alright then. your turn now, my little friend. toss the salt, and then draw your sword.
let me ask you something -- do you know how long it took to make gears and wisdom from initial design to completion?
oh, dodoco? what an interesting name. i really like it.
miko, retract your words.
you wanted criminals sure know how to look on the bright side of things...
guests? i don't think they're here for tea...
it gets pretty boring from here on. i talked about the funeral parlor's past relationships with the guardian yakshas -- you know, just to be sociable.
good! seeing you so full of energy makes me less nervous, hehe.
as you are not from this world, i am unable to give you a prediction. all i can tell you is that your journey is far from over.
yep. that's exactly what he asked.
beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers... i wonder what exactly it is that the knights of beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
c'mon, let's go. we can't let anyone beat us to it!
pretty impressive... so if we encounter any problems, we'll know who to turn to for help~
i just need to keep my eyes and ears open while i'm helping charles with the tavern duties.
there's a device over there that appears to be waiting for us to approach it.
...it's almost like you're the host and i'm your guest. as a maid... i can't help but feel a little guilty!
okay, i'm ready to head back now.
hmm, speaking of that, i'm sure you're aware that a bunch of things have happened here in fontaine, right? i know you're not a local, but i'd avoid getting too close to any water that looks strange all the same.
"camellia petals fall to the ground, scattered among the raindrops of yesterday."
if anything else is unclear, you can ask baishi.
hey, are you on her side? i just wanted to remind her not to break her promise, that's all.
being attacked by savage monsters, losing goods and documents... isn't it times like these that people need help the most?
pfft, you were having plenty of fun playing the bad guy a moment ago. now you're trying blame it all on me?
aren't there... other crew members we can take inspiration from?
it doesn't have to be like that. i'm willing to answer all your questions, but not right now... if my cover hadn't been blown, we might have had more time, but at the moment, we don't have any other options.
i did, yes. you're paying, after all.
take some more exams? ...would that really help me?
ugh... the syrup has turned clumpy... i definitely don't want to drink this even if it's not expired.
it's not only the monsters that i am worried about. i'm concerned about what else might escape from the sacred sakura.
ah, great! in which case, i guess now i can tell you...
not much. as before, i can see the way forward, yet there are still contradictions.
i believe it's not something external, but something that originates within us, an emotion that traverses time from a certain moment of our past to reach us.
hmm... but you'd draw too much attention if you started speaking bananese too, dan heng.
...looks like we're not the only ones who wanted afternoon tea today though. we'll have to stand up for the time being.
i don't know what scheme northland bank has in the works, and i don't know what they're paying you.
oh, right! if you're gonna go find lynxy, you gotta know what she looks like!
there is some important information that i must pass on to you, supreme guardian. it is my hope that it will better equip you to make a wise and informed decision.
there's no need to worry, mister xavier. my brother and i had actually intended to work for free after receiving your invitation.
the ipc are all about their sci-fi sorcery, so it's not that surprising. wanna go take a look?
you seem tired. would you like some tea? i'll brew you some. do you take sugar? one cube, or two?
okay... i get it. i'll make a trip to qlipoth fort and tell bronya what i really think.
come now, no need to hurt anyone's feelings. besides, i specifically chose this place because i knew how much you like to drink.
the quest to plumb the wondrous depths of knowledge is indeed arduous...
what i can tell you is that i'm an astrologist, and that this prophecy concerns the fate of fontaine, even that of all teyvat. ascertaining this is akin to reading the fortune of the whole world.
though honesty may bring about resentment, i--i couldn't lie in the face of such a noble art.
oh, chairs! we can finally unwind for a bit.
uh... that's like naming your cat "cat."
dear me, that didn't frighten you, did it? after all, you are in the presence of the most supreme and terrifying incarnation of lightning in the whole of teyvat.
but in the information i received from the astral express, it states that we already reserved rooms. please check again for me.
it seems this "mikhail" is truly a seafarer and has nothing to do with the watchmaker.
as for cocolia, the best side of her will live on in people's memory. that's not all bad...
if you're not willing to communicate, then the problem just sits there. if you just keep staring at it without doing anything, eventually you'll watch every last opportunity to resolve it slip away before your eyes.
why did you not tell your companions about my true identity?
it belongs to the yashiro commission. a secret unit under kamisato ayato.
the heavenly principles... irrelevant nonsense as far as i am concerned.
next time, i think i should be the one trailblazing with you guys -- welt can stay on the express.
she shuts herself off in her inner world, leaving all the affairs of the outside world to be dealt with by a puppet who has a singular focus on the pursuit of eternity...
let's do this! great mine, here we come!
this isn't good... if what those kids said is true, then the museum thieves have operatives working in the settlement.
n--no, what made you think that? ahem... festivals are a common occurrence here in inazuma. we in the yashiro commission are very well acquainted with these sorts of customs.
that was really risky behavior! if those grownups had woken up, things could have gotten really dangerous for you two.
hey, i'm not actually gonna recite a poem! i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived on the xianzhou...
that's not written in the script, right? but as you see...
what do you know about this dog, thoma? everyone knows how well-connected you are.
patience. since the news made it out a few days ago, i have already had many people contacting me to declare an interest in joining the project.
what a stroke of luck! i didn't expect to get a break in the investigation so quickly!
oh, our apologies... this gentleman was just attacked by a monster and lost both his luggage and his goods.
the endless atrocities that osaru unleashed onto the world... just to build an evil realm where a hundred malevolent spirits prowl at night?
i must say, this is most intriguing...
i have never won against these fiendlings, for i am still but a mere ninja initiate.
let's just forget about that part. he's already in such a sorry state.
tell everyone about mother's true motives... about a lie perpetrated for seven hundred years...
it must be an inordinate number, which is why, now, mister aventurine, i have an investment that you absolutely cannot miss out on.
success! this way, the evil ninja's matrix can finally be broken.
i won't do anything crazy. i just want to wander around and see more of the world for myself. i want to buy some oak cake rolls. i've had a cake roll every day since i arrived in penacony, from the first day to the last.
ahem... mister charles, what i was really trying to ask was...
i thought your heightened perception was caused by something the elegant memokeeper might have left in your mind. now, it seems to me there are many more special beings like her in this dream.
you played the hand you were dealt masterfully. commendable.
also, we're not your friends. why should we care if a stellaron hunter is innocent, hmm~?
after all, you will most certainly need wisdom to turn limited ingredients into a dish that can keep you full for an entire day.
(*sigh* true. looks like using force isn't the right way...)
i understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. however, before that, it's essential to know that...
you don't have to believe us -- the astral express doesn't shout about its achievements! we'll look for your master.
speaking of which, master gongshu -- what do you make of them? you're the best artisan in the whole commission, maybe you can pick up on something?
hmm? whatever. let me ask you this, have you heard of any interesting new rumors lately? if so, i'd love to hear about them.
*sigh* am i to take it that the safety of the people of inazuma isn't so important in your eyes after all?
considering you two, i think you should have no problem making it to the end.
that guy's really taking it to a whole new level. does he really think he's a superstar or something?
i am me. there is only one of me, but i can exist in many different forms. it's not important what form i exist in.
what surprised me is how the freshness of the fish still shines through, despite how heavily seasoned the dish is...
i--i'm not complaining by the way! one adventure after another, that's exactly what i signed up for!
and look at that huge spinning sphere... where does it get its power? wait a sec, could it be one of those clockwork meka we've heard so much about?
are you kidding!? the history that this stone carries is of incalculable importance to belobog.
even in madam herta's space station, i never saw anything related to nous.
i, too, was once kept in someone's heart like you. those trivial moments, when looked back upon, are worth more than a thousand words... the past shapes who we are today. some things are hard to remember, others hard to forget.
do you think so? i was worried that it might be a little over-the-top... i'm not sure i can pull this off.
so, who exactly is this elite player?
it has been forbidden. *sigh* please refrain from making me talk any further.
...this is definitely my mirage. only here can i see extraordinary sights like these.
but let's stay calm until we're one hundred% sure.
still, the miners watch fights in their spare time. it's less pretentious than that theater they have on the surface.
thank you for your comforting words. it feels good even just to be able to talk about it.
my brother has always been my protector, and i've never contemplated stepping out of his shadow... yet even though we may take different paths, i am... still his little sister.
but misha can see clockie, too, right? they even grew up together, but misha hasn't started the way of the trailblaze yet...
before her sensei suddenly decided to leave, they insisted that i watch over her progress. part of the reason i've assigned kano nana to keep an eye on her is to fulfill my promise.
there's no need to be so formal. you helped us defeat that big fella, anyway. plus, if we keep speaking pleasantries, we'll waste a whole day.
um... though i am not a knight of favonius yet... may i still help in some capacity?
if you weren't here today, i wouldn't have been able to help bea.
no wonder aventurine's scrambling to partner up with someone -- the ipc can't back him up in the dreamscape.
when you're exhausted, everything becomes an uphill struggle. even trying to have fun -- you won't be able to enjoy yourself if you're too tired.
but don't worry, the traveler here is a seasoned warrior and will assure our safety.
...and we need to be able to observe the aurora... this is going to be difficult.
that's it, i've reset the energy system! let's go and operate the gear bridge terminal.
...thank you. i think i realize something now.
alright, you'll be safe here. my workshop has pretty good soundproofing, and barely anyone comes in.
when i first saw this planet, i thought: a world covered in ice... could it have something to do with my past? now i can't stop thinking about it.
music may have its creative secrets, but it's the emotions and resolve in the voice, not just the skill, that makes a song really move someone.
a real knight... how much longer until i become worthy of this title...?
sounds scary. i thought you said she was kind-hearted?
this gentleman was seeking help at the gates of mondstadt, which makes him a guest of the city.
the monsters committed many atrocities on inazuman soil. and the rifthounds were always their advance guard.
as a mark of my gratitude, i will answer any questions you may have about the road ahead or the events of the past.
i'm afraid that this is not something that just anyone can do. if i could do it, you would no longer call me an astrologist... but a visionary.
in which case... hmm... captain kaeya seems to be in the habit of fishing for information at angel's share.
let's head to the city, i think i'll try my luck with some people that i know.
truth be told, the meteor fragment isn't the only item that was stolen... but we want the museum to open as soon as possible. we can worry about the other missing items later.
i don't think i asked you what you thought of it at the time, though. what do you think? be honest.
sure enough... the watchmaker is the third nameless. even i could guess that one.
um, miss aratani, is there any way at all we can still get this printed?
oh! greetings to you too. i have a design here for a garment, would you be so kind as to take a look?
i didn't know there were so many great and mysterious beings in the universe... it goes to show just how tiny and fragile we really are.
yeah! alright, let's go! to the sleepless earl!
the man we ran into... he doesn't seem happy at all.
miss tingyun couldn't tear herself away from work, so we've had to gift this on her behalf today.
apart from its creator, i fear no one knows how to deactivate it.
it is true, i was offering all kinds of great benefits to the adventurers' guild because they are a new client.
you seem to know a lot, miss chevreuse. i assume you use these types of firearms on a regular basis?
if i didn't take this step, it's not like a meteor shower would just rain upon me, either.
he never looked back, and i never went to check on him or looked into his fate again.
no, not at all. it's an honor for me to have an opportunity to promote the sword arts. if anything, it's your dedication to the event that everyone will appreciate.
that's the one. actually, it's not a wish-granting incantation at all. it's a spell to help calm the ley line memories.
it looks like the sky here has changed somewhat.
no need for formalities. you probably know nothing about the luofu, the place you're heading to, correct? let us take this opportunity to discuss it.
i know this is hard, you don't have to be hard-pressed to make a decision. as i have said... the answer is inconsequential.
when you're free, let's go hit up the divination commission together and see what fu xuan has to say.
this time, i would like you to come with me to mondstadt to reclaim a box that belongs to my master.
i do so not without reservations, so... i hope that you will treat this matter as confidential.
my body has fully recovered, and the shogun's will no longer fights against me.
hmm? what is this stall doing here? maybe it's for participants who need a break?
dan heng and i are members of the astral express crew~
it's like i can feel... emotions contained within them. confusion... fear... sadness... and others so faint i can barely feel them...
if one carries a blade, it's bound to be used to cut something down. my reason for drawing my sword -- past, present, or future -- remains singular.
yoimiya was down there for quite a while. it was dark before we finally rode the aquabus back to the city. i figured she'd wanna sleep in today.
"snow that once adorned the world in silver, thaws to reveal the gleam of the fruit upon frost-laden branches." *sigh* how picturesque! only some tea would make this setting more complete.
me neither... i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
are you suggesting that... this is not how things should be?
ah, chiori! you sure have changed a lot. this is the first time we've seen you since you left inazuma.
mm... it did seem like he had a kind of... tunnel vision. and it sounded like he was holding himself to unreachable standards to attain his dreams.
*smiles* you forget, that man mentioned it before he left. my memory's not very good, but it's not so bad that i can't remember details from just minutes ago.
uh... why would he say that?
you want to explore somewhere else? uh, how about we finish the test of courage first!
i did kind of force it on you, after all. not to mention that i dragged you along with me and gave you all sorts of trouble along the way. hehe, i'd feel bad if i charged you any mora.
exactly! we're chasing down a legend, after all. what's true or not doesn't matter as much.
in any case, we must still be in a dream. it can't be anywhere else, much less reality... i'm never wrong about the distinctive sense of memoria that's in the air.
i was born into a humble family, and all the wealth you see now began with a single haul of fish.
everyone watching the exhibition match will be able to experience something new in a traditional form.
selfie, selfie... you're right. i've been here so many times. why didn't i think of taking a photo?
she's trying to say that all the commotion this causes is likely to be a great disturbance to the humans.
leaving already? ah, and i was looking forward to playing a few more rounds with you.
you know, it was difficult for me to believe you. some of the words you use are too alien for those that have lived their entire life in belobog.
as i explained, wangsheng funeral parlor was, once upon a time, more akin to a doctor's office than an actual funeral parlor.
hey, look at all these chips scattered everywhere...
aha! i see something here... it's a little vague but i think i can get his name... ah, yes! "leonard"!
me? i didn't do anything, seriously.
days of youth are fleeting, but those shining memories are gifts of growing up, and they deserve to be treasured forever.
or, in full: the "neighboring nations congenial poetry gala"!
...this is the end of the road for you.
no way. master yanqing has been great to me.
the fragmentum has a big influence on the space around it. all this electronic equipment on the station must short-circuit pretty regularly, huh?
mondstadt and i, maid noelle of the knights of favonius, will always welcome you when you return!
ah, so satisfied... who would have thought knowing you would bear so many benefits.
hee-hee, stop it hanshirou, you'll embarrass me!
i'll tell you why, this is why! this is the chance you've been waiting for, to talk everything through!
y'know, it's funny how the "rules" always seem to work in your favor, don't you think? this world's been hanging by a thread and now you're here to pull the plug on it!
hah, that guy. one of these days he's gonna get busted by my brother.
and that's assuming no other disasters occur. i care more about those in the present than a future i can't be sure of.
oh, well aren't you confident? let me give it a try then.
hehe, if it isn't the leader of watatsumi island, who looks as soft as a jellyfish, but whose words sting like one, too.
whenever that happened, my brother would hum a lullaby for me. halfway through the song, i would already be asleep...
this is the theophany that montana told us about. the only way to see slumbernana monkey is apparently through forming some kind of connection with the assistanana.
see, skott? looks like your bros have different ideas of what "family" means.
see if you can find a way to get the right things into the right places. usually it requires a bit of destruction, as well as elemental reactions. on your marks!
i've lost... if i can't even handle this kind of training, there's no way i'll beat skott...
in the end, only seven victors remained standing in teyvat. they built cities and nations on the corpses of the vanquished, and thus began the era of the seven.
tsk, trying to worm your way in again, huh? but you won't be able to establish a connection if you know nothing about slumbernana monkey~
ah! hold on... there are some letters here.
yes, no need to try and understand it. let me put this simply: right now, she is surrounded by chaos.
yes... sadly i was looking in the wrong place. but i did reap some rewards.
even if it's not fireworks-related, i'll happily oblige. customers come first, always.
well, i did, which is why...
and here we are! the best viewing spot in all of golden hour! look, there's even a telescope here! when the charmony festival arrives, remember to be here early if you wanna get a seat.
i'm not booked for any performances, and most visitors to penacony don't need tour guides anyway... they're all big shots who have their own entourage with them.
so dangerous... you're lucky to have lived till now.
*sigh* i feel like... even though long-life species get to live forever...
a most terrifying close call that was. but fear not! the darkest hour of the night may be upon us, but this majestic skyscraper shall now welcome the start of an epic hunt!
that's right, but don't worry, this isn't a trial. i just want to have a chat with you and get a better understanding of the facts.
enough dilly-dallying, we gotta go.
oh, i remember you mentioned something about strange dreams before...
it is because they're afraid to wake up from the dream.
so, what is your definition of living a happy life?
so it is norbert after all! and he's making his accomplice impersonate a silvermane guard! the audacity!
well, this dreamweaving method feels just like condensing six-phased ice! i can barely tell them apart!
you're here, then let's get straight to business.
ooh, so many stains... once the tables are clear, they'll need to be washed with a good detergent...
i will not forget this. i shall be sure to repay your kindness at an appropriate juncture.
ahem, yeah... but to go up against yunli is quite impressive, you know? that aura of heroism and grace. it almost makes me want to learn xianzhou swordplay!
the fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise... they would have been purged long ago.
for your protection, i feel strongly that one of our knights should escort you there.
just as i thought, this is yet another snare laid down by the evil ninja.
if you're here, you're our guest, so please enjoy this poetry fest!
if you hear any juicy gossi-- uh... information, come find me!
sheesh, why do you keep asking me that? we're in the middle of investigating a murder case for the family. may we speak to your captain about it?
...on the day of the real exam, if -- and i mean only if...
hehe, i already have an idea of the color and type of fireworks i wanna give you guys. i'll keep it a secret for now, though.
is that right? then i guess mister albedo must be an artist working with the yae publishing house.
however, there is only a small amount of space remaining in the book in question. your book is too big, so you have to reduce it to about half the size to make it fit.
i waited and waited, and kept wondering when pops was finally gonna take me there. eventually, people started coming home from the festival...
i have a question for you. i'd like to hear your honest opinion.
the path of the swordmaster is filled with twists and turns. it is no small undertaking to pursue the position of greatest swordmaster in the world.
...wake up from this dream and go to where you should be. your gamble... is not over yet.
but... my past isn't something i'm constantly thinking about. i have plenty of other dreams...
now, kamisato ayato and the yashiro commission are neutral parties, so i have no right to give orders to the shuumatsuban.
and what's more, there were plenty of suspects invited. do they really think... that a blade is more dangerous than that "black hole" you're wielding?
now i must take over the duties of the supreme guardian... and discard my naive fantasies.
that's because teyvat's stars can only display the fates and truths of "this world."
from the day i set foot on the battlefield, i knew that my blazing wings would eventually be extinguished. all i can hope is, before i return to the earth, i'll be able to see... the brightest light in the sky.
hang on a sec, isn't that wallace up ahead? looks like he's finally made some friends! i wonder what they're talking about...
somehow, having you by my side is... soothing...
compensation? they hit us!
miss marjorie... would you mind letting me help you find the missing monocle?
oh come on, you know that's what you want deep down inside. i can see it on your face.
you've managed to make a guy like him turn over a new leaf. you're amazing, mister tail!
ugh, so i'm a criminal, huh? forget sampo, wait until i get my hands on you!
but now i see that hers was a gaze full of delight and hope. it was not just a duty, but a joy, too. she loved humanity very dearly.
yes, that's definitely possible.
i only lost because i was duped by her little tricks.
just when i thought i could catch a break, things go haywire! guess my nice dress will have to wait for a while...
i've tried talking to her, but you know how she is... she uses her wit to talk circles around anyone...
hehe, allow me to formally introduce the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," urakusai.
if that's the case, where is the stellaron now?
hey, check it out. the bases of these stone lanterns are different...
failure doesn't mean weakness. only the strong can gather the will to resist the order and try to break free.
equally unforgettable, i'm sure. anyway, don't worry about the future -- live in the moment!
that said, a vision doesn't hurt to have as a little accessory. it is, after all, the one useful study tool that miserly old lady ever gave me, in a rare act of generosity.
let's get out of his line of sight and sneak up on him.
even if there's no audience yet, there should be some staff around. why is it so silent...?
this place is full of fancy little gadgets -- herta's collection. i really don't get why she'd go out of her way to collect them and then leave them here to gather dust...
...but what about the "furnace" his master mentioned?
am i? maybe it's because i had the other shrine maidens leave. anyway, i've always been like this.
i think we need a little private time. see you soon.
and... you'll come back and travel with us once this is all over, right?
the pleasure is all mine, "sole of the deep."
the color... the texture... yup, this is the stolen meteor fragment alright -- fantastic!
with some things, if you haven't grasped the essentials, all the hard work in the world can go to waste... know what i mean?
mister giovanni, i didn't expect to see you again so soon.
there's nothing more to say, gepard. the decision is yours.
yes. though they only represent a tiny proportion of the memories in the ley lines, it will still be quite a sight to behold when the time comes.
(well, i've got nothing better to do anyway. i'll do as she says and see what happens.)
*sigh* i knew it. things are never simple are they...
that's right. dreams themselves may be imaginary, but they're also experiences that can never be relived or replicated.
i hate to admit it, but i'm even starting to miss sampo... hold up! i must be losing my mind. nope -- i'll take the xianzhou over that blue-haired bore any day...
well, let's see... for example, "vera's melancholy," "heart of clear springs"...
sorry... i seem to be overreacting. outside the dreamscape, this is my first time seeing such a unique doll.
still in denial? your secret dealings have been photographed. we have all the evidence we need. is there anything else you want to say?
mister cyrus, our answer is windwheel aster!
what? but we've done a whole day's work -- what's the sun playing at? it felt like we spent the whole day in the palace of astrum.
there seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. to put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
is it me or is it... cold here?
i'll show you once we're back to the master control zone~
"it is believed that takuto developed this style of swordsmanship while dueling with kamai, who had also befriended the third-generation heir of the souran isshin art, tominaga masanari."
well said! oh, i almost forgot! seele had other matters today, and couldn't attend today's meeting. but she entrusted me to deliver a message, ahem...
this is... something from when i was a child.
oh, don't listen to the shogun. desserts! cavities are no big deal -- you can just replace your teeth. anyway, i just don't see how desserts can pose a serious obstacle to my pursuit of eternity.
good. why were those ipc workers threatening you?
to harmony, to the trailblaze, to the future of penacony and the universe, and to the generous alfalfa family head, mister oti alfalfa...
told you! that's what happens when you disrespect me!
gepard, can you lend your dear sister a hand? help me pack my bags~
hoolay, from the very moment you stepped into my mind, you had already lost.
...the day that i can fight side by side with you as a knight.
(that lady bonajade feels more like a... moneylender rather than the owner of a pawnshop.)
what if this decision is too much for one person? the impact of this choice could haunt bronya for the rest of her life.
knowing who i am and still showing such malice, you're not the first, nor will you be the last. this scene played out many times before -- and usually, when faced with my questions, most people retort "why can't i?"
*sigh* ...i'm tired of packing. let's leave it here for today. thanks for your help.
well, now we're two people short.
no kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
thank you for offering, klee, but that's not quite it!
hey, i'm just occasionally out of mora, that's all. i never said i was a pauper.
this food stall sells all kinds of inazuman specialties. anything you want to eat, it's my treat!
...gepard! way to make it obvious.
in the meantime, do you think you could head out and look for more clues? we can compare notes when you're done - i'm counting on you!
let's head over. oh, by the way...
could it be...? that never even occured to me... but i guess it's not impossible!
starting from mondstadt, to liyue, and then to inazuma... i will go see the sights you've seen and meet the people you've come across.
ninja gama, can you kindly enlighten us on the proceedings thus far?
come on, let's take the microfilm back to the museum.
...so, ask-me-for-directions arnold, let me ask you something!
oh, you misunderstand.
once you start remembering more things, you'll be able to find your friend again.
we're in a real competition, so please don't feel obliged to go easy on me.
clamor and commotion are strictly external, my inner being shall remain tranquil as ever.
when i first woke up after being rescued from the ice, i could see clusters of stars in front of me. i reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
the signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
the only heir of the famous wanmin restaurant, a good old friend of mine. there's no better choice!
readers will devour your content a lot more quickly than you'd think. if we don't keep delivering the goods now we've caught their attention, all our hard work so far is in vain.
it's eric, right? here, you can have this.
yes. anyway, it took many years, but eventually the plague was completely eradicated.
a shattered emptiness draped in the guise of desire... his existence is strikingly powerful, yet the self beneath is extraordinarily faint.
this is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: weighing your options and making a decision. there are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
who knows -- once you're reunited with your family, maybe you'll find inazuma the right kind of place to call home.
huh!? so it's you! you're the one who was threatening to take us out in the snow plains!
so the ei of the present planted the sacred sakura in the realm of consciousness, and it took root in the inazuma of the past...
so. what made you guys embark on your treacherous journey to inazuma?
hello, mister gallagher, sir. judging from your tone, it sounds like you were expecting us.
...if we ever meet again, please don't talk in riddles.
the variable is... our arrival! no outsider's set foot in the underground for over a decade...
the memokeeper may be able to teleport the bomb to a deserted location, but... i've found a note inside the doll.
one thing i do know about baizhu is that he's obsessed with the idea of immortality... but whether that has anything to do with what he's hiding is hard to say.
what a pity... i thought your "beginner's luck" would carry you a little further before it came to this. but alas. the time has come prematurely.
hello. none of you seem surprised by my arrival.
the good news is, persikov managed to figure out the location of the crystalline cores by piecing together the snippets of information he could get from the delirious soldiers...
*sigh* snow as far as the eye can see. which direction should we take?
hmm, i suppose the reason the head of the kamisato house never spoke of this to the family was due to similar safety concerns.
the discomfort i was experiencing earlier was caused by the shogun rejecting my continued use of her body.
there's no need to spend all that effort on me, i'm not in dire need of food...
what experience is this? it looks like the healer's market...
i simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. she's more fragile than i'd imagined.
it's going smoothly. thanks for making the trip to join the festival.
could you... please make an exception? we're not going to cause any trouble.
the teachers and students here sure are unique.
alright, alright. i just gave you a compliment, don't let it go to your head. however, you are indeed the hero this time.
...or he wasn't telling us the truth?
hey! that's not the spirit!
looking forward to your reply. yours, march seventh.
this is the most common hunting tactic used by borisin.
i agree. they're at least worth a try.
i'm sure this quest to uncover the truth behind an ancient story will turn into a most charming tale... do share it with me, won't you? i couldn't bear to miss out.
that's old hat, we're opening up new ground.
stop struggling, hoolay. there's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to the shackling prison.
ah, it's the antimatter legion! so these crazy jerks made it all the way here... watch this!
if it points us towards the watchmaker's legacy, it will be connected to everyone who is melded to penacony's dream...
really? you're gonna say yes just like that?
i think i'm mostly here for myself. still...
i heard the solwarm festival was first established to celebrate the arrival of spring, but belobog citizens these days just see it as a few days off... i want to bring the original meaning back again.
an "ambition" is a yearning for something material, or a concrete outcome. it is finite in nature, and will be replaced by a new ambition in due course.
wow, look at the carved ice! it feels perfect for this city, somehow.
you're the one who's embarked on epic journeys to distant places and achieved many great feats.
until our next meeting. may my songs gift you with pleasant dreams.
i almost lost my cool when he went for his flask...
many things have changed. lots of outlanders have come to inazuma, and lots of inazumans have gone out as well.
please come with me. i hope you won't be distracted by some invisible friend again...
it's alright, you're safe now. we'll bring you back.
we were also planning on having a victory feast once we're all finished filming. you can join us, right?
i feel more competent now than ever before. i even have the time outside my work for the yashiro commission to try some new things. would you like to try one of my home-made snacks? i just learned how to make them recently.
i'm not sure how much weight my opinion carries, but that's my take on the matter.
fireworks are for now, but friends are forever.
one day, this rage will ignite and burn me alive. i will become the very monster that the reignbow lux arrow hunts...
regardless of how alluring their promises may be, this contract is nothing more than a gamble. as leader, i cannot let the future of belobog hinge on a roll of the dice.
well, the healer lady couldn't do anything about my condition. she just told me to "enjoy some tasty food."
look how happy they are! it's clear they trust you a lot.
no matter how powerful the great mujina youkai might be, it's no match for my specially made fireworks! just light 'em up and you'll scare it off, no problem.
i can see why you'd suggest that. you're thinking i could use my knowledge of how mora works to my advantage and make a lot of money there.
oh! well, thanks for remembering my name then.
i'm seriously scared they might start moving... let's just leave, please!
i'm just saying! it'll be a shame if they get smashed to pieces.
yes. with some exceptions, but that is more or less correct.
traveler, what a pleasant surprise.
you're not seriously thinking of taking him to bubu pharmacy in this state, are you?
nobody did, but it never hurts to be prepared!
you're not wrong... but if i give up so easily, then the next time someone needs help, i'll mess up again...
i thought that the relaxed atmosphere there would suit our day much better than the prohibitively formal one of a high-end restaurant.
only some who have gone under their shadow can go farther, tainting themselves with more nihility... that's all.
alright! enough playing. it's time to visit my masters.
wouldn't i be taking up your time, though? i doubt this was in your schedule...
it's difficult. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
well, right now, i'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
well, guess i'll keep it then!
well... would you believe me if i said yes?
i never knew pela had a strict side...
and now, i have finally seized the chance to collaborate! it took me much trekking across the land to petition yujing terrace and contact the knights of favonius, but eventually...
i... want to see the stellaron. i want to see the place where cocolia sacrificed herself.
there are three thermic cores -- you'll need them to solve the puzzles in the victory zone. let's see what you've got!
interesting. i suppose it's worth using my astrology on.
i ran into a wizened lady there. she was at the dock waiting for her long-departed lover to return, waiting for countless hours within time that stood still.
a few days ago, i was sorting through some old family belongings when i found a notebook that belonged to my mother.
now that we've dealt with the rifthounds, this matter is halfway resolved. it does not appear that the threat will escalate for the time being.
alright, alright, we got it. mister limestein, is there something you want to discuss with us?
you hear that? in case it was too subtle for you -- thoma's complaining that you guys never make time to come and visit your old pals.
but according to my grandpa, the pharmacist they met had a very ominous aura about him...
i don't see the shopkeeper. let's look for her in the area.
look! that's the statue of clockie, penacony's famous cartoon character!
we should also be glad that miss topaz is the one in charge of the jarilo-vi project. if it were someone else from the strategic investment department, things might have gotten... complicated.
it's a family tradition. all our regular customers know about this.
but, since we're here, i still think we should go inside and explore in full.
that belobog expedition got in your head, huh...
...from the kind of weapons made here, i should be able to learn something about the local combat style. will you come with me to the blacksmith, so i can take a look?
and would the stars really want their caller to have such a heartless soul?
clara, it's dangerous here! find somewhere to hide!
i also know that you guys often travel around different places in the cosmos. did the family invite you here? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
i didn't expect to see you here. didn't you say you were really busy?
hello, good evening! i'm robin, a singer from the family. no need for formalities, this is just a friendly off-stage chat. can you spare me a moment?
...but i'm curious, why pick aurum alley of all places? it's packed with tourists around, and it'd be bad if someone got hurt.
wait, you managed to choose the right door on your first try?
to be of help to you, sir, and to the millelith... it is my great honor.
he knows how to keep his identity hidden, and his sources are fast and reliable... i guess he found out about mister norbert's arrest and made a run for it.
hehe, start thinking, we're going to need all the humor we can get... at least the biggest hurdle is behind us.
uh... you might have found the wrong person.
come on, let's go to the restricted zone. if we can get ahead of the curve and find the stellaron, cocolia will be out of options.
it's no big deal. more importantly -- is there a reason why you were looking for a knight of favonius? may i be of any assistance?
no, pops. i meant the materials. the materials that we ordered. they should have arrived today.
don't... please don't praise me like that! ...we should talk about what we came here to do: finding inspiration.
...despicable. my "criminal activity" senses are tingling.
even i, my mother's own daughter, had never even heard of this friend before. it just seems so mysterious. so i think it must be someone with transcendent abilities who doesn't show themselves very often.
her strength belies her appearance, but even so...
ah, little sayu. she hasn't been causing you any trouble lately, has she? hehe, if you ever notice her slacking off, please let me know.
then come aboard and take a look for yourself.
it is precisely because of their helplessness, because their visions have been taken from them, that their will is all the more precious.
well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young asta. and turning a blind eye is not the way of the nameless.
the surroundings are different from before. the stage decorations... look a bit tidier now?
what's your problem! why are you blocking our way!?
let's not wait any longer and ask them to bring out the food.
you mustn't open the package until after you leave the shrine. otherwise... you will be cursed with bad luck.
at first, i didn't dare to open my mouth. but once i couldn't hold my breath any longer, i decided to take a big breath in. hehe, turns out the water wasn't as salty as i imagined... it didn't really taste like anything at all!
there aren't many fiendlings left. this is cause for us to rejoice!
but the fireworks...
that lacks a sense of propriety! i'm not just writing a letter. i'm writing a handwritten letter! i've gotta show them i'm really on the xianzhou!
the reports look pretty normal today. you can go have some rest.
this is an opportunity for you to show remorse.
from the moment i walked in, i made it clear that the questions i'd ask might not reflect my actual thoughts.
the paper looks familiar... can i open it?
i didn't hear anything about rent, and i helped out, too...
what even...! the profnana was just encouraging freedom in the classroom, and you're not even making the slightest effort in your class!
mister blacksmith, do you remember seeing a child in a wheelchair?
we're back here again. aventurine actually chose a really conspicuous location...
i have chosen the latter because... if stubbornly isolating herself in the plane of euthymia is her idea of eternity...
success! another mechanism shut down.
it just goes to show, you have to have an interesting character sitting in the back row by the window.
the express crew tread upon the trailblaze. we travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
yes, if the tenryou commission truly is as busy with preparations as thoma claims, then some rest would be a welcome change of pace.
they made me realize that while we remain focused on "preserving" the ground beneath our feet, we should not forget to look up into the sky.
the secrets of history shine through in the relics that survive, and this one now has the story of another age to tell.
...never mind. i'm fine with silence.
so enjoy your life while you can, and when your duty to the living is over, you can meet whoever you want again in the afterlife. isn't that great?
there should be a hilichurl camp nearby. let's place the baron bunny there and try it out.
when i first met her i thought she was kinda scary, but now it seems like there's something on her mind. i'm too nervous to ask her.
seriously, think about it, it's aether copying! i've only ever heard of that stellaron hunter girl using this kind of tech.
we can find some other way to help sakujirou, there's no need to make things difficult for you. this sounds like something for sakujirou and keisuke to resolve between themselves.
i can't see anything fishy... did kafka lay a trap for us? let's get diting to investigate.
shortly after we parted ways, i wandered into a ball without realizing it. a lady wearing a black veil invited me to dance. it was my first dance, and it was an unforgettable experience.
do you not know how to wield a blade...? or do you simply doubt your abilities on account of your advanced age and declining physical condition?
...time to head back to the goethe hotel for a good night's sleep!
huh? what in the... is that my voice!?
...i understand. but before replying, we must first discuss this among ourselves.
be it simple price negotiation or a full-blown trade war, momentum and bargaining chips are but minor factors. to win, you need to be first to find out what cards your opponent is holding.
ohh... okay! sorry, mister cyrus, maybe next time!
i've been reminded of many people, too. kitsune saiguu, makoto, and all the other friends who i watched pass even further back.
it's fine. don't worry.
ugh, i hardly see what all the fuss is about. everyone seemed perfectly happy to me.
hmm... how about some stir-fried filet with a side of crab roe tofu?
scrap metal, huh?... the key to victory is never the weapon. it's the person wielding it!
history fictionologist? so what everything you told us was made up?
oh, for me? you have my thanks. it seems that i have made things difficult for you, considering that you were supposed to be my guests.
katou whatever-your-name-was, given the circumstances, why don't you start by going to find your brother and also picking up a handful of salt on your way. we'll need to use it during the exorcism.
it appears to be guarding the dango milk here...
why don't we look around here first? i've been wanting to see the "zubayr theater," anyway.
wait! don't tell me -- is it our latest promotion? i'm touched that you journeyed all this way...
what do you think? does the astral express look the same as you imagined?
and what brings you here on this finest of days? not business, i presume? so what is it? need my help?
cooking, helping with the family business, exorcising evil spirits, or conquering demons...
really? so my guess was correct.
in other words... do you want to try my home-made matcha?
that is why i must meet that successor. with our knowledge combined, i might be able to gain new insight into your fate.
all i mean is, if you want to get your work printed now, there is only one way: you have to combine it with another print.
there's always coffee if i feel sleepy, and i have some candy on hand just in case i ever feel low on energy...
my apologies, i have a lot of business to attend to at present -- i won't be joining you. good luck recovering the stolen items.
excellent. ah, i'm looking forward to the next round... i'll await your good news~
ei, you're thinking about this all so conscientiously. i've only got as far as wondering whether i'll be able to sell entrance tickets to the grand narukami shrine in the future.
she said it's coffee -- an astral express specialty. i tried a sip, but it's a little...
it appears the good sir has seen many great events, and it's true that an uninvited guest has unexpectedly entered the dreamscape.
so... what's the verdict? what do the people think?
um... why don't i cook tonight? you can take a break...
is that also part of the script?
look at thoma from the yashiro commission. he's originally from mondstadt, but everyone thinks he's a top-tier guy!
i--it's probably because i'm in a completely different environment. i don't know how i should act to make sure i don't make a fool of myself...
thanks so much! we'll be waiting -- patiently.
oh, i see. that'll be the fishing boats coming back from the open ocean. how much cargo were they carrying? remember, i taught you how you can tell.
look, diting found a strange chest... and there's a hand print on it...!
i hope that one day the children of belobog will have the same opportunity to witness the stars up close.
huh? there's a note here too. "take your fancy? there's a reward inside~"
this time around, there were no successful bids for him.
like me, that successor must also be one who has surpassed their teacher. i must not be careless.
i really enjoyed myself too! i never knew liyue's couplet poetry was so much fun.
in any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
all right. it looks like there are other guests who are also confused. i'll have to excuse myself -- please enjoy the dreamscape.
regarding this adventurer... i do believe i have read about him. he even made his mark on dragonspine. yes, it must be him... hmm... oh, what was his name...?
if it were up to me... i'd probably agree to the ipc's conditions.
sure. there's no harm in changing my schedule around once in a while.
besides... i'm still not skilled enough. any free time that i get should be spent training.
whoa, check this place out! tables and sentry posts -- there must have been silvermane guards stationed here once.
like, "let me send over 'tarou the goldfish,' the most trusty fish in my aquarium, to accompany you!"
the original plan was for ei to simply discard it. but perhaps ei thought this to be too cruel, because in the end she chose only to seal the power within it.
...after all these years, i never thought i'd set eyes on this guitar again. *sigh* guess we're stuck with each other...
now that you've accomplished your goal, i think you can be a little more forthcoming.
*sigh* you know, i quite understand such sentiments...
denisovan... four hundred twenty-six?
hey, nice to meet you. i'm himeko, navigator of the astral express.
maybe her mirage conceals some secrets that she doesn't want anyone to know about.
fascinating. i'm learning a lot today. let's get this underway.
...but pom-pom said the banquet we were invited to is still a little ways off. hmm... what can i do to pass the time...?
had i made all enemies of eternity stand against you, you still would not have wavered.
...this is a difficult matter. if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
i hesitate to call it a solution, but i might have some information that might help.
straight to the point, i see. works for me.
but inside a realm of consciousness, i exist independently of her. she cannot affect me in this way.
come to think of it, whenever i see you in mondstadt, you do always seem to be in a hurry...
why don't we keep up the momentum from our respective first-round victories? let's give our fungi some special training to strengthen our bonds with them.
tianquan ningguang... well-off, a radiant gaze, exquisite face, in the know and capable of anything!
huh? really? i just wanted to say something...
tell me this. why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? why now?
i advanced all the way to the semifinals.
don't get the wrong person, though, or all our efforts will have been for nothing.
ahem! s--seeing as our hosts are so thoughtful, i guess we should help ourselves. right, mister yang?
you see, paimon, in the past, when printing was not yet well-developed, handwritten text could easily become smudged in books when exposed to moisture.
how about it? if you're real legitimate businessmen, there's nothing to fear, is there?
that's right, flowers for princess fischl. have you read this book before, klee?
helping those in need, befriending those worth counting on, and saving the world a few times along the way...
hehe. i had to. i wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
oh, sorry if we were a little loud. it's always the way, though -- it's like that every time i need to ask pops something.
a jade ring? can't say i have.
you are unduly concerned. i'm simply conserving my energy.
hello! i'm hu tao, director of the wangsheng funeral parlor.
seems like the smoke is getting thinner...
can this be used for mixing drinks? oh, and there's a note underneath... "exchange with your precious things."
uhh, you wait here. i'm gonna get your comrades to help you.
let's call it a day, shall we? and since we're in belobog, it means another night at the goethe hotel!
*sigh* alright then, give me a moment to mentally prepare myself.
*sigh* alright... well, keeping you around under duress would only take all the fun out of it.
if what mister norbert said is true, then our safest option is to send a civilian to try to reach out to mister cold feet and lure him out of his lair.
time is very valuable to me. so when i first came up with the idea, i made a rule that my time would go to the highest bidder.
then my duty as her eternal familiar is to drag her back out of her own head and into the real world.
the remains of the swarm author?
i'm really worried about the future of penacony...
it was just a small favor, really. nothing to get overexcited about.
...do you think anyone's gonna know what you're talking about?
...so you guessed it already.
oh, you beat me to it. looks like your brain is intact.
clara, you said it yourself before, right? svarog's duty is to protect the underworld and preserve the civilization here. we have the same wish. why would he refuse to cooperate with us?
so... could the author not simply add a narrative device whereby the main character could accept the feelings of all seven admirers at once? yes, that would solve it!
i like fireworks because creating incredible fireworks makes me feel so proud of my work.
gear bridge control terminal -- ha, still found it!
since the physical body will eventually turn to dust, she replaced hers with that of a puppet.
but don't keep your fungus waiting much longer... look, now that it's no longer under the wisdom orb's control, it's waiting for your orders.
the most important skill for sorting out a mess is being tough and ruthless. don't be deceived by her ethereal appearance... she has what it takes to put the luofu's alchemy commission back in order.
a desire to dream, to slumber and escape reality... all those hidden emotions have given birth to the sweet dream of the order.
...back to the investigation. we contacted an agent from wildfire -- apparently she has some first-hand intel.
hahaha, well, i'm glad you agree! feel free to keep the compliments coming.
well then. the door is open. hop on in.
i won't step on that stage and sing, no matter who the traitor is or what orders they give me. i won't let the charmony festival become an event that destroys harmony itself...
lastly, there's that craftsman wearing artisanship commission clothing. he's unusually focused on checking that device.
we can always change our minds if we have a better idea. one must be careful not to act too hastily when taking an exam.
i'll keep my eyes open in case anything crops up. if so, i'll be sure to let you know.
alright, alright, i get it. you won over the big bad director with your superstar aura. you don't have to show off.
by the way, yanqing, where are we headed next?
i may not know much about this sort of thing, but at the very least i should try to learn something about it...
this is a human society -- at the moment, anyway -- and i'm just doing as i please.
i once told myself that i would never speak of these events again. facing the fact that she is gone is unbearably painful.
yes. for the longest time, i couldn't bring myself to face the pain of that loss.
this has certainly been a memorable series of events.
why do i get the sense that you spotted them right away... but you're planning to use it for your own ends?
so, it's not that the watchmaker's dream bubble is empty, but rather... the stuff inside ran away?
oh! pyro slimes... perfect, they can provide us with another ingredient we need.
however, if i'm wearing the same clothes as a fictional character, then it shouldn't be too big of an issue. the detective in the novel is known for being mischievous and doing things her own way.
but if you were to choose the more trustworthy person between myself and keqing...
right now, i don't have any plan to become an adventurer... i'm sorry...
i don't care who you are -- disappear right now and let me pass. and don't you ever pretend to be one of my friends again.
...well, it'll take a while to tell.
a new card back appeared on the market recently. it's extremely rare, and bears an image of a treasure chest.
it's up to you guys to protect your homes, your crops, and your folks!
by the way, there's really no point in trying to hide the way you feel.
what happens next is going to blow your mind...
hmph, do you even know who you're talking to? if your boss knows to treat us with respect, you'd better start showing some yourself!
so as long as we help her rediscover that same feeling she once had, her "aranara" will return naturally.
they were exactly like fireworks!
oh, come on, you only think it's rare because you never used to listen to a word i say.
don't get yourself all worked up. if jarilo-vi is strong enough to withstand a stellaron, it'll be just fine.
gradually, it developed into a lucrative business.
it seems that guuji yae was right. they have been fomenting unrest behind the scenes.
as for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? if the ipc tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!
are you concerned about your past? you seem like someone who prefers to look forward rather than back... or maybe i'm just describing myself.
please... begin. i am ready.
is it? i just want them to try it. it would be a shame for them to miss out on dango milk.
now do your best to relax. i will examine you.
are you okay, dan heng? march brought you up to speed, i assume?
i'm sure jarilo-vi won't be the only planet to have ipc visitors, but i bet not all of them will have a visitor like topaz...
...how is that gonna improve our chances?
no magic here. just a trick or two i learned from serval.
it doesn't bother me. i just hope she didn't make you feel too awkward...
is that... mister giovanni?
or perhaps the ley lines did not have the power to sustain him for very long. as was the case with the memory we saw earlier.
since the theme of the day is a change of pace, you can just call me ei. i'm not a great fan of rigid titles.
i see. yes, this is an important relationship, so he must choose wisely, but the decision-making process is a source of agony and conflict.
what about your integrity, huh? you brought the other kids out here to rivet town, didn't you?
the meteors we summoned flew up from the ground...
eh, i was kidding, and get your own opinion!
however, it concerns me that those forged orders went as far as they did, it's my responsibility to look into such matters. i will take the appropriate measures to resolve this.
find somewhere to hide -- quick -- i'll handle him!
i've been busy preparing for my exam. other than for work and training, i've barely left the library.
because one of the lines said... i'll experience "death" three times in the land of the dreams.
the first tenryou commissioner demonstrated his will with the blade in his hand. that is why the title has been passed down within the kujou clan ever since.
to me, hiding is much easier than being honest... yet, i still want to try expressing my emotions as any ordinary person would...
energy restored... system online... certification enabled... come on, come on!
why did you think i was from fontaine, though? is that because "megistus" doesn't sound much like a mondstadter surname?
after that... i will abolish the sakoku decree.
penacony is throwing a banquet -- i've received an invitation from the family.
now, what kind of wish do we think it would take to summon forth the author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits"? anyone?
from this angle... i can see a brilliant river of stars. it's mesmerizing...
at first, she didn't really want to say anything to me at all -- she just gave me yes and no answers.
oh, so we're all here with time to spare. what a treat!
(let's try that direction first. on paper, that area looks the perfect place for bad guys to do bad things.)
i'd be delighted. what would you like to talk about...?
i know, right? it's a dream that's loving and forgiving to everyone, just like the family.
i'm glad. the answer itself doesn't matter. what matters is that you've made a decision.
don't worry, i'm sure she has a reason for wanting some space to herself at the moment. we should just be open and understanding with her.
still, it looks like i won't be free from this court archmage role anytime soon...
back here again...
i'd be embarrassed too, getting stared at like that.
this purple ninja secret brew seems like it would replenish my ninja power. shatter it and replenish some ninja power.
ms. yun, i've already heard something about the reason for your involvement. you are looking for a venue for your new opera, aren't you?
i, bronya rand, the nineteenth guardian of belobog, hereby take my oath...
after all, i must be ready for battle at any moment if i am to protect everyone.
and then he runs to the dock and picks up some luggage?
don't worry, mister morris! accidents and last-minute challenges happen all the time. there's no need to blame yourself over it.
while there aren't any people in this mansion... they've set up quite a few memetic guards to patrol this place.
are you bored, welt? i understand... but we have lots of opportunities ahead of us. let's leave the memories of this expedition for them~
why would i be? i dreamed about helpful, friendly, cute aranara...
i didn't expect the first lesson to be so intense...
the boat is a-ready and waiting. i'll mark the location for you on the map. before you leave, i recommend that you pack some food and water. you can never be too prepared.
it's a long story...
there's something ominous about it... the water, i mean.
*sigh* now you see why i believe that ordinary folks should be kept in the dark...
its great weight meant that it hit osial with incredible force, while the energy within triggered that spectacular explosion.
hey, don't take everything so seriously.
there's clearly no one around, but there's a shadow on the ground. oh, this is like a real kaidan story!
could you join me over there for a minute? um... i need your help with something.
is that a hint for us to prepare a surprise for you, too? very clever...
she's the big shot! definitely got that "queen of the castle" vibe going on. aww, so cool.
huh, so everyone saw the same thing? i remember... it was a room, and then through a mirror, i came to a long hallway...
the strange thing is that they turned to meteors all of a sudden, and fell from the sky... why this happened i am not yet sure. i need some time.
that's why geniuses are interested in that field. science is all about uncovering the unknown...
but eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, ei.
given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the crew will naturally accept. however, if the ipc has any reservations...
since you invited me and all... sure.
if we keep going, we'll reach glaux avenue, which is the road to golden hour.
that's true. it's green from all the overgrowth on it.
still, it's got the same stony expression, haha.
he certainly has a beautiful tail. although... mine's a little softer.
then the situation is not as complicated as you seem to have made it. after all, i am the one who appoints the tenryou commissioner. the process is quite simple: anyone who can beat me in a duel becomes the new commissioner.
wow, matsuzaka, nice work! it's not easy to beat itto...
according to oleg, he's a robot that took part in the war of defense over seven hundred years ago. he possesses a near-human intelligence, and rules over all the machinery in the underground...
or, if you ever think about me during your journey, take it out, won't you? who knows, maybe i'll just end up appearing right in front of you.
oh, i'm sorry... mister cyrus, what were you saying just now? i was a little lost in my own thoughts...
alright, i won't tease the two of you any further.
you used it to store your things!? t--then where are the original contents of the box? that's what i want.
what food i like? hmm... off the top of my head, i don't really have an answer.
the results were terrifying. i advised him to give up adventuring as soon as possible, otherwise he could meet his end within the next two years.
i'd better not mess with the divination commission anymore.
how can you call yourself a supreme guardian if you can't overcome a cup of coffee? ugh, it's so bitter...
not bad at all. i'm glad you finally got to reveal the tricks you've been keeping up your sleeve.
and of course, our consultant, who's been helping out at the parlor every now and then.
go ahead and take a seat. there's something i need to take care of, but i'll be back momentarily.
i remember i'd be there when mother and the rest of them would convene, and serval would always patiently answer any questions i had... *sigh* i'm starting to feel like that was a long, long time ago.
i guess you could consider me someone who has often witnessed "fate." so far as i have seen, it cannot be swayed.
both the taste and the consistency are different, but the warm and soothing sense it brings me as i drink it... that feels the same.
i'm not sure we can give him the answer he would hope for.
hmph, rejecting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. it's their loss.
stick my neck out and get my head chopped off, you mean!
as the one who brought everyone together, it goes without saying that i'm the one most deserving of praise!
whenever i try to delve deeper into the meaning behind the words of a poem, i gain a better understanding of the author's state of mind.
thanks, clara. your thoughts mean a lot to us.
by inspiration walk, we simply mean wandering around in the wild, taking in the scenery, and pocketing any poetic thoughts.
good. so the crisis has been safely averted. when you visit the jade chamber in the future, you will be afforded generous treatment.
when i was designing it, i wanted it not only to be a fun game, but also capture liyue's culture in a unique way.
nah, i think the elevator's broken. i pressed all the buttons but nothing happened.
...oh, looks like we have two dan hengs on our team now.
i can promise you it won't be a boring job!
because other than me, there's only one person left.
you're one to talk! if this sister hadn't grabbed you in time, then you'd have been seriously hurt, if not dead!
cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, but the ninja belief in exorcising evil will never change.
not only did it scribble all over iwao's homework and get him in trouble at school, it also stole saika's snacks and broke matsuzaka's toys.
that's a really practical way of looking at it...
phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality...
when i'm with you... time seems to slow down and speed up at the same time.
the thunderstorm is getting out of control? this is the first i've heard of it.
but this raises more questions. according to misha, he was clearly born on an oceanic planet and led an ordinary life, with no connection to penacony at all...
not yet -- don't forget the elite player that mister giovanni mentioned.
easier said than done... do you know how?
their path of happiness should be forged by themselves. while i may not be a nameless, i'm willing to instill courage in all those who need it.
explore the unknown world to continue our journey ahead.
hmm, what should it be? how about a xianzhou souvenir?
here's my little partner in crime. souka named it "blitzara" -- i think it's rather good. very distinctive.
we didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
i'm just worried that if we don't get down to business soon, i'll take up too much of your time.
still, that hasn't stopped panic from building... people are confused -- they don't know where these strangers in black came from, nor what their intentions are.
there seems to be something on the back of this chair. let me have a closer look...
do you mean... you saw a cartoon character that doesn't exist in real life?
march, dan heng, you've been through a lot.
well, as far as instructions go, i guess that's simple enough...
as time went on, new exhibits were continually added to the memorial until it became the museum we see today.
but in this supposed "bliss", people won't have defeated their demons. the chance to overcome their tribulations would be forever lost to them. in other words... it is an escape.
the stores have changed, and so have the vendors... well, that's to be expected.
an academic conference... you mean we'll have to sit in an auditorium and spend several system hours talking about a few hundred slides' worth of scholarly discourse?
so much snow... even in the northern mountains, it wasn't like this.
anyway. this may add to the debt of gratitude i owe you, but the fact is, your arrival here has rescued what was fast becoming a rather dire situation indeed.
um, i notice that you're not wearing the space station staff uniform. do you really work here?
let's stay alert and make sure those monsters don't spot us.
anyway, don't worry, we're not going to bother you about it. we'll keep trying to buy you as much time as possible until you reach your final decision.
you two should be careful, though. without the same connections, you can't afford to be as reckless as me, hee-hee.
alright, but there are doors all over the place... which one should we choose...? do you have any idea, misha?
master kucha, i have placed the dazzling ninja seal all over the ninja capital.
breakfast also isn't usually so lavish. hence my surprise when we got here.
at least our journey together in penacony was real enough, and his loyalty and love for this land... must have been real too, right?
hmm... maybe he dyed his hair!
"a thesis on chivalry"... "favonius bladework fundamentals"... *sigh*
...i don't think she knows. the selection of the successor is done with utmost secrecy, and the child chosen must completely say goodbye to their past.
there's no tale more befitting the title of "a legend that never ends" than our fates as human beings.
soaking in the steaming water is a fine way to cleanse and soothe both your mind and body.
qingxin slime condensate... bleugh... surely this is xiangling getting payback...
whew... great. i was a little worried that my nerves would get the better of me. what about you, chevreuse?
no... no need for apologies.
back in mondstadt, i have previously provided chopsticks to visitors from liyue, but i have never used them myself... ohh, i hope i won't become a laughing stock...
there might be spare stove parts in the ruin. lemme see...
as a last resort, persikov went out on his own to look for the cores. but he was just a sickly researcher unfit for the task. he had to give up.
the people's sacrifice has always caused me immense pain, but in dwelling on the tragedy, i overlooked their splendor... the grief blinded me to how brightly they shone in their final moments.
i heard the xianzhou can tell your fortune -- is that how they do it? anyone can count on their fingers...
after all, you saw makoto in there, didn't you?
but now, the youkai memories that leak from the ley lines are weak. they are no longer able to fly.
the title of "the daughter of the kamisato clan" and involvement in the yashiro commission pales in comparison to the depths of your experiences.
my instincts are telling me something's not right with this guy, but...
alright, let's go. don't worry, now, i'll be coming along too.
what matters is that i made a brief and inconsequential visit, and your first reaction was to immediately arrange a sizable surveillance operation with myself as the target.
the ocean of stars is vast, and given our destinations, i'm afraid our paths may not cross again.
miss jade? greetings. the opening ceremony for the charmony festival has been moved to the radiant feldspar, so i'm here making some preparations.
in some of my tournament matches, i could see my opponent's hands shaking, hesitant to play their cards. now that i think about it, perhaps they were scared of what would happen if they defeated me...
seems like it, but "jade abacus" does sound a lot better.
i can't decipher his intentions right now... but based solely on the question, i would probably choose to build that dove a cage...
even if we're late, a grand theater like this shouldn't be completely empty.
huh? where'd the sound go!?
well... maybe it's better not to mention it... haha.
penacony's golden hour is pretty amazing, isn't it?
indeed. welt, do you know what to do?
this is belobog's history and culture museum -- built more than six hundred years ago.
sorry... i'll be sure to make it up to you.
wow! so this is what it's like from the spectator seats?
hm? if i'm not mistaken, there's someone knocking at the door.
alright children, no running around, okay? let's gather over here...
it's a... warp trotter?
how did you and venti really meet?
eternity is a concept intimately connected with time. when you begin to touch on eternity, the concept of time becomes murky.
oh, cool! then let's start with sakujirou's boat. we can chat along the way!
the two nameless have been honest in their answers. even though there are some tricky details, my intuition tells me there is nothing wrong.
diting can convey a lot of information with only a few sounds.
and you likely wouldn't be willing to buy them, either.
relax, i've got dan heng here with me.
...hey, you're taking his side already!?
ah yes, i remember the invitation. i need to make sure i'm well-prepared for this.
ah, uh, i mean... *cough* i never knew that my disciple was this skilled. as your master, i am most comforted.
that means you also have a good head on your shoulders and the ability to learn rapidly.
thanks, franz. i'll put in a good word for you with my brother and get him to promote you!
it is, isn't it? who can say whether it's coincidence or destiny.
that's exactly the point. trespassers end up running scared.
bright eyed and bushy tailed, with fortune swinging your way, no doubt. you should follow your heart today, and fate might just reward you for it.
so that means pom-pom is just... pom-pom? fascinating.
brrr. it really is one big snowball.
are you talking about us this time?
in your opinion, what does this "deja vu" mean?
...i'm just speculating. in any case, we have to be careful when handling aventurine. he's skilled at reading people and discerning the right moment to strike. also...
watching sucrose work on an experiment when she's in the zone blew me away! such focus and determination...
all my martial might was in vain... though i could conquer tatarigami and vanquish monsters, i was helpless against the ravages of time, powerless to keep the ones i cherished alive.
you're right... you're right, self-pity doesn't help solve anything.
well, does anyone know the exact location of where we're headed? or should i do a reading on my scryglass?
...i still feel that mister mikhail must have really wanted to witness this day himself.
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "be decisive, lest we be overwhelmed by the consequences." there are still fiendlings roaming nearby. let us be on our way.
a long time ago, the naganoharas were inspired to create new fireworks after watching such a meteor shower.
hardly the worst thing in the world, of course. but it has caused obstacles for me in the past.
and miss firefly, we thank you for all your support. we're faced with a formidable enemy. as long as the astral express and stellaron hunters' objectives are aligned, we're willing to cooperate with you.
if you're not too tired, gepard, can i talk to you for a moment?
finally, we have a lead to go on. thank you, glory!
congratulations, you won! come on now, let's hear your victory speech.
well, you were the ones who seemed concerned about his situation. don't you think it would be a little unfair to make me do all the work?
no, please, i... it was nothing, i was simply doing my duty.
as for thanking me, you'd be better off thanking master masakatsu. he's the one that gave me the fake visions in the first place.
ah, this show is a bit too literary for my taste, but the battle part is quite easy to understand... anyway, we've arrived at the exit. let's go!
i know what you mean. i don't like the feeling that i'm not in control. and now...
oh no, not yet! there's more mora to be made.
please, sit. have a taste of the jade chamber chef's cooking. this kind of food tastes far less satisfying if left out for too long.
i mean, these are all abstract topics that evoke a... sense of admiration that's hard to put into words.
hehe, any other details to share? we've heard that shingo has been behaving rather out of character since then.
why...? what's wrong with the family?
and then they'll immediately start arguing with each other in their completely incomprehensible language... eek.
with toys everywhere! they'd be flashing, moving, and spinning. also, tasty snacks for whenever i'm hungry!
it appears we can't climb the stairs in our current state...
inazuma is home to the yae publishing house, and a lot of people who like to write stories, too. in fact, most of what they write is based off of the kinds of fairy tales i was just talking about.
i'm the one who should be apologizing! sorry, let me explain.
fiendling chief, there's nowhere left to run. it's time to face your punishment delivered by my dazzling ninjutsu!
huh, it's about time. let's go! let's take them to "the place where all begins and all goes to rest"!
...i could tell that although neither of us acknowledged it, we both knew that the road ahead would likely end in tragedy.
aw, the aranara sure have a flair for magical journeys.
they're getting ready to attack! those miners are unarmed.
thank you. you too, of course... you've done a lot here.
and these minor issues warranted the secluded location and the hiring of ronin and kairagi to keep guard?
preparation is important, but the ceremony is fundamentally about sharing the great one's harmony with everyone. if there's a chance to sing with everyone, i will not refuse.
perhaps someone you've met or something you've experienced here. or perhaps you enjoy the atmosphere of liyue and you will become accustomed to it.
i just saw a group of people come down, and they were all wearing the same outfit. is that the akademiya's uniform?
i've watched furuyama brew tea on many occasions... i doubt i should have any major problems doing it myself.
come with me, my trusty assistants. i'm going to need your help.
i will continue to help everyone with their problems!
this grand festival is drawing to its close. this is the starting point for the ultimate stage of our journey... just as it marked the beginning of all the stories in penacony.
those who strive for perfection are to be commended.
this time, the gloves are off!
hmm, although it'll cost a lot of mora to get it printed. let me see if i've got enough saved up...
i don't think we have to be too self-conscious, but it's still something to keep in mind.
hmm, yes. this is a change in the person himself.
ugh, that's because you float.
he has his own goals... and struggles. after all, the aeon of beauty has likely already fallen.
i'm... just doing my job...
as for tonight... let's go to old goethe's place and have a big feast to celebrate!
don't worry. no matter the quantity, i'll carry them for you!
see that robot over there, the one that looks like a jellyfish? that's probably one of the service robots madam herta was talking about, right?
most of the tourists around at the moment are here to attend the wardance, and that's why we're here too.
more importantly than that, even though it's a work of fiction, we have to deliver a sense of realism.
i've heard people everywhere tell tales of your heroics, and i've seen it first-hand adventuring with you.
right. let's head back to ogura textiles & kimonos and give our hard-won silk to the shopkeeper.
to be clear, i've never had any hand in setting the price. i, too, was rather surprised to see it become so expensive.
good, i've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the underworld.
we have no means to wake them up now. not even your clockwork will do the trick.
ugh, what's his deal? who falls asleep standing up anyway!?
you should probably ask bronya to explain it to you.
such tight security... i bet they're stumped by the case as well.
have you ever seen anyone outside of the crew interact with misha?
i didn't spend a great deal of time with her, but my impression was... she was a gentle god, who in each moment cherished the beauty of what was before her.
but where else could i go? the cat's tail? or the angel's share?
...miss topaz! i never thought i'd run into you on penacony.
this calls for brainwaves, not "brawnwaves." how about i take you over myself?
stop smirking at me! i told you, it was an objective evaluation, not a compliment! not a compliment!
it'll be quite worth the wait. especially yours, i assure you... hehe...
okay, alright. i get it, you want to bargain a little more. but our offer as it stands is already quite a good deal, don't you think?
a normal person in this situation would simply say: "hi traveler, how have you been?"
i think that's how he drew inspiration from the meteor shower...
hmm? whatever are you talking about? i don't understand. i'm simply here for the book review session with miss sole of the deep.
if it's not me, then why does she look exactly like me? and if she is me, then... who am i?
since we've embarked on two very different paths to eternity, i can either continue to maintain the status quo or do whatever it takes to bring her back on track, regardless of the cost...
r--really? then, let me bake some muffins for you when we get back...
if we travel north from here, we should reach the stone gate, and from there, we will be within the boundaries of mondstadt.
actually... i want to know too. but as a guest on the express, it would be impolite to touch anything.
if it's only a few games... by all means.
...actions? ohhhh, i get you! another plate of delicious snacks, coming right up!
someone's full of energy! you... don't look like a xianzh--
ahaha, yes, ours was as far from a close call as you could get. all it took was a few short, sharp strikes for blitzara and i...
here you go. is it possible to treat this as an urgent order?
you're not from this world, are you?
it seems like your friend still has a lot of growing to do.
just outside the mall is the plaza. follow me! i'll buy you a nice meal!
okay then, moving straight on to the next lot.
there's no point in resisting, mister norbert. your accomplices have been subdued. there's nowhere to run.
haha, there's nothing to worry about -- you've arrived at the dreamscape.
right then, lunch is over. i assume you have something planned next? although...
could there be other things similar to what yanming got? we should take a look.
with what power belobog currently holds, we are far from being able to assist the nameless... however, i do hope that one day we can provide you with reliable support.
what!? argenti wants to leave the express and fight the giant sting alone!?
anyway... about the something i needed your help with.
chef mao, i will go with your recommendation!
we couldn't cajole adeptus xiao in the end. he said he'd take a peek from the peaks, but that was all he'd agree to. it's a real shame -- i had the perfect poem for his entrance and everything.
well, never mind. what about one of you, then? anyone who can defeat me, takatsukasa or not, will be appointed the new tenryou commissioner.
in any case, if your goal is also to become the champions, then it's likely you'll run into them sooner or later.
this place is an endless stream of people... where do we start?
that's the most important outcome of this trip. to be honest, i wasn't expecting you'd make such great progress when i lent you the pass permit.
you're welcome! as the host of this gathering, i hope everyone enjoys the food and drinks. may this year be better than the last!
it's like one of those messages a kidnapper sends in a horror movie...
as a representative of the xianzhou luofu, i will defeat all challengers!
what did he say? that i'm good at solving people's problems?
judging by how the battle turned out, qlipoth responded to your wish. their gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the colossus.
all in all, the mission is going super smoothly!
fear not. fighting is what i do best.
haha, you make it sound so abominable. i'm just trying to get them to see the humor in it all.
huh? what's wrong? why aren't you saying anything?
no one can remain undefeated for an eternity...
these shops and signs... why do i feel like i've seen them before?
...we encountered a problem during the renovation process. the silvermane guards are doing all they can to figure it out.
no clue, but i know one thing...
i'm fine... just a little light-headed is all...
yes... she is a high-ranking member of the ipc, after all. she knows how to use words to her advantage.
my, look at you with your ingenious schemes!
...actually, i was wondering if diviner fu could do me a favor.
for now, while i figure out the form that eternity should take, it's more effective for me to temporarily disable some of the puppet's functions rather than attempt to modify her rules.
i prefer snacks to entrees. i always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as i go. by the way, are you any good at making snacks? i'll trade the dango i made with you. here, have the big ones!
he is my friend! to think that not long ago, we were... all eating hotpot together...
so we have to clean up and reorder the footage ourselves?
and anyway, to your point about collaboration... you've been helping out too, right?
i'd say that captain beidou has eyes that can pierce the sea. you're an adventure-seeking pioneer who tames the wind and the waves... which is clearly indicative of someone who grew up by the sea.
something i never have the opportunity to do...
...did that all get a little heavy for you? i think you prefer me when i'm just teasing you, don't you? hehe...
it's the first i'd heard of it too, so i compared the map from the book against the current topography of mondstadt. apparently, pilos peak no longer exists.
no chance? hey, are you trying to crush my confidence? i'm the kind of girl who performs better when i'm showered with praise, just so you know.
my "origin," huh... i don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
of course. i am also a "guide" of sorts, you know. so naturally, i also have a great sense of direction.
if you have any quibbles, we can bring people to corroborate what i've said, and all will come to light.
a chat? is there some commercial matter you wish to inquire about?
ha, i'm the queen of vigilance, thank you very much. i don't trust anyone except dan heng, mister yang, himeko, and you.
...the order to seal off the underworld from the overworld. with the passage of time, she gradually came to realize the consequences of that decision... although tortured with guilt, she could not undo the damage.
but... let's say i do become a knight in the future, maybe... maybe i will simply continue to do the same things that i am doing right now...
anyway, we've got all the materials we need now, so that solves that problem!
should we really be bragging about something like this...
yes, it's still on repeat... ah! there we go.
wait, miss tingyun, why are you still here!? you're too close to the crucible!
do you still remember? the script said that i will experience "death" three times in the land of dreams.
i... have been trying to do that...
(the angler is both a detective and a fighter!)
publicly insulting the supreme guardian only elevates the seriousness of your crimes. throw down your arms and surrender!
did everyone definitely have the same dream? and where exactly were they in the dream? these are the questions that we need answers to.
so, you must be the one who needed my help?
we are guardians, mother! chosen from among the masses! our duty is to preserve the world built by humanity! we are not gods! we are not arbiters!
in the past, only the most skilled swordsmen of a reputable clan in inazuma were qualified to be the archon's emissary. i'm afraid my skills can't even begin to compare to theirs.
are there any particular snacks you like? i can get started with--
i have to admit, if this is the taste of coffee... i can't help but feel sorry for those who shell out a fortune for it.
this is the only advice i have for you, from someone burdened with a blood debt.
really? then what do you usually eat when you're out on an inspiration walk?
leave it to me. stick close guys, and don't get spotted.
alright, i'm in good spirits. is there anything you wish to know?
well i'm still me. there is no doubt about that.
penacony, the planet of festivities, the universe's biggest and fanciest amusement park awaits!
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want.
...huh, that's weird. i bet the conductor won, right?
don't worry, little layla. they're just apologizing to me for defeating souka. go buy yourself a nice drink, take a break, and catch your breath.
hehehe, oh, but i have so much to say to you. let me tell you all that has happened over the last few centuries.
hey, what's that commotion? it sounds like there's a big argument happening...
and one particular guardian, cocolia, abandoned the path of preservation altogether. in contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the amber lord.
at present, it has become impervious due to people's desire to remain slumbering within the dream. and in order to destroy it...
i'll leave it to you then. i'm gonna follow right behind you.
oh? it's been a while. did pom-pom call you back?
...yeah. so what?
not only that, but the room is getting colder.
if that's the case, i... i shall be glad to help to the fullest extent that i am able.
you say that conceit and cowardice lie in the depths of human nature -- perhaps you're right... desperation sheds light on the darkest recesses of the heart.
oh, really? then i won't disturb you.
our eyes and ears are more than sufficient. you two are very interesting people, after all. it would be natural to take an interest.
so how big was it? bigger than the express? bigger than herta space station? no, that can't be right.
y'know, just basic strength and endurance training...
heck, i entertain my fair share of fantasies too... the fire diamond that spins around and shoots out lights that are all the colors of the rainbow... ooh -- the mist spirits that live far off in the mountains and guide you to fairyland if you can find them...
nope. although it is used by us in place of surnames, it generally just means "great."
excuse me, are you talking about the clock studios theme park incident?
you don't know the half of it! those ipc mechs pack a huge punch!
as long as we can gain access permissions to the hub, we can operate the gear bridge terminals.
"an old melon on a vine, a new flower that grows fine."
it's really you. i knew i didn't get the wrong person.
we're here. hey, have you ever heard of this saying that goes, "in a dream, hunger is the most precious spice?"
this exorcism device? people like you wouldn't recognize it, but it's just an old ley line monolith, deceptively effective at attracting monsters.
don't you think a tournament like this makes a perfect candidate for light novel treatment?
hmm? wait a moment, child. you're not planning to just leave it at that, are you?
and its meaning will be interpreted by those who come after -- us.
oh? i didn't expect to find my favorite hot springs here. you wouldn't mind it if i took a soak for a while, would you?
don't worry, i won't always be as busy as this... it'll be quite nice to work on some other skills when i have the time.
we lived in the same dormitory, went to the same school together every day, ate together, whiled away the time together... and occasionally talked about music together -- though it wasn't something she was overly familiar with.
let's see... a little over one thousand mora.
over countless battles, not once have you lost, and never have you shown the slightest hesitation.
no, no, that's not what i meant. let's pretend you're an akademiya student, hard at work.
should we ever cross paths again, i'd love for you to visit the express.
like i said... it's only one meal away.
understood! i shall demonstrate for master the dazzling ninjutsu i just learned!
therefore, i must carry out my maidly duties.
whoa... she sounds like a big deal.
everyone who owns this chess set will preserve this moment in history in a vivid and compelling form.
are you two... *gasp* the people in dark clothing? what's with the wardrobe change?
i want to keep on living. and for that, i'm willing to give up everything i have.
stop right there... i... won't allow you to insult the madam guardian.
i wondered whether he was a friend of yours, but my instinct told me he wasn't.
my orders are to arrest you. it is for the adjudication panel to present you with the nature and penalty of your alleged crimes.
it's been a while since i've let loose. let's get this started!
and running two laps around mondstadt as a morning routine.
you're just here for the show!
keep your nonsense to yourself, thank you very much.
however, even though it's only training... i can't raise my sword against the honorary knight.
alright, just kidding. just trying to liven things up around here.
that's... a possibility!
...i believe so. the shogun and the tenryou commission see the ceremony as a milestone. with the one hundredth vision, they wish to mark the success of the vision hunt decree to date.
...but what about those simply struggling for survival, fighting for something better? i've witnessed their light on the front lines, in the underworld... in places you have overlooked.
dango with milk... hmm, i've never heard of it. what made you want to do this?
*sigh* there are many types of friend... she's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.
i've got a lot going on right now, but i'll try to make it next time.
no! i got so caught up with working that i completely forgot we were here to gather intel.
a brilliantly ruthless rendition of the ninja mantra, baseball bat ninja!
uhh... th--that's beside the point.
i can't believe you drew that card, against all the odds...
what an overwhelming presence... certainly worthy of being the almighty shogun's chosen envoy.
but from the whispers of the residents, i've heard a familiar name... gallagher.
i... if it's not too much trouble... could i ask you for some guidance on my chivalric training?
ah, how wonderful. everyone's keeping their promises today.
anyway, you should watch and learn, because i plan on using some more of my "little tricks" to defeat that divine priestess from watatsumi island.
in an attempt to select the most suitable ingredient, i gathered samples of all the sweet plants and fruits i could find in the mondstadt area. then, i tried them all in turn and took detailed notes.
i don't usually say things like this, but while we're on the topic, i really hope you don't confuse astrology with those fortune stick peddlers that you see along the streets.
if you're interested, i'd be quite happy to do a reading for you two.
hey now, zhongli, don't just praise everything you hear! you should question and press them a bit, don't worry about upsetting anyone! after all, i'm here to take the heat!
maybe the artisanship commission are just more dedicated to their work? the divination commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow...
as a maid, i must do my best in receiving and escorting such visitors.
in this vast sea of stars, there are stars for you, for me, for everybody.
here we are, everwinter monument! photo time!
whoa! don't sneak up on me like that!
i would've never expected that trying to make desserts taste better was an expression of hope.
mine cart pin... mine cart wheelset... confirm... just like that?
it looks like "she" will no longer allow me to do with this body as i please.
i am very interested in... in experiencing the adventurer's entrance exam!
as you can see, this house is right next to the restaurant. it's where the owner lives.
huh? you don't look that tired to me... stop playing around.
you spent so much time in belobog on your last visit -- you must have passed by here before, right?
ah, so it was you guys. i guessed as much from the way the kids described you. no worries, though, i'm not blaming you.
maybe she was just in awe of the director's aura?
is that fair to say, ninja initiate patissier?
aw, thanks, but i'm just your average artisan. the quiet life suits me better.
an outstanding piece of musical work is just like a mirror. only through comparison and reflection can shortcomings be found in time.
don't worry, sakujirou. so far, at least, everything is going according to plan.
maybe around thirty... or forty percent?
is there really flying emergency food in other worlds? how does it taste? and how do you cook it?
the quicker we handle the ipc, the faster we can get back to enjoying the celebrations. let seele know when you're ready to go.
seriously? nobody just uses a scryglass whenever they've got time to just see who they'll meet on the road.
every day i see silvermane guards sacrifice their lives in the fragmentum, but i've never had the resolve to change mother's mind.
but, how we can get him to do that... showing him some of our photos wouldn't cut it, right?
your match is over too? you took your time. i'm assuming it was a close call...
heh... hehe... miko, i never thought i would have the chance to meet with you like this again.
in any case, this fiasco has been going on right under our noses for too long. regardless of how cunning and talented the culprit may be, we must draw them out and demonstrate the resolve of the architects.
i believed you were incapable of transcending the past. but it seems my belief was baseless and i underestimated your spirit.
that was when ei began to change. makoto was her greatest loss.
besides, don't you want to chit-chat with the locals now that belobog is full of life again? i know i do!
hehe, i just love the name blubberbeast. just wait till pops and the others hear about this, they probably won't believe a word i say!
i--i don't need comforting, thank you very much! i'm very tough, you know!
i asked her to guide me to a place beyond the family's reach and to contact a few trustworthy individuals, namely all of you.
ugh... it's the thought that counts.
in that case, the vote stands at two to one.
hold them back, i will be there immediately!
he kept harping on about dan heng being a "true warrior" or something...
mm, we should be going to see wildfire. let's move.
what's wrong, bronya? do you feel sick?
the timescale of dreamflux reef differs from reality, so we mustn't lower our guard. you're sensitive to memoria -- a slight misstep, and you could get lost in this memory zone.
this road... are we heading back to the oti mall?
where is he now? does he have plans to visit inazuma? if so, i will instruct one of the commissioners to bring him to me on his arrival. i would very much like to spar with him.
don't look at me like that. i've never had to tinker with the shogun before, and she's very complicated. it's practically inevitable for something to go wrong when you start tweaking things.
i recommend a mushroom pizza and a satisfying salad too on the side.
fischl's dilemma was indeed within herself. but there was only one phantom, not a swarm... so my guess was a little off the mark.
dazzling ninjutsu: brilliant enlightenment!
no... i still have training tomorrow, i must freshen up...
i won't design any more rules that can never be changed.
finding balance is an essential concept in liyue culture.
i especially like the head of the club. great character design. she really has rock 'n' roll coursing through her veins. i can almost feel the heat from that fire in her soul. approved!
"ride the wind and go off on a big adventure." klee, your mom sounds like a very cool person.
i'll do some serious planning and make sure we can have a day off together another time!
here, keep it... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
that's very kind of you. but i know i'm no match for a professional adventurer like yourself.
didn't we agree to do a thorough investigation? let's go!
ohh... maybe i am not yet ready to carry out the work of a fully qualified knight...
i can clearly hear everything they're saying... is my superhearing capable of picking up even whispers among ninjas now? a joyous discovery indeed.
for us to meet now is premature. nevertheless, you set foot on these islands at precisely the right moment.
anyway, we can't leave the stellaron unchecked. this is about trailblazing a bright future for penacony and fulfilling mikhail's and his predecessors' long-cherished wishes.
it's up to you... do you wanna try something different?
you want to come as well? but you look quite tired.
this game is truly unpredictable...
i borrowed every book on love from the library that i could find.
should both the performers and spectators fail to arrive, won't all of aventurine's plans be for nothing?
master kucha, do i... count as a "ninja initiate" now?
...i can't help but think that whether it's mister mikhail, mister tiernan, or madam razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories...
"square meals in the basement: big bowls of rice, decorate with cuboids of meat."
ooh my, such a stand-out personality, and with the perfect dose of obstinacy... i sense dramatic events just waiting to unfold.
if elder huaiyan accepts the explanation, so do i.
we're back. everything's all sorted.
uhm... don't, you're freaking me out...
she was pretty shy at first, but i explained that i just arrived in sumeru and had gotten lost, so i needed someone to help guide me...
ah? oh, yes, that's right...
he ran away! ah... w--what should i do now...
you must be pretty tired, mister giovanni.
yeah, it's been a while, and i thought i should let the express know that i'm safe and sound here.
we better think about what we're gonna say. she might be young, but she is an ipc executive -- she's definitely no pushover.
that's very kind of you, thank you. goodbye for now.
ehhh... even without the author coming forward, i can confidently declare this answer wrong! how does eating pizza broaden your mind!?
i will keep seeing what the stars say every day.
we moved from that building to this building in the blink of an eye... this would be impossible in reality.
i cannot. in my current state, even if i went out, i could do nothing.
so this class is about painting?
hehe... it's mainly sour with just a tinge of sweetness, and a lingering aftertaste.
huh? that's sooner than i expected. is she well enough to...
uhh, yeah, of course -- this isn't my first expedition y'know. my powers of perception are sharper than the sharpest blade~
you knew how important that comb was to nannan, and you exploited that fact to emotionally manipulate her.
although, if clara hadn't been here... svarog would never have granted us access to the intel, right? even up until the end.
how should i put this... there's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
i believe you, there's no way you could have invented all those twists and turns. what's more, we have miss seele here as living proof. as for the stellaron... heh, i know why bronya got you to find me.
of course, pops is happy to listen to me chatter away... but because he can hardly hear anything, it's difficult to get an interesting reaction from him...
don't run! i got you, hook!
...okay, whenever you're ready, but don't take too long!
yeah, maybe that's the precise thing i can't let go of...
yep, touch it and find out -- ice cold. i was just about to fix it up.
...but where to start? i can't imagine what i would need to do to become more like master jean...
now who should i send... hmm... miyuki, perhaps?
there's a saying -- the more demanding the diner, the stronger the skills of the chef... but no matter what others say, i'll always be demanding more from myself.
one who wears a blade must use it to cut eventually. and when a gambler has nothing to lose on the table, he will surely go for broke and bet it all on a final hand... that is all i can say.
he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
hehe, told you i'm good at this.
nothing's wrong, okay? come on. we're going to war.
there are no permanent allies or everlasting enemies. so, let's both... take what we need from this deal.
but shrewdness is easily perceived as cynicism in the eyes of others. people come to think of you as someone who cares only about money, and not people.
but the best-laid plans of snow mice and men often go awry... they didn't realize the parts would interfere with the robots' systems and cause them to run amok.
you... when did you get here?
(creating a whole world's starscape is no easy task...)
you mean the watchmaker's guests? that's a pity... based on my experience, i don't think any of them can turn the tide on this situation.
campus life without homework or examinations? that sounds like paradise!
hehe, i won't be modest this time. my skills have improved by leaps and bounds!
...that girl really needs to step up. i can't believe her own employee doesn't even know her name...
do you wanna join me? relaxing in a hot spring, chatting away, ahh, it's one of the greatest feelings!
how else can i take it back? by copying it on paper? i can't carry that much paper on my own.
we were training nearby and happened to hear you calling my name. luckily, we got here just in time.
perfect timing. now that everyone's here, i'd like to introduce everyone to micah, who's partly in charge of the land of the exiles. micah, these are my companions.
yes... this is where we put an end to it all...
some words are not to be passed on.
you know, we're kind of similar, with both of us having a brother.
fiendling pest! what tricks did you pull on ninja initiate merchant?
exactly. gallagher suggests that the real traitor is someone else... probably within the oak family.
are you two professional time-wasters or something?
have you heard of the song? it's called if i can stop one heart from breaking, by robin. her songs are played in the dreamland from time to time as the charmony festival is drawing close.
i'll be looking into building a more optimal deck. it's a formal competition after all, and i shouldn't make a fool of myself.
...back to copying me, huh?
look at me, cocolia! don't you dare look away...
so you've decided to resurrect a dead aeon? no one's ever done such a thing.
my opponent was no pushover. we both took out a couple of each other's character cards before it came down to the decisive round.
strange... why spend two hours in such a confined area? he must've been up to something...
absolutely! knitting is totally an art form!
as expected, compared to the honorary knight, i still have a long way to go...
no, i'm not getting any flashbacks. please -- do i look xianzhouish to you? you must be thinking of dan heng.
what a huge palace -- completely abandoned... that must have been difficult for them -- imagine how upset you'd be if you had to abandon me!
...managing a successful business is not as simple as you might think. capital, connections, sensitivity to the trends, an instinct for what is a good opportunity... all of these traits are crucial.
you see! helping me will be worth your while... come on then, my able assistants! let's get down to liyue harbor and do some business!
be gone, fiendlings! or i shall give you a taste of my dazzling ninjutsu!
the stellaron issue concerns the life and death of everyone on penacony. if anyone has a better suggestion, the crew is more than willing to listen. also, it'd be best to tell us the ins and outs of that meeting--
we've talked it over, and we've decided to escort you back to mondstadt!
in the spirit of friendship and poetry-sharing, i managed to successfully organize the "neighboring nations congenial poetry gala"!
are you tired, paimon? do you want to take a break?
so riddle me this: if i didn't do anything to lift the curse, then what's the cause of your sudden recovery?
just as i thought, leonard was an adventurer who lived two thousand years ago.
if there's something you've got to do, do it now. better than regretting it further down the line.
ahh, this dessert is so tasty. i can feel my whole body relaxing...
thank you, mister giovanni. while you're here... mind if we ask you a few questions?
you said you need clues, right? in that case, mona megistus the astrologist will provide you with a personally handwritten letter. just wait for it to show up in your mailbox!
i put up posters, just like all the other shops, but the millelith promptly removed them.
hehe, what an adorable little girl. well, that settles it. aratani, make sure it gets printed with tonight's batch!
mister giovanni! i guess it's not that surprising...
wait a sec, did gepard say that he's in rivet town? could that mean topaz is...
i know that you only want to be seen by people you trust. it's rash of me to butt in...
you'll find several lamps like this around the victory zone. once you've illuminated all of them, seek out me and serval. we'll be ready to throw down the gauntlet!
hmm... quite impressive.
before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto, once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
while i'm gone, dad's in charge of making fireworks. you've seen how skilled he is, so there's nothing to worry about.
looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of the hunt.
i bet nowhere else you've been is quite like inazuma, huh?
i will now begin the process of hydromancy. stay back, and do not impede my vision.
you should prepare more adequately next time.
a satisfying trade to be in, though, and wangsheng funeral parlor is well-known around town. whatever the request, i'd be glad to hear it.
well, i was really hoping you would say that such sacrifice could at least be used as some leverage in our negotiations.
oh, you mean my poems, right? ahem. it's been forever since i performed in front of someone. one sec... get ready!
unfortunately, since i didn't manage to procure one for myself, i'm unable to say for sure.
i've been great, of course. every day is a happy one.
look at them, standing there like statues! it might be tricky getting around these two.
belobog's future is not for sale, and we'll never forget the friends who stood by us in our time of need -- not once, but twice.
after the general hall opened to the public, the silvermane guards and wildfire did a follow-up investigation in the underworld.
c'mon, let's race! lemme see how good you really are!
we should proceed with caution. the kujou clan descendant may well be in trouble.
i wouldn't want general jing yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
yes. five hundred years ago, a great catastrophe befell inazuma.
could this be some sort of metaphor? perhaps the "sea" refers to the memory zone?
hehe, so full of energy.
this stone harbors an unbelievable amount of elemental energy, and human desire. it's the core alright.
are you worried about those two? welt is with them. they should be fine.
real-world fighting experience?
you said earlier that there was nothing amazing about astrologists... well then, this is a good time to show you what your master can do.
whoa, paimon wasn't kidding! the statue really did move. wonder how that works...
this assertive aggression... silvergun shura's words, before they were sealed, must have been just as fierce as yours.
this doesn't feel very "me." is this okay?
but in doing so, i neglected my old clients. you're right, it's unfair.
peace is our greatest wish -- beyond that, we desire nothing else.
"business development"? is that what you see this as?
it is a pleasure to meet the both of you as well, nameless ninjas. i am rappa, aka the dazzling ninja.
that doesn't sound so bad. the xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
general jing yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, i'll take care of it for you. you need the final word from the ten-lords commission to quell any doubts.
haha, maybe it does, but i knew what i was getting into from the moment i agreed to help him.
i find it hard to trust anything you've just said...
i wouldn't be surprised if there are... the silvermane guards have a lot to make amends for down here.
we were supposed... to fly into the sky together.
why would he leave exalting sanctum via a secluded dock? that's so suspicious!
the charmony festival will start soon. there's one thing that... i need to confirm no matter what. a warp jump is the best way to do so.
i have much to contemplate in the days to come. but at least i can now see the way ahead.
what, you're leaving already? but you haven't asked me about my dreams! i've been working hard too, you know!
i envy your close friendships.
well try this on for size -- nope! i can't stand anymore of this fighting, so there!
uh... are you alright?
if i wasn't ningguang, gou san'er probably wouldn't have handed all of these over to us.
i wish you both safe travels! as for me... i need to think of the future as well.
phew! we did it! we've gained access to the gear bridge. let's move.
hello. may i ask what happened here?
personally, i think the idea of things staying the same forever is quite beautiful. *sigh* but alas, that is simply not the way the world works.
umm, this is getting a little complicated... is there a... simpler explanation?
it's okay if you don't know her exact size. you can always just buy her a few bolts of silk instead! who knows, maybe she'd like that even better.
can't we do the questioning here? the stellaron hunters are slippery, what if she makes a break for it?
but training progress has been a little slow...
yeah, skott couldn't come up with a comeback.
it appears that the seafarer has nothing to do with the watchmaker. so, perhaps it's just a coincidence?
or, to put it another way, i see this as the "jade chamber" that belongs to you.
i see. you have been through a lot since we last met.
*sigh* don't worry about it. i get what you're trying to say, i do! it's just... i need some time.
the galaxy is endlessly vast. i wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
w-what's miss black swan doing here?
were you distracted during our match? hehe, i could tell.
before i knew it, i was breathing like normal down there! it was an amazing feeling! ayaka said i was too nervous and needed to loosen my grip. she got used to everything way faster than i did!
of course i did. if i make you a promise, i will always keep it.
there's no other way... we'll have to fight.
navigators really do have their plates full, huh? seems like it's just you and me this time.
just look at her! xiangling, the disciple of an adeptus, the stove god's best companion, the winner of the masterful chefs competition.
oh for the love of... no, of course not! you told me yourself that you'd left a message with katheryne!
it doesn't matter to me how small these things are, or how tiring...
i tried to perform a divination, but my scryglass showed only a chaotic mess that was impossible to decipher.
...for example, "woof woof, woof woof woof woof!"
we youkai are not like humans. humans have too short a lifespan, and the day will inevitably come we when must say goodbye.
hmm, only problem is... the view here isn't great. are you sure we'll be able to watch the aurora?
who would've guessed... it seems that power was indeed left behind by the old hag after all...
i sure will! i wasn't planning to study anyway!
...seems like similar things happen every time i'm with you. i'll attempt divination, read the signs, zero in on the target, then solve the problem.
jokes? um, i... don't really have a good sense of humor...
they are confined to the water, and yet they live free, swimming around wherever the mood takes them.
look, everyone. isn't this the dango milk we are searching for?
galaxy ranger, acheron... this is what they call me. you can call me whatever you want. we will likely meet again.
ying'er is every bit as proficient as any of the top tailors in the land. i've availed myself of her services many times before.
by the way, you remember that norbert guy we captured? the silvermane guards have acquired new intel from him -- i thought you might find it interesting.
no matter what you make of it, it's quite incredible.
oh nothing, just something meng's been pleading with me to take care of. should be a piece of cake.
let's go. once this stage play concludes... it'll be time for the main event -- the charmony festival.
b--bronya? you're here just in time! things were about to get out of control!
they won the archon war together, and when baal established the shogunate, beelzebul became her kagemusha, or "shadow warrior." in other words, she acted as baal's body double.
me? none. what cocolia and the architects get up to has nothing to do with me. my time is too precious for pondering.
i'll help you. no matter where it is, you must be reunited!
...so, come with me. i'll take you home.
i say that, but honestly, you two probably caught the majority of what she said.
i think so. that's what the manuscript says anyway.
the journey may be short, but the memories will last forever~
no... so my teddy bears and bunnies are gonna be liquefied by stomach acid? i've had them for ages... i need to find a way to save them.
well, it seems that your answers have addressed all my questions.
huh, i guess i never looked at it from that angle... i wouldn't wish that title on anyone.
...i've gotta say, this puzzle is pretty unorthodox...
no, but-- ahh...
hmm, well, if something bad happens, don't expect me to pick up the pieces.
these stairs... they seem to have become more narrow.
well, i must say that quite a few of my doubts have been dispelled.
ah... so you came here to make a little oni's wish come true, hmm?
they've already left, leaving this kindhearted girl to wake you up. you owe her big time.
okay guys, take a look over here: this is everwinter monument. it was erected to commemorate the mighty architects.
hee-hee, no matter what you say, i'm staying here today and no one can drag me away!
...so you're looking after your brother on your own? that must be hard.
ahahahahahaha, oh, urakusai, you haven't changed a bit. you caught on so quickly. too perfect.
looks like this is the last riddle that mister gallagher left for us.
are you yinshu, the shopkeeper at spare time book shop? there's something we want to talk to you about.
then... defeating the evil ninja?
that's a story for another time. nothing's more important than ensuring the safety of the countless people on this land of dreams.
the theme of the second day of the "neighboring nations congenial poetry gala" is... pairing couplets!
this again... don't tell me, it's gotta be...
you bet i am! paimon, you agree too, right? did i show those fatui who's boss or what?
let's get going then. paperfold university is located in the moment of sol. the hotel has set the entrance to the dream near the school, so let's meet at the gates!
ooh, how quaint. that was your beidou impression, was it?
together with norbert's mumblings about a "shopping street..." i think all these clues are pointing in one direction.
that includes you and paimon, too, of course.
that's right, i'm the first one, he's the second! we're here to help!
in that case, try wuwang hill. i think that's where he should be.
it'll certainly require one heck of a clean-up.
this... appears to be true... we must find another approach...
it was no problem at all. just my duty as a maid of favonius!
aw, i lost... i need to improve!
the feeling of creating your wealth with your own two hands is just as exhilarating as ever.
himeko, mister yang! team trailblaze, back from duty! mission one: accomplished!
the family invited you here, right? i--i'd be happy to show you around!
it's not your first time. i don't see what there is to be so alarmed about.
it's just... i see people fighting for their lives and here i am thinking about how to escape... i feel guilty about that.
the shogun and i will closely review the inazuma of today to find out where things currently stand. then, we will give careful consideration to the future.
i haven't fought with gepard since he enlisted. he could never beat me when we were little, but now...
so he paid for the book and tore off the title page to protect people from the spoiler...
since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. i never thought i'd enter the underworld that has been sealed away for so long...
there i was getting excited to tell everyone the good news...
sure, we have to attend classes sooner or later anyway. dreamweaving class is at the stage plaza. let's go take a look.
he's as stubborn as i am. it could be an argument or a fight -- he'll do both to the death... that's why he bugs the heck out of me!
it's good to see you're unharmed. allow me to introduce you to miss black swan, memokeeper of the garden of recollection.
it seems kinda complicated...
many things have changed now that inazuma is at peace. however... it seems that some people continue to fear the "divine light" just as before.
ahem... i understand. looks like the crew have similar feelings... don't worry, i won't tell anyone.
speaking of solutions... are they repairing that giant robot -- the one we fought against? i remember you took control of it and helped us defeat cocolia!
don't just sit there, zhongli! go welcome our guest in!
many stores have monthly sales. find an opportune time to stock up on grains and dried foods. as staple foods, they will keep you feeling full for a long time.
please forgive my lack of courtesy for receiving you in this fashion... especially following such a long and wearisome journey over the sea.
i feel something that doesn't belong here... i sense danger.
oh, so polite!
it's okay. pom-pom, just let it all out.
this is the land of the dreams, but why do they live like this?
talking about the beauty of nature, it is important to mention that the people of inazuma believe that everything has its own spiritual essence.
but my strengths are not in scouting and luring the enemy, and i'm not as agile as amber. hmm... i don't know if i would be of any assistance to her...
although there are some parts in the results that i don't quite understand... it's as if there is some sort of power surrounding us, and it's still watching us.
that's about all we can do about a stellaron. it may be suppressed for now, but it's only a matter of time before it regains power.
of course we included paimon. this is the story of everyone's big, happy adventure with dodoco.
*sigh* if i'd known how much work that was going to be, i would've enlisted more help...
no, no, it's nothing like that. this has nothing to do with drinking or with fischl's visits, you all need to calm down...
himeko and mister yang and... who was it again? anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
it sounded like it came from inside the shrine.
thoughts from the experts? are we able to work with this general framework to make an interesting story?
no, wait. to be more accurate, it's urakusai's memory.
and if i had failed to offer our hospitality on such an occasion, despite there being no evidence to back up your claims...
you intend to stop her achieving victory? i can't say i didn't expect that response from you. but i hear she's one of the favorites to win this tournament... are you prepared to face such a formidable opponent?
who knows? i don't remember anything before that.
it's the power of tuning... don't let the song distract you!
mister zhu, you must take care of such precious things a bit better. you might not be so fortunate next time.
calling starskiff haven. have all cloud knights be on full alert for borisin attacks!
those things we saw flickering in and out, that's exactly what i saw earlier this morning!
should we report them as missing or deceased?
a--are you backing out now!? we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
...sorry, did you have something you wanted to say to me?
not only have you stopped paying attention to the world, but you have stopped paying attention to yourself.
i think so too! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
i've got it! perhaps the dried fruits that i prepared for my exam could help him to sober up?
ah! stop talking! if there is someone here, they're in my bad books already.
we're not that old ourselves, right? and yet here we are -- express passengers on trailblazing expeditions!
since fate saw fit to bring us together, may i know your name before we part ways?
why are there seven people all striving to have a relationship with a single male protagonist? is this some sort of narrative device, too?
the faint singing that emanates from golden theater, the sound of hurried footsteps in the early morning, the night-time tranquility of qlipoth fort... i know they might seem contradictory, but i like all of them.
just tell them it's from yoimiya. they'll know what it's about.
mmm... the bittersweet taste of nostalgia.
...but all they're really after are my words... any morsel of information that may hint at liyue's future commercial trends.
roughly every other day, i do a major clean-up for the knights of favonius.
once the projector is restored, the history-culture hall can reopen to the public. then visitors can enjoy all three of the museum's most important exhibits!
no need to be so cordial, mister xavier. we are all honored to be a part of this.
hehehe... i'm sorry. well then... time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. i'm counting on you.
ugh! just when i thought we'd get a minute to catch our breath!
you guessed it! everyone agrees that there is no better candidate than you.
really? sounds a little...
wow, nothing tangible then, but at least it sounds pretty cool...
could you allow him to calm down a bit before we register him with the knights?
when people live together it seems like nobody ever changes. only when they're away from each other for a long time do surprising transformations occur...
what was that all about!? *sigh* it does seem like you're on better terms after the fight.
...you gonna be this enthusiastic when it's jail-sentencing time?
well... we've realized that... no one really wants to play with us.
okay, so what exactly is "striking a pose"?
it looks like this gate has a more complicated structure than the last one...
are you sure? i still feel the choice of gift matters... no matter what kind of relationship two people share.
it's always nice to have a breath of fresh air after a meal. helps with digestion.
ha! that's more like it! new clues always turn up in the nick of time.
delicious. i feel much better after that. thank you.
it melted away not long after i was rescued.
you must have come across a particularly ferocious entity. how should i put this... most spirits are incapable of harming ordinary folks.
ah! you're just in time -- we haven't taken our selfie today.
hehe. don't forget we have a lunch later. save some space, or you might miss out on some even better food.
huh. i wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
...right after we finished chatting with topaz in the museum.
hmm... why don't you take a guess?
ha, even dan heng the sensible has his adventurous days!
here you go, take the match... and don't burn yourself! but if things go really wrong, here's a two for one coupon.
a fiendling... no, it is a dazzling fiendling under master kucha, though not directly. this fiendling harbors just as much hatred for evil ninja osaru.
this should be enough. let's head back to land and grill them.
osu! having persevered through unending nights of tribulations, i now boast... the unrivaled stature of a ninja hero.
anti-raiden shogun training. i've prepared a special program, just for you. come along now.
ah, boss, see these two faces here? remember them. they're the ones picking up the bill later.
this is a matter of pride and one's state of mind. if an astrologist thinks that their arts can solve all problems, they will be forsaken by the starry ether.
looks like we've rescued all the robots in this area too.
alright, give the poor child a break, herta.
he doesn't talk much about his past. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
looks like we've been downgraded to accomplices... again. seems like it's every third planet this happens.
it's really nothing that exciting.
quick as lightning, always keeping her word -- that was her way of doing things. back then... i thought we'd be friends for life.
i can't believe this has happened. was... someone killed again?
gepard, look! the miners have put up a makeshift defensive line!
what the heck is this? it looks like a walking gate...
ayato told me that we've already confirmed the dates for some inazuma-fontaine cultural exchange events.
i'm sorry for what happened... i was too focused on that girl, and got sloppy...
n--no, it's not like that!
so, it seems that some borisin have returned to stargazer navalia in disguise. the answer seems quite obvious...
the stars are a lie? what are you talking about?
i am glad to finally meet you in person, guests from the astral express. i'm feixiao, the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
(pu'er takes the page and goes to find the boss. before long, luocha sees an imposing figure walking towards him.)
but at least i have time to come visit you guys! did you miss me?
haha, the enthusiasm is cute, but don't think just because you're still figuring out the game that pela and i will take it easy on you!
because maybe it doesn't matter so much if something's real or not. maybe magic and awesomeness are what make something worth believing. why should someone else get to take that away from you?
heheh, after everything we've been through... you don't see me for a hot minute, and you're back to being scared of your own shadow.
that's enough, gepard. take a look around you! you're the last man standing!
tulipe, mother's been out for quite a while now.
oh...! sorry, i zoned out a little... i didn't notice you there...
whether we're chatting outside or inside, it's all the same.
the first thought i have when things don't work out is to run away. starting from today, that's no longer the case.
wildfire... i don't know anything about them. in all my time above ground, i never heard of this organization.
that's good to hear. otherwise, given that i am her familiar, it could have made our relationship rather awkward, don't you think?
whew, himeko~ what took you so long! that last wave of antimatter legion came at us like a swarm of locusts, have you ever tried shooting locusts with a bow?
*sigh* so shiny and pretty. i picked up this little guy in belobog's underworld.
though your power was weak, i was still able to find you. you were sitting in a tree, gazing at the tourists below.
i must have done something wrong! our visitor would never have left in such a hurry...
"botanical disaster"? it must be the ambrosial arbor...
i guess miss topaz is just doing her job. and as far as the express is concerned, i think it'd be unwise to make the ipc our enemy.
anyway, persikov's experiment did not go as planned. the machine broke down just days after it was activated. they tried to fix it, but...
is the starskiff haven always this crowded? there are so many people here! i can barely hear anything!
you can't change them? what does that mean...?
however, i hope it leaves you with a lasting impression of your trip to mondstadt.
kaedehara, please forgive my assumption, but perhaps you are thinking of the raiden gokaden?
there was me thinking that you might hang it around your neck to show off to the world, telling everyone who inquired that it was given to you by none other than yae miko, the wise and beautiful.
you remember my full name!? this kid is really something...
please have some tea, masters!
we'll follow march's plan. mister gallagher, will you be joining us?
oh, it's you, the saviors of this world. my scryglass is fine. but i'm not sure i can say the same about my eyes...
but this is her first time dealing with any of this. life can trip anyone up. what's most important in times like this...
wow! the skysplitter's gun salute is really loud! so this is what the wardance is actually like? i feel like my eardrums are going to burst.
never mind. i'll be honest with you then, i desire to spar with you.
and parries should be fluid and nimble! got it.
that's ninja ruri to you! farewell!
enough hiding, hoolay! come out and face me!
we made improvements to firecrackers and began setting them off during the lantern rite to commemorate the tenacious spirit of our ancestors.
and you, my little friend, are the perfect candidate for this role. hehehe...
don't worry, welt and himeko will have our backs if things go wrong. let's just make the most of it all while we're here.
i would never do such a thing. there was an important matter that required my attention.
the novel that i've been reading for a while finally reached its end. but the heroine lost her memory, and the planned wedding fell through... that's so... sad...
well, how about this: i'll join in as well! director hu tao, here to help out in your hour of greatest need! what does everyone think?
bronya! and... topaz? you're here too?
in that case, it's unanimous.
sucrose and i agreed to present the wine ingredient to you together. but when she heard that razor will be showing up, she insisted that she won't spend a moment longer here than she has to.
no no, just giving gifts isn't sincere enough... i should personally apologize to the conductor.
after the failed pursuit at backwater pass, the wanted outsiders and i were somehow taken to the underworld.
photo? ...this feels like one of my fan meet-ups, haha. anyway, for you guys, i'd do autographs for free.
um, serval... won't more silvermane guards be waiting for us on the other side of the gear bridge?
enough blubbing. if you didn't want to face the time, why do the crime? everyone is responsible for the decisions they make in life -- no exceptions.
there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
i thought that the flow of time was the same on the inside and the outside. so it was a great shock to me when the traveler re-appeared.
this is the second act. looks like it's about penacony's journey to becoming the land of the dreams, during which the family plays a crucial role.
i wanted to come here to perform for cocolia. to say goodbye...
that's part of it, but more importantly, i've been wondering why people link meteor showers and wishes in the first place.
the outer wall of the express is probably melting in gastric acid. i can't even imagine what it must look like.
the other method i'm trying is using the wooden tiles as coupons. just by writing things like "buy one get one free for the holder of this tile" on them.
if fate turns that page, our paths will cross again.
hold on... i hope you didn't bring that up just to poke fun at me?
the things miss tingyun left behind have finally found their homes.
this is land that was gifted to the yashiro commission by the shogun. the kamisato clan has the exclusive right to plan, build, and repair any property on this land -- and even to allow or deny access.
that's just the psychic bond between cute girls and cute puppies!
*sigh* ...this is taking longer than i imagined. at this pace, it'll take us the entire day to fix all these robots...
even if we'd done nothing at all, shingo would have eventually become too weak for his body to host the spirit, and it would have left of its own accord.
in other words, she's in charge of where the express goes.
it's also by chance that i've met so many people, learned so many things, and discovered that people associate watching fireworks with the things that are most precious to them.
don't mind him -- he's always like that. please enjoy the beautiful dreamscape the family has built for everyone. we shall take our leave. have a blast!
excellent! just as i expected -- short, sweet, and decisive. to the underworld it is, then.
when i run, time seems to flow especially slowly. being able to think at a leisurely pace is quite nice for someone with my impatience.
...what's wrong, mister yang? see anything fishy?
you take it easy -- i'll see if i can find one. oh, and i'll keep an eye out for food too!
an inner self fragment belonging to the sweet dreams troupe... this is just too surreal.
of course. i am a most generous master, after all. but only if you can finish it all. wasting food simply will not do.
indeed we did. it was the biggest difference between us.
making the stuffing requires pyro slime condensate, and the red dye used to grab the enemies' attention can be made from crushed valberries.
but it just didn't work -- i was grief-stricken, like a huge part of my heart was suddenly missing...
you're stronger than you look... seem to be quite the fighter.
miss black swan, do you not intend to open some sort of... teleporter?
thus, with unanimous consent from the five major lineages, penacony's family -- on behalf of all family members throughout the cosmos, offer a token of appreciation to the nameless.
black swan has arranged to meet a mourning actor there. i've heard they're preparing a special performance... i wouldn't mind going to enjoy the show.
yes! i think friendship is an extremely precious thing, and ours is one that i will always treasure.
so, that's why gepard and i came up with this idea. we'd like you to help us find out what's going on!
but, it's just half a year... don't you think that's quite soon?
has it sparked an interest in the business world for you?
we're looking for a stellaron -- it's the source of all the disasters here. if we find it, we can--
oh, so you're here to take part? well if we bump into each other out there you'd better be ready. this time we're gonna show you what we're really made of!
i cannot sense the slightest feeling of discord from this street... it is quite a rare find indeed.
yes, i just so happen to have something that i would like to ask you.
by the way... i heard that you had a duel before the throne, with a fatui harbinger no less. courageous and astute -- i must say, i am most impressed.
(i think she's enjoying herself...)
fate is called such precisely because it cannot be altered or reversed.
but persikov insisted on putting his machine to use. in order to achieve that, he disassembled the machine and used his connections to transport the parts to this deserted island.
don't worry, mister oleg, we'll make sure you don't regret it!
mister yang, do you mean... the stellaron is making the ambrosial arbor grow?
the new jade chamber is missing many of the contents held by its predecessor.
the environment... could it be that... the environment is what's interfering with my divinations?
i've heard people say that some evil spirits are sealed in shrines, and at night they make banging sounds from inside.
that's the path of the nameless, i presume? always on the road, always trailblazing...
wow, just from looking at these weapons, i can tell they have great power. this is the nation built by the geo archon, after all...
*sigh* but thinking about it, i feel a bit bad about clara... we promised her that our talks with svarog would go peacefully...
pfft! we took down the doomsday beast, the stellaron, and phantylia. did you really think you could stop us?
well hello there, my little helpers, so nice of you to join me. you're right on time, too.
that's righ-- hey! this is supposed to be a happy moment!
so, tell me. what is the matter?
i look forward to working with you again, hehe... i'm sure we will be even better partners.
look, there are so many students here! and so many booths. are they all set up by student clubs?
bronya? are you okay?
if it were really that profitable, those in the know would have kept it as quiet as possible. you have to wonder, if the news is spreading like wildfire, who's fanning the flames?
there there... chin up, pom-pom! don't be sad. don't cry...
so, you want to seize this opportunity to expose the watchmaker?
hmm... but i was so immersed in my thoughts at the time, i didn't realize how magnificent until i heard you speak...
i've heard that a skilled masked fool received an invitation too... that must be you, right? did you enjoy yourself?
so far, you have forged unbreakable bonds with numerous individuals and entities in the sweet dream.
if the momentum continues, and if the history-culture hall can reopen on schedule... the museum's complete revival is surely just around the corner!
but i've never seen any of the previous directors there, not even once.
i understand. let's do this.
even though it's been a day, i still break into a sweat when i think about it. our trailblazing expedition almost ended in penacony...
the pieces look like they flew to both sides of the room.
the dream penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. i've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
grr, that sampo cheated us all. wait till i get my hands on him...
yes. the youkai called their celebration the "mikawa flower festival." makoto and i attended it once... she found it particularly fascinating.
let's all take a rest here for now. when the mirage appears, we will get to the bottom of this mystery.
you asked if i view general jing yuan as my enemy... no, my real enemy has always been myself.
hehe. well, this is something only i can do, after all. so yes, your praises are quite welcome!
what a shame. that gentleman seemed like a sophisticated sort of guy. i actually think you two would have hit it off!
the person who tingyun trusts the most is madam yukong, right?
that person said she was a messenger. the garden of recollection... why would they come after me?
...one step closer. maybe soon i shall finally uncover the truth of this world?
so that's what's been happening -- no wonder we hadn't heard from bronya recently. *sigh* after all these years in isolation and without a single word from below, this is what's become of the underworld...
lighting the incense will signify continuous growth and prosperity in all our endeavors in the new year!
might i ask if you fear losing these bonds?
dan heng's speculations are usually right on the money. but even if we've guessed right, we can't go home now.
i'm also guessing that you like to curl up into a fetal position and hug your fluffy tail tight as you go off to sleep.
good morning. xavier said yesterday afternoon went well?
you don't need to worry about me. oleg guaranteed that i wouldn't be harmed. he seemed like a man of his word. go and rest.
so, let me introduce myself. i'm the intelligence officer for the silvermane guards, and a temporary guide for the "a journey through belobog's history" program. my name is pelageya sergeyevna.
hey, why are you blushing, master yanqing?
seriously? can't you just tell all of us?
wait, you're telling me i have to make this huge decision on the spot? at least give me a few seconds to think it over.
you two are looking pretty good. i trust you've been well?
that is a summary of our lives, encapsulating everything about us in these moments... proof of our shared path.
do you think... they're here to welcome us?
voidranger? was this planet invaded by the antimatter legion?
oh, nothing. it just seems extraordinarily chaotic, that's all. my suspicions have been confirmed.
i don't think he had that many legacies to leave behind...
to be brutally honest... for someone of your strength, there is nothing you could have done even if you had tried.
although i'm only here because fischl dragged me along, somewhere on the way, this turned into a wonderful summer.
yes... yes, we will. but not yet. before the hunt, we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
then i'll continue-- from the hearts of men, monsters arise, the banquet turns to scorched earth, laughter to cries, a passing hero lends a hand, ha -- no surprise.
there's no other grand theater in the dreamscape.
...when i traveled around inazuma with you, i caught a glimpse of how the nation has progressed over the centuries. a glimpse of human potential. everything far exceeded my expectations.
did you know what was about to happen in khaenri'ah?
how should i incorporate and play up the way of the dazzling ninja in my narration...?
you care about her, huh. you must have become close friends.
you can't work your way out of writer's block! a short break is a good way of refreshing the mind.
your ability never ceases to surprise me...
before you both arrived, topaz warned me that if payments were delayed, the ipc would give her the authority to employ "strong measures."
haha, that's what i wanted to hear. i was hoping it would leave a deep impression on you guys.
one represents the past, and the other the future. they both bloom in the sky, but have completely different meanings behind them.
with all these combat skills i've learned from you, i should just become an adventurer on the side -- apart from my day job making fireworks... or... should i just become a hero instead?
hi! do you work for the interastral peace corporation? or are you just dressing fancy today?
a home-use object finder? who knew the ipc made these kinds of products...
so we just had a quick chat, and i left it at that.
what i take from these stories is not so much the content itself, but what they represent in terms of the effects of time upon inazuma.
when bronya becomes the supreme guardian, do you reckon she'll let me perform at golden theater? i'll re-arrange that "supreme guardian" stage show and make it a rock 'n' roll musical!
wow, now that's what i call a pay-off.
mr svarog! are you alright? i hope topaz and her ipc henchmen didn't hurt you.
the one who left the stories of the five kasen? haha, i'm afraid you guessed wrong, paimon. it wasn't me~
if the shogun rather than i were to discover them... yes, perhaps she would have left the situation alone.
mm, you're right, we need to finish what we started... let's hurry up and find natasha.
i hear master xingqiu is writing a book? standard novella, or a ghost story? i think i should go tell him about all the things i run into -- that'd make for a really good read!
despite the similarities to the evil realm, there are no clues here...
hmm, i do have an idea... sort of. just hold your horses. let's go back and meet montana first. remember -- be nice!
the next time i encounter a situation like this, i'll be able to help...
thank you. i didn't expect our parts to wrap so quickly... i wish i could savor the experience for just a bit longer.
the exterior of the express might be melting in gastric acid... i can't even imagine what it must look like.
here's hoping the matrix is accurate, and that diviner fu won't decline our request...
i already instructed lanyang to have my outfit ready. you can fetch it from her.
ugh, can't you two humor me once in a while? i thought all that working out was finally paying off...
now's the best time to test our fireworks out, though i'm sure they'll look good whether they explode in the sky or on the ground... hehe, just kidding. i'll pay attention to safety.
it's alright, clara, no pressure. just tell us how you feel about it.
aaah! stop it!
it's not like we don't have any other suitable candidates for the position... isn't it great you can help us with such an enjoyable job?
what!? topaz!? do you know where they went?
we can't have treasure unaccounted for.
here we are. there's so many people. is everyone here for the exam?
...the votes are completely even! ugh, i don't know what to do -- both sides have really compelling arguments.
huh? geez, can you be a little more humble?
i have a feeling that with you, i can pick up the lost threads... and dispel my uncertainties.
what's wrong? if it's too much trouble, please, there's no need to force it.
oh? am i really so terrifying? well then, i'll simply have to talk to her again another time to clear things up...
it's quite similar to practicing the art of the sword. you clear your mind and focus only on what's happening in front of you.
if aventurine wants to bring down the family, he'll have to create a big enough chance. after everything he's done so far -- what is his goal...?
although the audience members might not have noticed, there were many moments where i would've been in trouble if it weren't for you by my side drawing away the opponent's attacks.
maybe if you turned that frown upside down once in a while, he might feel more at ease.
hehe. you are the most important part of the plan. i know what i'm doing. you don't think i'd leave you with no chance to win at all, do you?
we told pom-pom all about our adventure, and... they suddenly started crying... i've never seen pom-pom so sad before...
umbra headmistress, you're... destroying the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions? why?
the heater you saw is just a standard geomarrow radiator. they may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
it will still bloom at the end of the nihility, until we meet again beneath the sun's rays.
and there's the fountain that aeval mentioned earlier. it really is a magnificent sight.
gorou has a beautiful tail, don't you think? doesn't it make you want to stroke it?
however, i have visited those planets.
ahhhh, goethe hotel~ home sweet home!
looks normal enough on the surface... let's take a closer look.
the next time you're in this neck of the woods, i'll treat you to some dim sum in the city!
i see... but why aren't the other people around here scared?
anyway, when it's finished, let me know. i'll set off some fireworks to celebrate.
the sofas here all look tailor-made -- perfect for vip guests!
the kujou clan's honor was forged with courage, tempered with integrity, and shines beyond life and death
thanks for being considerate, but this is something i want to do, so it really is fine.
don't judge a book by its cover. i myself have put a few centuries behind me. would you be able to tell?
the reason being that she lost to me. and when i say "lost," that doesn't begin to do it justice. it was quite a humiliating defeat.
she chose to place her unfulfilled wishes onto the identity of tsubaki. as for me... i've already decided.
why is this guy suddenly getting all serious with kids?
you're right. children see the world as a place where anything is possible...
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine point five!
the rules i set for the shogun are... no, the shogun herself is the manifestation of my past ideals, the very foundation stone of eternity. it shall not be easily swayed.
oh yeah, there are some people we haven't said goodbye to yet!
hoo-wee! we may be new to the xianzhou, but we're already investigating the mysterious disappearance of luocha...
y'know... we're pretty good at turning a happy reunion into a tear fest. let's call it a day and give them some room.
yeah! if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
uh... i don't think we're at that stage yet. miss topaz seems like a reasonable person.
say no more. there's no doubt, it's a demonic curse alright -- and a serious one at that.
*sigh* another half day gone, and nothing to show for it...
takatsukasa... another familiar name. they have been faithfully serving the kujou clan all these years?
not bad. it would've been even better if you didn't faint. but thanks to you, the doomsday beast was as tame as a kitten. it had no temper at all.
interesting... very interesting.
haha, of course! himeko and her... collection -- more than enough reason to come visit the express.
one side will play the guardians of liyue harbor. the other side will play the fatui and osial.
your arrival is timely -- this dreamscape is fraught with danger. since our destination is the same, how about we join forces?
that's right. this is the one you helped me pick, and you said it looked kinda like me. i went to buy another one -- this one's for you.
you really want to play against me? no crying like a baby if you lose.
so, we have to connect our internal world with the external one?
are you finally going to tell us?
aiya, nothing left to do here. let's go back to wangsheng funeral parlor.
hehe... she is a member of the shuumatsuban, a genuine, bona-fide ninja.
...but i'll bring you guys some candy next time! the extra-sweet candy, the one you guys love.
oh...! ahaha, paimon you are most entertaining. thoma is first and foremost my friend, and was so before he ever became my attendant.
you're up next, little one. come on, sit yourself down here.
best future? best for who? as if you'd consider anyone but yourself.
you mean the child? she's starting to sound like a big shot.
sure, it's likely that the parents just wanted to stop the kids from staying out all the time. but they could have easily had other reasons, too.
so, i shall pray to the heavens... even if they do not respond to me. i pray that the arrows of the hunt will pierce the heart of every monster!
darn, this guy's not stupid...
if he's someone that could hold his ground in a conversation with the consultant, he needs to at least be as talented as me!
if you think you've got what it takes, then bring it on!
kind sir, look at me. now tell me, where did you hide your manuscript?
what is this? ...a brooch?
robots aligned against humans? i've never heard of such a thing. machines should obey humans unconditionally...
but i'm not sure what you want me to see. they all seem to be living... fulfilled lives.
uhh, not the most pleasant memories of that place...
master of inazuma kamisato art tachi jutsu -- kamisato ayaka, present!delighted to make your acquaintance.
today's training ends here. the qualifiers should be over now. we should go and find out what to expect in the later stages.
the puppet, yes. i've also heard that changing a puppet's operating rules is extremely difficult.
pom-pom knows how to keep people on the edge of their seats.
it's hard to imagine that the xianzhou alliance actually agreed to accommodate the ipc's request, don't you think?
my ninja arts will only send the fiendlings out of this place. but fret not, i can freely use my ninja fist!
at least, that's a romantic way of approaching this topic.
the person you speak of is sunday, my senior, and one of the local leaders of penacony. he is also the organizer of this era's charmony festival. he heard you all ran into some difficulties, and sent me here to provide aid.
ugh... but we haven't done anything wrong!
before one makes a plan, what is the most important thing one must do?
oh dear. well, that's too bad.
miss marjorie, are you in need of assistance?
i'm sure that everyone here tonight will fight by your side.
you know what? mister yang got me excited about it too... let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
hmph, i'm not hiding or backing down. you challenged me, and i'm here to accept it.
that's okay. these components are really common. maybe we can find a spare one in the ruins around here.
everyone, just calm down...
does everyone see the lanterns hanging around the venue? these have been specially prepared for the riddle game.
...all i wanted was to help jialiang find his missing wife as soon as possible, so that he could be on his way to the afterlife without any unfulfilled wishes making the journey more difficult than it needs to be...
i'll give you a hint. it's to do with the yae publishing house.
back in the day, i had to hurry home after work to do my household chores. then in the evening, it was out to the night market with the family to support our stall.
the heavier the boat, the lower the hull sits in the water. so you can tell how heavily loaded a vessel is from the height of the waterline.
oh, okay, i see. so ei's decided to palm inazuma off onto the humans, while she goes off on her own to fight a fierce battle that doesn't even have an end date...
brother... the weakness of humanity cannot be redeemed by others.
please stop looking at me with those baffled expressions. in ancient times, poetry was all the rage. but nowadays, the entertainment format of choice is light novels.
but is this nation worth existing for eternity?
this guy is really into these puppets.
he's the leader of the families of penacony, and he has the entire power of the harmony behind him... not to mention the stellaron in his possession. we must proceed with great caution.
i could have bought them back, but it's not in my nature to pay twice for the same thing. least of all when they'd be looking to make a handsome profit from my misfortune.
the moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
haha, thank you. make sure you look after me now~
generals, i am finished with my questioning.
hehe, we can even put the finished story on display at the festival.
ah, so you're seasoned crooks already, eh? don't know what i was worried about then! hehe.
i've got it! let's go to the training ground at the knights of favonius headquarters. there should be some training dummies there.
however, hoolay's demise might actually be a blessing in disguise. broadcasting this news could derail the borisin's resurgence and quash the ambitions of those who wished to take advantage of his return.
this act is named ode to prisoner. given the atmosphere here... i believe it's about penacony's past.
this doesn't seem right to me. wanna try again?
all these vested interests -- so hard to undo any of it... they don't teach this stuff in school. wait... did i even go to school?
no, i just realized that although you never talk much, you do so much for us all, quietly, in the background.
it's getting late and miss chisato and i must return now. the two of you should have a good rest for the next couple days. we'll see you on the day of the competition.
i, too have embarked on journeys, encountering "old friends" with familiar faces on different worlds, witnessing their destinies follow paths similar to mine. so, i will tell you...
is windrise... no longer popular...?
hahaha... in a way, that sort of sums up today for me. dancing like nobody's watching.
it's rare to hear such comforting words from you. i graciously accept them.
meng, are you done preparing our promotional materials?
*sigh* ...we still don't have anywhere near enough.
mister gallagher likes to keep his softer side hidden, and even though he might seem a little disorganized at times, he's always there for his friends when it matters most.
miss fu xuan, do people in memories always say weird stuff like this?
not entirely... whenever i've taken an exam in the past, i always get nervous and i can't control it.
first, tell the shrine maidens to leave the mountain.
so what we're going to do is create inazuma's newest hit novel.
plus, there is still some time to go before the exam arrives. you're the honorary knight of mondstadt, it won't do for me to take up so much of your time.
no worries, as long as we know, that's fine. we can just make them later. oh, uh -- don't forget to take the goods in when they deliver them, okay, pops?
mister giovanni is right, we got all the victory zone mastery marks... all we need to do now is wait for the final showdown!
only fifteen days? alright... fine!
that's because the great mujina youkai is extra powerful! and that's exactly why i need your help, isn't it?
i also factored in the differences between the same ingredient grown in different locations. for instance, sweet flowers from springvale are a little sweeter than those at cape oath.
if it came to it, i could always destroy another jade chamber.
huh, okay... any particular reason?
should you require a glass of hot milk or a lullaby, i will see to it without delay.
hmm, presumably the depth suggests that they were carrying something heavy.
let's get a little closer before coming to any conclusions.
lieutenant yanqing, how are you holding up?
at the very least, i should have something more than salad in store for when people come around... with any luck, i'll be able to find something to your taste here...
yes. as the silvermane guards' intelligence officer, i can't just drop my work and go travelling...
yes, i agree! as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
you have already witnessed my previous views on eternity.
the sacred sakura is within my purview at the shrine, so obviously i get to prune it exactly how i like it.
madam cocolia decided on a last-ditch offensive. she thought that if the surface fell, the underground would immediately collapse without source of supply. however, in the reverse scenario, humanity would hold out longer.
i... i didn't get a perfect score...?
phew, i do -- i never had memories to begin with.
every time i've looked forward to passing the exam, i always ended up disappointed in the end...
well, that's all the information we need.
no sweat. this is your first time in belobog -- i just want you to feel some of the warmth the city has to offer.
the steaks here are cuts of freshly shipped springvale boar. i'd recommend having it served medium to really bring out the natural sweetness of the meat.
don't worry, this place isn't dangerous. just think of this as the border of golden hour. the family is still building and remodeling the dreamscape beyond here.
i later saw you walking into the same room, so i began to connect the dots. the situation got a bit tense... i hope you don't mind that i pulled this stunt.
the architects are followers of the aeon qlipoth. it was they that foresaw the crisis, built up our walls, and established belobog -- preserving the spark of human civilization.
serval, haven't you heard? they managed to secure all four mastery marks!
oh? do you share a liking for poetry as well?
phew... i really was beaten by the best.
here. have a taste of my cooking.
you know, ei never said goodbye to me before she stepped into the plane of euthymia.
that's reality for you...
question time! so, what should you do after watching fireworks all day? hehe, the answer is... to watch them again in your dreams, of course! good night. see you tomorrow!
that's why i was sent here -- to reassure them.
you've finished already? hehe, misess imatani will be really pleased.
but i've made up my mind. so i will do what needs to be done, no matter how difficult it is.
the things we believed and the experiences we had when we were young turn into our priceless treasures as we grow up.
fyreflies are such magical creatures, aren't they? they may throw themselves at a flame or suddenly grow old, but every night before that, they will shine brighter than the stars.
a strange machine, and delirious fatui...? are you suggesting these are connected to the mirage?
thank you, although the immernachtreich really doesn't have that much of a history...
hey, these shiny things... are these light cones? i thought only the interastral peace corporation had rare stuff like this.
i have been gathering the funds necessary to build it from the time i began learning the merchant's craft. and since becoming the tianquan, i have spared no effort in hiring the best craftsmen to constantly extend it...
hey, be a bit more serious. we're live on air!
that you have piqued her interest. perhaps it's because... she has never seen an individual who is so unpredictable in the face of eternity.
i fight for the everlasting future of inazuma. however long the battle may last, it is but a drop in the ocean of eternity.
sampo... are we there yet?
thank you kindly! shall we head off, then? ogura textiles & kimonos is our first stop.
in her eyes, master masakatsu is of no threat to the decree. this is why she was so willing to allow his escape.
it's fine, i'm sturdier than i look~ besides, the ice will protect me.
...of course. i--i'm sure there's a story behind it, but that's between you and mother -- i won't pry.
don't worry, i'm a newbie swordmaster who's only been practicing the art of swordplay for half a month.
you have great taste, venti, i was right about you! let's shake hands.
hahaha, i was fishing around on your behalf through the channels that aren't accessible to you. unfortunately, i didn't find any leads worth pursuing either.
hehe, in that case, i was born ready! don't you worry!
even though i am utterly unlike makoto, and can never become the person she was, i still need to do the things that she would have done.
i'm going up against skott soon. i'm so nervous.
oh, don't worry about that. they're really nice people, i know them well. they won't cause us any issues.
these stalls look to have been quite carefully arranged.
himeko's right. as long as we can look at ourselves in the mirror and know we did the right thing, that's all that matters.
if you can get the raiden shogun to "open her heart" to you once more before the statue of the omnipresent god, you will have the opportunity you need...
if i'm not wrong, the knights of beauty also received an invitation from the watchmaker, right?
at first, i wasn't completely serious about using the opportunity to travel abroad to see a meteor shower...
i wonder whether i can still control the floating building materials in this condition...
your companionship... this is one change that i shall not contest.
finally, some peace and quiet. what are the two of you doing here?
just print it out and compete against other players -- let your aether spirits fight for your glory...
let's step back outside now. the atmosphere here is different than i'd imagined. somehow... it makes me a little reluctant to open the notebook.
claiming to have family ties with the enemy sounds to me like an attempt at asking for mercy... hoolay, are you begging me for mercy?
i will never forget you, and all that you did for inazuma.
hmm... i see. thanks for the intel, i'm sure it'll help us crack the case.
what about you, mister yang? i heard that even miss robin wasn't spared, and that guy locked you both up...
that's her! the successor to great knowledge!
are you alright, arlan? asta's been worried about you.
you'll see when the jade chamber ascends. however... it's not the most pleasant topic of conversation. maybe it's better that you don't know.
they'd also look great lined up by the window. think about it -- you wake up, and the first thing you see are these adorable critters.
um... can you please tell us where she is?
that's given me food for thought...
not so fast! last time we were here, that evil madam guardian interrupted us before we'd gotten the most out of our luxury suites... don't you think we should make up for it?
and i wouldn't worry about the continuity issue. all we have to do is explain at the beginning of the work that the protagonist can travel between different worlds. or just explain it away as a dream.
hehe, well, maybe you should be worrying less about that and more about how exactly you are going to thank me... no?
i guess... that's true.
*sigh* ...why is it always me...
you two head back to the express first. i'll pick up march and deal with the check-out procedure. oh also, miss black swan, you have a matter to discuss with me, yes?
and the one hundredth vision bearer in question... the one who will have their vision seized, i fear... is thoma.
didn't you hear him? he said he needs to take care of a few matters in the city first. if we're fast enough, we can stay out of his way.
from what i've gathered, it seems like most people in the overworld are leaning towards signing the ipc's contract.
there's no need. now shoo. get out of our way.
so the most important thing right now is to tell the conductor what we saw in penacony.
not exactly. actually, we--
i've heard that the fatui are all really scary and dangerous... you know, like the kind of people you'd want to avoid the moment you lay eyes on them.
even if life is short, memories can be eternal. as long as black swan still remembers me, the mark i leave on this world will not disappear.
wakening... which means that this so-called paradise is still a dream. stepping into this paradise means forsaking reality, correct?
hehe, by no means do we intend to place the burden of such a task on your shoulders alone.
you know as well as i do that she's always been like this. why start fretting about it now?
yes. to become fond of a place, to feel part of it... it always requires a reason.
he fell silent for a while. surprisingly, he didn't doubt the results of my divination like others had, but he looked quite perplexed.
or to put it another way, the architects are belobog's founders and saviors. even today, they are still tending to the city.
ohhhh... so that's why ms. lisa always has afternoon tea in the library... i get it now!
huh, your job sounds pretty similar to the express crew's! aside from the "business," i guess...
perhaps she felt a little intimidated by me?
don't be scared! there's a whole group of us here, and we brought lots of fireworks too. if anything, the great mujina youkai is the one that should be afraid!
huh? ever-hunt plains? uh... yeah, sure! big sis will take you there.
past the reception hall, you'll find the general hall -- the museum's largest exhibition room.
...mister yang put it nicely, but the reality is this: we sealed the stellaron, but that's not gonna solve the problems on this planet...
bronya's a good kid -- you can tell she learned a lot from cocolia. *sigh* it's been a while since we saw each other. i miss her.
especially those who came in pairs. nine times out of ten, they were here seeking to know their future fate, hoping that it would be a lifetime together.
it's kinda hard to explain...
if you got any broken equipment lying around you can always come find me, though i can't guarantee i'll be interested in fixing it.
ah, this is great! i feel so relaxed all over, i could almost float away.
some eccentric geniuses in the ranks of the fatui made adjustments to the prototype, not only unsealing his power, but very likely rendering him even more formidable than his original specifications.
...first, don't you want to know my name?
phew... i'm not very good at this kind of dance. so as long as i didn't embarrass myself, that's all that matters.
she inspires awe, commands respect, and exudes a sense of absolute authority. but as i recall, there was something else about her that struck me even more deeply...
kamisato... one of the most distinguished clans in all of inazuma. eh? that's exactly what the shogun said? well, a--ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.
the kitchen knife and spices supreme... i think i heard about that store before -- over in exalting sanctum.
a strong name! well met, baseball bat ninja!
did you organize this entire breakfast?
one of my fondest memories on the xianzhou!
hahaha, i doubt she did it on purpose!
but, speaking of your friend...
clear skies can do nothing to hide the brilliance of lightning. divine bolts can strike even in the absence of rain. do you see that tree? wait... you understand? so... demonstration is not required? good.
however, since not every family of the raiden gokaden came to ruin, such explanations were treated as nothing more than a conspiracy theory.
oh, you mean with tartaglia? nah, everything's fine. he took great care of the kids and even promised iwao he'd teach him a few moves with a sword.
and i'm sure you'll get along really well with march and dan heng.
interesting. before i decide, i'd like to know... what gave you this idea?
it is. i have greatly enjoyed experiencing the adventurer lifestyle with you.
great idea! shame we don't have any.
right? even if master yanqing says there's a mechanism in this sword that helps with cutting... can it really slice through a mech?
yes indeed. and they are some of my most reliable helpers and friends.
fungi may look adorable, but they carry potent elemental energy inside their bodies. letting one's guard down around these creatures would be an unwise move, don't you think?
it's okay, don't worry. we'll help you find her.
cocolia, you... you witch! you terminated my research and ruined my life... what else do you want to take away from me!?
i'll have a small birch sap, on the sour side.
hehe, c'mon, dad... who's never dreamed of becoming a hero?
(*sigh* fine, i'll be me. you guys will have to imagine his lines instead.)
i love the vast reaches of space, and the express does too. i want to seek out new worlds, and the express wants to return to its former path.
ha, it's you three! come on in! i was just talking to clara about you.
i know you really want to go, but we should give the youngsters a chance to get out there on their own. it'll be a good opportunity for them to bond.
well, for one thing, if you want to commemorate something, naturally you're gonna want something loud, bright, and beautiful.
the...ses? um, i don't know much about them, but they sound like something that's a cause for serious anxiety.
ooh, that's a good one, i like it!
i sensed a strong conviction and a desire for dominance in him. maybe he won't accept the outcome unless he wins fair and square.
yes, this is another case of possession -- only this time, whoever possessed him actively sought him out.
and not only do you have belobog music, but music from other planets, too...
looks like things blew up real quick... everyone's flocked here to see what's going on.
kaedehara, why did you lead us to this beach?
ahem! i--i'm not that happy. i, wh--what i mean is, uh...
if there were no injured animals, that means there was no war, which means... the world is at peace.
in which case, i think i'll take this opportunity to show you a skill that i used to be rather proud of.
this time, let's try something a little more challenging.
however, everyone in the cosmos knows of the stellaron hunters' reputation. so, why did you place so much trust in them? could it be that some of you have a connection with them?
the one that's about to begin? oh... right! i should go get help. you need to get your head checked, like, right now.
please locate her for me. it doesn't matter where she is or what she's doing. and if the ipc is still trying to take over belobog's assets, i ask that you do everything in your power to stop them.
that bad, huh? how many exhibit thieves are there...?
you go ahead, no need to worry about us.
also, if we can leverage this opportunity to establish an amicable exchange with the xianzhou alliance, it may provide us with more bargaining power when dealing with the ipc.
outsiders, seele, the second wave hasn't started yet. make the most of this opportunity and make a break for it!
traveler, paimon... it is a pleasure to finally meet you both face-to-face, hehe.
nah~ i was just imagining all the fun we're gonna have here... hee-hee!
got it! we'll get out of your way, then. bye!
hold on, i'm coming over.
i had no idea it was your fiftieth anniversary. if i'd known, i would've made some extra-fancy fireworks, just for you.
if only there was a way we could distract the guards just for long enough.
smash our rival's sales numbers and win our readers back. that is how yae miko wages war!
don't worry. it's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron.
but the more i learn, the more curious i become -- what makes you so special?
well... if that's the case, we can't let him down. we'll ask them all to help us prepare a farewell ceremony for big g.
if that's the general sentiment, then we should indeed investigate. i vote for edo star too.
general jing yuan believes in this prophecy too, as mentioned in the report. i'm curious why you didn't question it at all?
rumors? about what, exactly?
i certainly wouldn't want to end up locked away in here... let's find master masakatsu and get out of here.
yes... i will keep that in mind.
the healer does not heal himself. don't try to act tough in front of me.
an environment can't be judged purely on its size or opulence.
sorry! but you wouldn't show up if i didn't yell your name, would you?
i see... let's go somewhere else then.
...this companion of yours, blade, he'd perish too, right?
who would have guessed that there are so many mysterious women in this world, and that they would all know each other...
it's ninja initiate merchant and fiendling pest--
with a more powerful shogun, i will be able to protect you from a myriad of dangers even more effectively.
why are you two arguing again? i thought things had been improving between you lately...
for what reason has the garden of recollection chosen to work with the astral express?
according to the intel provided by my friend, the success rate for the ecological reconstruction of worlds using the ipc's technology is sixty-three%.
this hunt is finally over. thank you for holding out so long. the cloud knights are withdrawing as we speak.
yeah! it can't heal if we take out the source, right?
like those fish that shimmer like a sword blade... whoosh! oh, and those big fish that call when they see people... "woooo"!
how convenient! so next time dan heng gets lost, we can just use findie to find him, right?
of course. behind every book that hits the market lies an author, right?
if my masters are going to battle, how could they go without their disciple?
good question. what kind of a motley crew is this?
a paper flower? it's beautiful... did luocha make this?
you must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. even if you're trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. goodnight, and sweet dreams.
it was still being set up when i was there earlier, but i assume it should be ready soon.
that's mister yang -- this is child's play for him. he's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
...then good luck persuading that mass of metal.
but the shogun is still running based on her old rules. i can't allow her to make any more mistakes while i am working things out.
how may i be of assistance? ...oh, you just want to chat? okay then! well, if that's how i can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like.
salutations, master kucha. i have... deciphered the enchantment.
see you in the qualifiers. blitzara, say goodbye to our friends.
but this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
indeed. baseball bat ninja and i are comrades who will risk life and limb for one another. we were besieged in the fiendling fantasia and survived together.
oh, understood. i'll do my best!
but if i can simulate the atmosphere of an exam, then i can learn how to cope with it.
i can paint. over the next few days, i'll paint as many as i can, then we'll take those to the festival!
sounds serious. i'm all ears.
but northland bank is a special case. i rather suspect i would not be welcome there.
now, please excuse me, i have other business that demands my attention. i wish you a fun-filled festival.
then... how did they turn against each other?
"'real death' does not exist in penacony's dreamscape."
once the dreamscape is swayed, i'll complete the second step. i'll fine-tune the slumbering souls with the song of the harmony, interrupting them with the discord of "trailblaze" and guiding them towards reality.
hehe, it felt like he learned a lot from me. then again, everyone has a lot to learn from me, hee-hee~
glowswather... you mean fuli the remembrance? are they the aeon connected to my past?
hmm... dan heng, how long can humans live for?
(*sigh* true... he must've had a tougher journey than i imagined. come on, let's start over.)
you make a good point though. i should drop by more often in the future. that way, they won't get so bored.
or, to save you the trouble, i can have someone from tenshukaku deliver it directly. but of course, your name will have to be written as the sender.
then... uh, i--i'll just have some vegetarian noodles, please.
my, my! you really know what appeals to my tastes, don't you..
phew... it's not easy working at a tavern.
ahem, well... this player isn't a stranger -- we know them, too, but mister giovanni has asked us not to divulge too much information.
fate is called as such, for it cannot be changed, nor can it be reversed. it can only but be accepted.
eradicate all threats to belobog's security... that is what i must do.
yeah, perhaps. soulglad is a classic in penacony, and it'd be strange for a bar not to have it.
ugh... well, i'm sure there's nothing to see, really.
another vote for the against pile. thanks for your insight, nat.
let's give them some space to go over the good old days.
it was my mistake to make an unwarranted request without considering your own wishes.
not long ago, belobog's interstellar comms base resumed operations. a month ago, we received an invitation with a highly distorted signal...
...to sum up, traveler, since you say you know the way, we'll let you take us to the island-- i mean, the promised land.
a reward won't be necessary. i'm only acting according to my way of the ninja. riches are not what i desire.
that's right. i'm surprised you understand it so well...
the conductor wants us to attend a warp navigation meeting. same old location apparently, and we can't be late~
traveler, paimon, now that you're here, miss chisato and i can show you around the competition venue.
time to channel some rock star energy!
an astronomical amount. i don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
truth be told, i am a guest like everyone. penacony is my hometown, but i left when i was older. i was graciously invited this time to return and sing a song at the charmony festival.
the good times always pass so quickly. see you next time!
trust me, she'll hold a democratic vote. one for you, one for me, one for dan heng -- three altogether. we never go anywhere without a consensus.
hallucinations draw on people's feelings and experiences... and can come to represent what we seek the most.
it's a pity this is not the place you were expecting.
exactly! he just wants to show off, which is why he picked aurum alley as the venue.
huh? i thought you only watched documentaries.
i'm so jealous that you got a good night's sleep. i was traumatized and too scared to even close my eyes. i thought if i fell asleep, i'd never wake up again.
the planet of festivities itself... is a stellaron disaster?
ugh, no wonder the xianzhou is so scared of the abominations of abundance -- they're unstoppable!
hmm... some of these are true junk, but there are a few items of value here.
wonderful -- in fact, i was hoping to take this opportunity to show you both around. if you don't mind, of course?
thank you for the meal. i thoroughly enjoyed myself today.
their duty was to tear open a passage through space with their claws and teeth, and then call in even more powerful beasts.
rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. thunder is required.
wait a minute, now i'm a little confused. are you here to save your brother, or are you here to make your dreams of founding a martial arts school come true?
hmm, off to a most unfavorable start.
i was surprised that you didn't even tell your sister. it seems she was quite frightened, too.
but if you were to go there yourself and ask around... i think we could gather a lot of useful intel.
we must make everyone in penacony want to wake up.
great, forget memories, now everyone gets to see my imagination...
but no matter what their main priorities are, there should always be someone left at the mansion, right?
anyway, it's great to have you with us, dan heng!
there's no style in resorting to violence. it's simply the worst of all the bad decisions you could make.
three against two. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
ugh. making us run around like jerks. i bet she's loving this! i can almost hear her whispering: "come and get me..."
yeah, if that's all a villain did in an immersia, i'd definitely be asking for a refund.
...so that's why the scryglass just showed "danger" instead of "fatal danger."
is this... the stellaron imprisonment device? they had such advanced technology back in the day.... impressive.
oh, by the way -- since nobody's wishes came true on the moonless night, novels with incantations are no longer in vogue.
i'm quite sure that can't be true... i didn't do anything particularly special.
ah yes, that... nothing slips by you. to be honest, i felt a little apprehensive when i first heard that everyone wanted me to be the archon's emissary.
...how terrible of me. if i'd realized, i would've saved some pancakes for you.
even though there is still some time, if i don't make good use of it, it will disappear!
this guy looks familiar... oh! i think i saw a picture of him in the blue hour. he's a really famous director, i think.
the sole reason i held this auction is to reclaim my treasured possessions.
"the fox you gave me is very beautiful, miss shrine maiden, but i still love my old friend the most."
if you had no intention to trespass, then why did you return to the xianzhou ship before your exile was lifted?
ooh, uhh... well, if my assistance is required...
are you ready? don't shame your master now -- we're about to meet that successor.
anyway. all we need to do now is remove the curse.
eventually, i realized that the reason he was like that was that he's deaf. but i still tell him stories every day.
while you're out looking for topaz, i'll see if i can think of a strategy to deal with the situation. best of luck, and stay safe.
its original owner was an ancestor of the landau family -- rhonda landau. she was one of our great heroes who participated in the defense of belobog seven hundred years ago.
hmm... alright, i'll help you. it isn't often that i see you with such a serious look on your face. i'll tell you once i hear back from her.
back at the yashiro commission, i kept the conversation reasonably light-hearted. but now... i'd like to broach a heavier topic, if i may.
hmm, maybe. she's an important person after all -- maybe there were armed bodyguards lying in ambush.
or perhaps these mirages are a mere consequence, and not part of a process at all?
it is time we make ready our next set of plans...
breakfast sets the tone for the rest of the day. you can't compromise on it.
then, how can i ask inazuma and everyone who lives here to remain unchanging?
i think she just wants to invite you along to the island with her. that being said, i have a feeling that i'll be better off not performing any divination where that island's concerned...
if that's the case... how about we go to edo star first? if that planet really is in danger, then we should go help them out.
but, regarding the family's invitation, i do have some details that i wish to discuss with everyone... just not now. let's enjoy our vacation for now.
klee, i'm afraid it can't be helped. there are a lot of flammable items at the festival, and we have to be careful not to start a fire.
no, it's not like that! penacony is where people realize their dreams. there's always a festive atmosphere here! it's just that things can get a little crazy with the charmony festival drawing near...
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them...
come on, let's enjoy this while we can.
hmm, let me see... our next stop should be the cloudford victory zone!
if my guess is correct, that machine is capable of influencing the human brain. so we'd better tread carefully.
*sigh* aiya, aiya, no one's as considerate and kind as you are!
humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. they cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
miss topaz, if you need somewhere comfortable to stay...
well, you need to start practicing now. if my rival is as smart as i think they are, they will figure you out in a heartbeat.
*sigh* ...wait! do you mean that... roses have some meaning that i don't know about?
eight paths converge in a wood. beside them an old house is stood. if you dare to go inside, not a soul will greet your eye...
you mean, what are they made of? it's geomarrow that's undergone a change in color. the color of geomarrow is related to the environmental temperature during its refinement.
with that, our duty as nameless should be complete... right?
hey, it's fine if you don't want to talk in real life, but this is my memory, so it's my rules! come on, say something!
and finally, the last reason. does everyone remember the watchmaker? in truth, the family has poured their efforts into this festival just to commemorate this legendary luminary...
human beings don't have powers like us youkai. it's quite understandable for them to be interested in incantations to summon the supernatural.
urakusai, how much time do you have left?
every side of me is the real me. people just like to define things in all sorts of arbitrary ways.
before joining the stellaron hunters, elio told me that this journey will tell me how to live on. that's all he said. as for the rest, it's up to me to find out.
i really hope the museum can open up soon... the children here need a culturally-enriching environment -- especially those from the underworld...
the truth is that yesterday, her highness encountered the spark knight, klee outside of the city. both being of great fame, they recognized one another instantly, and began to converse.
i know i have a lot to live up to. that's why i want to become a real knight of favonius -- to help more people.
so let's wait. let's give the mirage... no, give fischl some more time.
everyone, this is captain dunn, an old friend of mine. he used to be an ace on the keys in the band.
yeah! without her, even if we'd defeated svarog, there's no way he'd have given us access to the intel, right?
really? that sounds truly terrible... maybe i can help?
but a will that cannot be eroded has no way to embrace the future.
but after my clash with human ambition, i thought long and hard. now i realize i cannot fixate on the past forever.
as guuji of the grand narukami shrine, it is my duty to seek out and master all forms of knowledge and power. only then am i capable of handling whatever phenomena come our way.
...something strange? can you share any details?
shortly after we parted ways, i felt someone's spying eyes on me. i looked in the mirror and spotted a lady wearing a black veil. we had a deep conversation, but i won't bore you with the details.
fortunately, while the path of the order governs all things, it can't affect the nihility. i came to realize this when the dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
what do you think of my dance? did you... like it?
yeah, i found those people, and it seems their wishes did come true after visiting the bonajade exchange.
if we bury it, maybe it'll spring back to life!
...just as what happened on the xianzhou yaoqing recently.
by no means. you wish to know about the stone, i presume? then let me invite the great seafarer, captain beidou, to tell the story -- if she would be so kind.
for our next stop, i'd like to take you both for a meal.
ena's dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.
he doesn't look like the type, but that sounds about right.
what deep mysteries shall we acquire knowledge of? *chuckles* i'm looking forward to it.
wait, gepard! listen to me--
yes... and even though i am just thinking through problems as i always do, i don't feel as nervous as i did when i was in mondstadt...
uh... something doesn't feel right. it's obviously an abandoned shopping street, but it also feels like people were here not too long ago...
he's clearly a born gambler if he's willing to go all in to win.
not really, no. she was a military history major -- very different from what i was doing.
you must understand the situation you are facing.
the diviner said i need to provide something from my past experiences...
an astrologist's mind is set on studying the stars. being so easily disturbed by such banal matters would hamper my judgment.
but could you try to spice it up a bit? tell it as if it were a best-seller from yae publishing house.
i know they're wary of me, but this is still an overreaction, surely...
"even so... i have to keep going. adventurers can't just give up in the face of hardship."
whew! all these b--books have got my heart racing...
ooohh! he seems to carry a valiant breeze wherever he goes... it looks like we're gonna be friends!
yeah right... anyway, since when did investigators shy away from delicate situations?
(wow, she disappeared the moment he opened the door...)
i'm sorry, seele. please protect this secret with me... till the end of our lives.
with my astrolabe, i have ascertained the trajectory of fate. next, i'll calculate the locations of the fallen meteorites for you.
no wonder wildfire and the silvermane guards were never able to find gears and wisdom...
and finally, i discovered that the traditional ways are the most reliable after all. i took inspiration from the wisdom of previous directors.
himeko, mister yang, you're here as well!
we're not to use our status or reputation in liyue harbor to our advantage, and we have no starting capital.
whew... give me a second to wrap my head around all of this...
i'd personally like to hear miss callirhoe's couplet. i'm sure i can learn something.
hmm, this bronya is... really different from the bronya i remember.
...sit up and take notice, right?
i know, right? and it really gives you a sense of accomplishment.
suffice to say, time added a whole new dimension to our search. simply establishing a location was not sufficient.
take all of our fungi and defeat her fair and square. force her to let go of her stubborn attitude and listen to the truth.
hehe... slow down, no need to rush. let me guess.
...there's no need to knock us out this time, right?
ah, my little friends, there you are.
i wonder how favonius bladework could be applied to these weapons, and what kind of modifications would be needed...
it will be easier for us to start with someone from inazuma.
i haven't been to liyue before, but from what i've heard from miss beidou, it sounds like a really interesting place.
i... admit that you are a born leader. your perspective on humanity brims with pessimism, yet you express equal compassion for all, even when your heart pities them.
don't turn around. i'm certain that you're his target. he's been on our tail since we parted ways with mister gallagher.
yes, onodera had someone from the family make it over the last few days. i heard it was based on suggestions that the spectators had written on the ballots.
hey, way to boost morale over there!
enough! from now on, no whispering allowed! if you don't want to have any homework later, you'd better start listening!
family bonds are inseparable -- no one can break them... they are the most important roots we have in this world.
i'm sure you must have some things to discuss with her, too. i wish you all the best.
ooh, wow! your first guess, and you got it absolutely...
march said something like that at first, too.
...i wish everyone could be happy, and stay on track.
that's a great story, but in the penacony cartoon, clockie and his partners have always lived in dreamville and never ventured out, right?
moving containers, picking locks... seems like we're doing all the heavy-lifting just so miss tingyun can enjoy the scenery.
our memories don't just symbolize our past. they can also shine a light on our future.
you bet i do. we go way back. he's easy to talk to. watch me persuade him.
um... well, how about this, then: i'll record this in my notebook, and we can consider it a down payment against any fireworks you want to purchase in the future.
mister giovanni? seems like my hunch was right all along...
oh! my apologies, i should stop thinking about work, this is hardly relevant to the matter at hand. this store here is the place i wanted to visit.
why does the prinzessin enjoy the theater so much?
*sigh* if we didn't do anything to help, i wouldn't be able to watch a meteor shower, even if it appeared right now.
even though i've already worked for the knights as a maid for some time, i still need to pass this exam to officially become a knight.
*sigh* it seems that even basic astrology can't be grasped in one go.
by the way, i imagine adventurers' guild members are good at making order of things?
don't ask, just follow my lead!
thank you so much, both of you. i'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
meaning... you're here for some other reason, right? how might i be of assistance?
hmm? is there something else you need to take care of? how about i take the fan back, then?
in there lurks a secret called "device ix"... one day, i'll reach it.
well, i'm done eating. we should get ready, then head off to liuli pavilion.
miko... a few days ago, some strange paper notes flew into tenshukaku, demanding that i "hand over the dog"... so i am here to see what on earth it was all about.
ah, looks like i'm the one who got distracted.
seriously, these financially fortunate types are starting to get on my nerves...
i did originally think of steering clear of all this, but i couldn't. even if this is all futile, i still wish to help everyone. if we don't struggle to the last, then how can we face the end when it comes?
look at the deer's feet -- there are more roots coming up!
the first stop most people head to as soon as they arrive in the dreamscape is the oti mall! the dreamscape sales store here is super famous.
...of course! this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity -- i can't miss it.
naturally, for anyone looking to make a profit in a complex market, the bottom line is having the requisite experience and expertise. all i can do for them is share whatever insight i may have.
and speaking of formal tone... what is the deal with that girl, fischl? she's a curious one.
it's fine! you really don't have to apologize. we're just passing through, it's no big deal.
but the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... the music it played had off-key notes in the background.
correct. and it's different from the underground towns you described. the fragmentum there has quite literally torn everything to pieces -- there's no sign of life, despite the monsters.
the sights here are nothing like what i've seen at home. there are new wonders to be found with each step.
leave it here, and i shall sample it.
what people truly fear about departing this world is suffering and regret. to deal with the trauma, they let their imaginations run wild with notions of ghosts and evil spirits.
you're so lucky... i'd travel all across the world too if i had the chance. i want to see all that there is to see and make friends with all kinds of people... i would even go on adventures with them, just like you do...
i saw the game was called "akitsu yuugei." i'm guessing it originated from "akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura." the thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
there are no monsters, nor is there anything else here that could threaten your life.
ugh... let's just pretend i never said anything. as long as one of us is making an effort.
hehe, that's a normal reaction for first-time visitors to the dreamscape.
my, my, who have we here?
for many people, mother was an outstanding guardian... the whole truth will live on in my mind -- all the mistakes, madness, evil, and dreams therein... i will be the one to carry that burden.
aha! so, you're trying to learn how to reject herta, and then put it into practice!
speaking of champions -- have you heard the story of the mysterious "elite player?"
so... you think svarog's logic has a hole in it?
one hundred push-ups, one hundred sit-ups, one hundred squats...
we're drawing closer to the truth once more. let's give misha some time, as i believe he'll unveil the secret of this dream bubble.
well then, we shall oblige.
people are pouring in! kinda feels like all sorts of baddies are showing up. let's get in there quickly and enter the competition!
well, that's settled then~ okay, let's play... huh?
don't blame me, this was your general's idea. when he learned that you gave up being the ringmaster to join my wolf hunt team, he insisted that i hide the plan from you. perhaps he thought your impatience would mess things up.
these people... they send me the most extravagant gifts...
there's something else i wanted to tell you. i tried performing a divination again on the beach.
*sigh* looking at how rash she is, i worry for the box...
my mother mentioned in her notebook that tsubaki enjoys food from all over the world.
you've helped me many times before, and you've always lent me your ear when i speak about my troubles. but if i'm always turning to you for help, it almost feels like you're somehow besting me.
never imagined that's how we'd end up getting past the guard... that trick of clockie's really is amazing.
ah, it looks like he's at the broken sea. there's a big group of people with him, too.
*sigh* it feels nice to get tingyun's gifts to the right people.
in my opinion, there are many people around with ulterior motives, making this a very risky business to enter into in the short term.
let's go, i'll take you to the safe zone~
but after the momentary numbness subsided, i found that my body was absolutely unscathed.
this way... is blocked as well.
alright, alright, calm down. she'll be able to look after herself.
in the end, we still failed to figure out his true identity, or if he was even a "living person."
so. the goal here is to get all the sleepers to wake up. am i right?
ugh, come on, stop fooling around.
in addition to her secretarial duties, eris is also a student at the belobog college of art. she's very knowledgeable about the museum's exhibits and their history.
#what do you think, {nickname}? is this atmosphere putting you in a lazy mood too?
hmm... for instance, ingredients approaching their expiration date can be used to create very cost-effective meals as long as you thoroughly cook them with the appropriate cooking methods.
even if you can't find it right now, it'll definitely show up before the fireworks show starts. so remember to come and pick up your weapons from me before then, okay?
okay, okay, i promise this is the last time.
ah, speaking of which, miss eris was just looking for you -- why don't you go to the museum and talk to her?
a little get-together between friends, sipping the finest tea, and watching lanterns float into the sky. bidding farewell to the past, and embracing the present with joy.
it seems that sayu is almost always sleepy and in need of a good nap. to see her here accompanying you and addressing these matters goes to show how much effort she is expending on your behalf.
wait a minute... is this what you wanted me to see?
th--that shouldn't be a problem. i have some savings left...
no! that end won't come to pass while we're around!
sure enough, no one knows about miss robin. i'm not surprised.
this is the largest park in golden hour -- it represents the soda culture of penacony. that gigantic soda bottle houses the headquarters of the soulglad enterprise!
when we were at mingxing jewelry, i admitted that my decision to sacrifice the jade chamber was a calculated one. i had already considered what i stood to lose and to gain.
as a fox envoy, i have an excellent memory. i recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
i know you're excited, so feel free to have a look around and talk amongst yourselves. soon, you'll find out there's nothing special about this place.
it was already getting dark, so in that spirit of great compassion and care for which she is known, her highness personally accompanied klee back to mondstadt.
it was a twist of fate that made him leave wuwang hill in the first place. now, for some reason, he can't go back.
evening, jessie! uhm... is it evening?
huh... fancy running into you guys at a place like this. what are the chances!
we should look for a new investment. mora doesn't grow on trees.
not to brag, but our consultant truly is impressive. his knowledge extends across the stars and the land, and there's nothing throughout history that he doesn't know.
in this universe, there exist countless worlds that are similar yet different, and countless people who are alike yet distinct.
alright. well, best of luck with your investigation then. thanks again for bringing the bonus, charlotte. do give my regards to the chief editor.
you really don't have to. i'd like to hang out on my own. bye!
general jing yuan, general huaiyan, it's just as we suspected... the rise of the ambrosial arbor was not the end of things, but the beginning.
besides, investigating any strange occurrences near mondstadt and making a report to the knights of favonius is also part of our job.
you don't seem to worry too much about the xianzhou, miss tingyun.
...oh, don't cry! uh -- listen, these parts don't belong to mister svarog, but... you two were still a big help to us!
...when we set foot in this picture-perfect place, i never would've imagined we'd be dealing with such a mystifying occurrence.
i'm also hoping sakujirou won't have to use it. it's just there as a last resort.
so, you seem to be under the impression that i am able to offer some sort of help? who gave you that idea?
no matter how hard i train, i can never pass the selection trials.
we, the people of liyue were indeed prosperous. but blinded by our prosperity, we forgot that time can be pitiless.
the work we put in to survive may seem small in the grand scheme of things... but that doesn't mean it's not important.
he didn't? that doesn't sound like the divine foresight i know.
no worri-- oh wait, actually... ahh, yeah, that could be a problem... some worries.
but we can't lose our momentum, master yunli!
don't be fooled by its appearance. about twenty% of our silvermane guard fragmentum losses are a result of chasing this creature.
these guys are my assistants. we need to overhaul all the installations here.
seems like someone wasn't paying attention!
shhhh, keep it down! we don't want to draw any unwanted attention.
considering even their visions have been taken from them and embedded in the statue, they are ultimately quite helpless.
for real? hmph, never mind the gift i got for you then...
we can't get through here. let's take the way around from the side.
my period of solitude will now continue, but it will not last too much longer. i will leave you humans to deal with any minor issues in the meantime.
of course i don't. there is no need for commerce in the plane of euthymia. if i ever need something, i can simply have one of the commissions bring it to me.
so you're not the guide mister oleg was talking about, seele?
my long hours of training have finally paid off. this is dazzling palm.
we can get to the rooftop of the opposite building from here, but it requires a device. i remember it's hidden here...
gotta start somewhere. oh, by the way, did you guys learn anything about the meteor shower?
mm... too late, the moment's gone!
right! the guide says we should find a flat, dry, sheltered location -- facing the sun at high elevation...
ahem! sorry... heh, friends' habits rub off on you when you spend a lot of time together, don't they... haha... hah...
knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. i should be thanking him.
hold your horses, both of you. there's no need to creep each other out.
it was so easy for you to just leave this world behind... don't you at least owe me an explanation!?
it was one of the oldest and most precious items in the general hall collection -- the meteor fragment.
don't worry too much about the material. if you think it'll be difficult to obtain, we can get it for you.
holding a cultural convention featuring light novels!
no, surely you can't be serious! how can i compare to master jean...?
i did have my mind set on not letting henning get hurt...
you possess great cunning. deliberately setting us up to be on opposing sides, constantly repeating the words of the emanator in front of others, leaving me no choice but to draw my blade against you.
climb the mountain? to the summit?
hmm... i give it a nine point eight!
yes... looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
in business, everything comes down to profits versus losses. you have to keep a cool head and make rational judgments. in other words, you must be shrewd.
yes, just in case anything untoward happens. i can take care of it myself.
you've never really seen us as outsiders, huh.
besides, i genuinely like the job of an intelligence officer -- for me, using my brain is a lot more fun than traveling.
well, i was sure worried about her... after she disappeared, pela's workload doubled -- she said she barely had time to go out.
she sure did put a lot of work into this gag, and i think we're the punchline.
hahaha, alright, i won't bother you guys any longer. remember to come and watch the fireworks!
huh? are we going? what about miss fu xuan?
master diviner? can you hear me? darn it... something must have gone wrong!
there are no perfect legends, and no heroes that can save everyone. instead of dwelling on my helplessness, what i should do...
don't push yourself too hard! just leave if you can't handle it!
so mister giovanni really is a member of the masked fools? no wonder...
with that extraordinary demeanor and literary talent, he's definitely not just any bard.
as plans go, changing the deity's mind is a huge gamble to begin with. we can't expect to be in control of every last detail when we're facing off against a god, can we?
i don't think he has quite grasped the nature of this situation.
...wait, are you for real?
the problem we are facing right now is that master masakatsu, who was providing us with counterfeit visions, has recently been arrested by the tenryou commission.
huh, how strange... back in mondstadt, i never feel shy around strangers, but over here i feel so tense...
...you really are quite different from the rest.
shortly after we parted ways, i met a lady wearing a black veil who was also a guest at the hotel. we had a good time talking about the event over drinks.
be careful though. don't get fooled by her again.
there's a lot of foot traffic here, but if you look closely, you'll see only a handful of people have been watching us constantly.
thank you for your thoughts, mister oleg. another vote for the "for" pile.
hehe... i've always wanted to say something like that. did it sound strange?
so, pitch-dark hook the great, you can tell us now, right?
i'm planning to make a new set with the board and pieces based on the battle for liyue.
absolutely. she is strict with both herself and others, to the point that she can even become overly involved at times. she's worked several days without a break now.
hmm... probably a scene from ancient inazuma.
no. someone i've never met before. today's lunch will be our first time meeting each other.
i don't see a switch for the gate.
we've been so busy running around in circles, we haven't gotten the chance to say goodbye to friends we've just met -- i feel like parting is still such sweet sorrow.
you feeling any better? i know that must've been really scary for you.
oh, i see. that means you, my friend, must have guessed that i was trying to promote my business to miss furina.
pretty simple... i just hope these tests don't take too long.
it's no use, seele. she's made up her mind. i could tell from her expression.
fireworks were originally developed alongside many other inventions here in liyue.
haha, as usual, my predictions are correct.
hehe, that sure is reassuring!
...oh, no need? i should take a break...?
i'm wondering though, are there any restrictions against, uh... "aliens" like me from boarding the train?
and there he goes again... i just wonder how much of what he says is true.
my existence, hmm...
this fiendling assumes the form of an insect-like pest. clearly a lowly fiendling.
there's no mistaking it... this component was taken from gears and wisdom!
but being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. we must make a decision, no matter what.
a castle showdown looms ahead of us, fellow ninjas. we ought to make haste with ninja speed.
alright, never mind. so how about what they said -- do you remember their exact words?
it's okay, don't be discouraged. hey, remember, if you wanna be a hero, you gotta have patience -- and wisdom, too.
i was at a loss for words when i started reading the contents of the notebook... it almost felt like... like someone had looked inside my mind, examined my thoughts, and then written them all down on paper...
after the decision is made, if you could please shred any documentation that accumulates on the wall during the process.
the traveler is a national hero in liyue whose actions have directly contributed toward the prosperity we enjoy today.
when you travel with mister yang, he'll give you a thesis on everything he sees -- if you have the patience to let him go on and on.
o--okay then. it seems you are in great need of assistance...
ah! i remember now! the general wasn't there when we broke into the alchemy commission. looks like we've found the source of our distortion.
yes, there's no need to become someone else, nor worry about failing... as long as i perform better in my next exam than in my previous one...
the atmosphere here is so different now... it's so lively!
that's the enemy attack alarm... every silvermane guard in the reserve zone just became our enemy.
you must be tired after a hard day's work. i'll brew you some tea and prepare your favorite snacks. please rest well.
it all happened so suddenly... but looking back, i think mister yang was right. tingyun was behaving strangely -- she was fascinated with the abundance's creations.
such lively activities stand in direct contrast to the notion of eternity. i'm afraid i'll have to consider it further.
...you're telling me off again. fine, whatever bro. you better be going, come listen to pela and my next rehearsal.
haha. i know what's going on, then.
i know it's tough to believe all this without reservations. i just want to say you're very close to the final answer -- just one more thing needs to be done, and then i can prove it to you...
okay, i understand. i'll find a way to bring her around.
while i want to live, i'm never afraid of death. the opposite of death is eternal life, and that's... something i'll never desire.
mm-hmm! so, you are gonna let us in now? we need to talk to mister norbert about some important business-related matters.
i'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. and as a silvermane guard, i have a lot that i need to ascertain. nothing more.
from my point of view, it doesn't seem like he's just pretending to be nice. i think the kids would agree -- they believe he's a kind, reliable grown-up.
but that miss firefly is truly mysterious. there's no information on her in the hotel system. even if she's a stowaway... she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
by neither saying goodbye nor seeing me again, our relationship will remain forever how it was... in her mind, at least.
do you have to make it sound all scary...?
...not much, but i didn't bring my coin purse.
you know what? he's got me excited too... let's find a time to head into the northern valleys and check it out!
that lines up with what we've gathered so far. firefly got involved in this mess because of the legacy... and now we're sure that aventurine's accusations against acheron are baseless.
drinking this stuff can't lead to anything good. that's for sure...
by the way, do you know that clockie's design is said to be inspired by none other than the legendary watchmaker?
yes, deep down, people everywhere are the same...
great! then let me give you a demonstration first.
last time we took a walk around inazuma together, i witnessed the way the world is today. i was finally able to comprehend some things that i had never understood in the past.
i didn't expect her to be so open-minded... and she didn't even try to persuade me to stay. she didn't summon me just to return the guitar, did she?
the meteor fragment... it's so majestic...
...i had surmised as much. i knew you wouldn't have avoided mentioning the bird for no reason.
as for me, i'm just here to have fun and treat everyone to something good!
let me think... can you recommend anything that, um... goes well with a drink?
oh? seems you haven't seen his other side...
did you come to a conclusion with the ministers? it's so loud i can't tell what anyone's saying...
...fool you what now? ugh, stop it, i'm getting fu xuan vibes.
but i believe that surely you understand what they must endure.
could it have something to do with... that clockie that only you can see?
keqing has taken an unusually keen interest in this giant stone, which is why we are leaving the matter in her capable hands.
she must have realized something about you... something i haven't yet been able to perceive for myself, and it bothers me...
there's something you should know. we were able to locate you within this boundless dream and find the key to breaking free from the dream, all because of one person's unwavering dedication...
get up when you feel better. himeko wants you to go find her. i have something to do, so i won't go with you, alright?
we both still have our own paths to walk. so let's forge ahead. hopefully, if we meet again... it'll be beneath clear skies.
it looks like the situation is more serious than i thought.
you agree, right? i mean, who wouldn't want to be a swordmaster?
however, the almighty shogun was far more powerful than any human being. in a direct confrontation, the duel would be over in an instant.
you've known me for some time now... i think you understand my personality, don't you?
true happiness and the meaning of life lie in defying the nihility and embracing all that life offers!
we can start with people we already know. i remember lots of folks like to relax around the plaza. let's head there first.
sure, do what you need to. come back when you're ready.
if you need anything, i'll make time for you. call me if there is something you can't resolve.
with their stronghold exposed, i doubt the balladeer is stubborn enough to try and retaliate now on his colleagues' behalf. it would be more trouble than it's worth.
i hope the name, ningguang, will live on, but not as a person. as more of a symbol.
yes... it is a fortress-like financial city, the economic heart of the dreamscape. the pepeshi people of the alfalfa family are there to keep it running, sending blood that is made from money everywhere on penacony.
miss black swan's strategies and methods are as thorough and enchanting as her dancing. i look forward to the moment when we can dance together.
i also enjoyed aeval's introductions to fontaine along the way. everything you described was so clear and detailed that we can't help but want to hear more.
glad to hear that. after all, you just did me a huge favor!
boarding exam? like a test? i can do that! that sounds like the admission system that schools in belobog use!
...people with big dreams have big determination.
really? even the honorary knight?
hehe, please just disregard my presence. now, tell us what you discussed.
mister aventurine and miss topaz are here too... and, who is that over there?
um... it's a little bitter... and a little sour...
if our true motives were ever divulged, she would act against us without a second thought.
that's alright. take your time to contemplate this moment. once you feel ready, let's step onto the final stage.
stellarons bring about different disasters on different worlds. but every world seeded with a stellaron will give birth to fragmentums.
speaking of living in the shadows, there's probably not much difference between us. it's only polite to reveal your true self, at least when speaking to others...
"stairs made of coins can lead to happiness." does this mean we can take it? i'm not sure if it's a good deal... but thank you anyway!
all the stars are in their rightful place.
to put it nicely, even deities indulge in wishful thinking. to put it more bluntly, there are things that even the seven can't do when faced with something even more powerful than themselves.
a sea of ashes... a windless land... what could it be...?
hehe, good. saves me from having to explain everything again.
can't wait to find out what's inside these victory zones!
suspects!? that's not good...
i understand why you wanted me to "know myself and know my enemy." i don't feel as nervous as i did before!
watching a theater performance in a nation like this must be quite an experience.
does it mean that a monster appeared over at the workshop? clara, she...
you don't "protect" people by imprisoning them.
i know this is a lot to ask out of the blue, so apologies in advance.
we take tea breaks together sometimes. often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. i'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... but i still love spending time with barbara.
hehe, well, now you know: the wangsheng funeral parlor is a great location! all of you are always welcome to come and hang out here, especially if you're in the mood to try something new!
so... maybe the finch took the monocle back to its nest?
...hmm, it seems like the evil presence is gone after all. you really did manage to suppress it, huh...
the exterior is spacious and very pleasant, and the interior is exquisitely decorated.
hmm... you're right, mister yang. guess i can't compete with the angler just yet...
...i don't know how to offer words of comfort, nor do i know much about curing others' ailments.
unable to cope with the tremendous pressure he was under, he suffered a spiritual collapse. with his wits impaired, he finally descended into madness.
casual... how about this? this feels quite natural.
i won't go too far, and don't worry about me getting bored. i'm an expert at finding ways to pass time!
miko, come on... no need to put them on the spot like that.
hehe... i assume you're hoping to take back a few moves.
...thank you so much, i will study it very carefully and try my best to do it justice.
heyo, looks like everyone's about done mingling and riddling! gather round, and look this way!
we can use the building materials that are floating around in the air.
and this only makes me all the more excited to meet with them.
this must be... when the crew first found me? i don't remember a thing.
um... i didn't understand a word of what you just said.
i am on a mission from my master to retrieve a certain box from mondstadt.
...my answer might not be able to resolve your confusion, because it has been with you throughout your journey, and is already a part of your life.
whenever someone approaches, a spirit will -- pow -- leap out and pull that unfortunate person inside the shrine, using the victim to replace themself as the prisoner!
what is... umbra headmistress talking about?
i'm fine, seriously. really! i...
first, look at those two sky-faring commission staff members. they've been observing us in secret since we arrived here.
no worries. and don't miss out on the start of the fireworks show.
kujou sara of the tenryou commission is... not known to smile, and i have had my fair share of disputes with her. she is, however, a loyal servant to inazuma, there is no question about that.
this palace floats in the skies, higher than the peak of any mountain. from this vantage point, one may survey all of liyue.
well, would you like to participate this time? you don't have to bid, of course. just experience the atmosphere.
no worries. you can buy me a meal next time!
but if you like, i could give you all a small private show any time.
there's an old saying among the borisin: "in the forest, the hunter may easily become the hunted." while we may call ourselves the hunters now, chasing them blindly will only make us become the prey.
still... there is one other thing on this topic that i suspect you may be curious to know.
well... technically we didn't find all the parts, and if we called in the experts to put it back together, they would have realized...
yeah. if we hadn't seen those wood carvings, then we wouldn't have dreamed of such cute aranara.
i wasn't certain whether it was true, so i came right here. the fact that he hasn't arrived here as we arranged suggests that it is true.
the pictures of these wigs look good, but the names are a bit hard to understand, like this one called "black long straight" and this one called "motherly blue."
such a tyrannical rendition of the mantra of the ninja, baseball bat ninja!
great! everyone's just as heroic as when they arrived. so, what's the master plan, general?
there's no need to be quite so modest. actually, you were the first person i thought of. i place a great deal of trust in you. besides, we haven't thought of any other suitable candidates.
yeah! fyi, we're pretty awesome.
so why were you hiding from the silvermane guards?
the palm... why... used on me...?
hmm, in that case, head back to the inn and capture your nervous breakdown in writing while it's still fresh. this'll make excellent source material, too.
...hey, get outta there or you'll shiver to death.
so how much for these desserts?
how could you say that! don't be so mean. and while you're here, why don't you help me comfort pom-pom!
look, bronya and cocolia's echoes... they must have come through here.
all things are impermanent, this departure may be our final farewell. may your way of the ninja be ever courageous and enduring. until we meet again!
yep, that's her. what's the matter?
...how old are you now, mister officer?
well, i have some business to attend to here, so i booked a hotel in the city. i was just out for a stroll... when i bumped into you. quite unexpectedly, if i might add.
you needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. leave them to beidou -- she is well versed in handling treasure hoarders. i will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
oh ho, but my dear dear paimon, it seems you are not yet aware. that was not for my own sake, but for a special guest who is joining us today--
speaking of stories, you've reminded me that now is not the time for them. moze, we've sent the "warning" from stargazer navalia. what's the situation on your end?
such is the very essence of trailblazing. it is through these trials that we find wisdom and maturity.
no, it won't. i've made sure to allocate time for training too -- after all, combat is also assessed as part of the examination... ohh...
perhaps... you are right.
is he your leader? i feel he possesses a great stillness of mind in everything he does.
i'm good. let's do this.
hehe, brother always works diligently, and it's rare for him to ever put his duties to the side and relax.
i did everything according to the guide, but the tent's still wobbly...
friends look after each other, the same goes for us nameless. please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the express will always be behind you.
i know, right? isn't he adorable?
i still remember the question on the invitation letter -- why does life slumber?
i know it sounds absurd, but there's actually something behind this, i promise.
let's act natural, determine who our tail is, then lure them somewhere more deserted, so we can catch them.
ready? i'm gonna start my reconstruction.
will you stand with us as we reestablish our contracts -- as we build a new age of prosperity?
is that so... you're good then. what sort of training did you have to undergo? can you teach me?
ohhh... no wonder he left his post for so long that day.
...copycatitis still has no cure i see.
oh, i could hear you. i just have a habit of being silent while i'm watching fireworks.
she says what she thinks -- i like her. and did you hear what she said about the silvermane guards? haha, sounded like she'd been waiting a long time to say it. i think i'd get along with her.
hehe, it would be rather boring if i had arranged every last detail in advance. the chance encounter between you and haniyyah came as quite a pleasant surprise.
it appears that captain kaeya's way with words does not come the most naturally to me...
no wonder he didn't mention the elixir back then. hmph, i thought he was being frank and transparent with me for once, but apparently not...
this puppet isn't responding at all... did something go wrong?
i didn't expect to meet a fan here. i'm honored. welcome to penacony, a world filled with wonderful dreams.
i can't be certain. it may be a masked fool's trap. from the execution itself, the riddlers or inquisition spirits could have done this themselves.
anyway, as long as you're all right. i should return to my room too.
oh, you're right! that wasn't there when we arrived!
no need for that! the teams are just a formality. we're all friends here, and this isn't intended to be competitive. but what do you think, judge zhongli?
but ninja gama, why are you bogged down by inaction when you've long realized the truth behind their pretense?
well... okay then, if it's just providing some initial source material...
i... i just feel... i shouldn't let such things distract me from my chivalric training!
the less fragmentum corrosion there is, the safer it gets!
oh! if you're peckish, just let me know. i can whip something up for you right away!
i'd say it's a solid five stars.
just give me a sec! i'll play with you once i'm done.
but these problems disappeared all but completely after the battle against osial.
it's a pleasure to journey alongside you once more. it's time i laid bare the entire truth before you. as you might have heard... i also go by another name: stellaron hunter, sam.
the spirit of rock 'n' roll? so, what does it mean? what does it mean for rock music to have a "spirit"?
xiao, you're an adeptus! do you think it might be possible?
as for the puzzle i'm working on... i should have an answer soon.
i woke up for the same reason as all of you. in the dream, i experienced something that could never occur in reality...
ah, right. you've got such a large piece of paradise here. do you have any plans for it, you know, besides just living here?
look at the decor here... it's like the inside of a grand mansion. i don't think this is a perilous maze -- it's somebody's home.
(what's going on here? why are the traveler and paimon frantically winking at me?)
after he got drunk, i carried mister bruce back to the knights of favonius headquarters myself...
...is a stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
but there's also an added layer of significance to it, because this place belongs to you.
who's there? didn't your parents tell you to knock before--
fireflies and butterflies often fly to me, but spiders and cockroaches come too... that's why i prefer cold places. but when the temperature drops, i also don't want to move. what a dilemma...
well, i guess we'll have to save you then.
so, you pursue distinction in the martial arts? clearly, the musou no hitotachi has sharpened your resolve.
ah, there you are. let me introduce the team:
...i'm just thinking, these must be the things that we aspire to.
seems like the first day of our trailblazing expeditions is always pretty eventful, huh dan heng.
okay, okay, that's enough of that. let's go and find julian.
"a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is the hottest light novel right now. if we did as you suggested, we would effectively be advertising to everyone that the incantations are real.
how about i ask her to come over? or maybe we go straight to her teahouse?
hey there. tired? how about a coffee?
don't forget, move well away from it after you light the fuse, and try to avoid burning your clothes. also, it's best that you cover your ears...
in any case, since you remember what happened just now... well, that's put my mind at ease.
looks like your mind's still in one piece, if you're able to remember such details... well that's reassuring.
yes. she went to khaenri'ah alone, without telling me.
no~ please don't make fun of me.
was the seer strategist thinking of us, or thinking of the fates we're destined for?
might i ask if you fear severing these bonds with your own hands?
what's gotten into you? come on, sit yourselves down.
honestly, when i heard the conductor's request, i was pretty surprised.
but even so, they are due a resolution... i owe it to them and to all the people who have placed their faith in me to date.
it's eerie how quiet it is here... it's kinda creepy...
within them, we glimpse our own essence, and thus... we truly "exist."
everyone has their own unspeakable past, secrets that they don't want to be revealed... and i won't be asking any more questions, such as why the astral express is roaming around the cosmos with a stellaron on board.
pela's got a lot on her plate -- plus she also does volunteer work on the weekends sometimes. that's why we usually schedule mechanical fever's rehearsals at night.
a bird with sharp edges and points... umm, i don't think i saw it.
ohh~ is seele starting to appreciate our strength? hmm?
i had no idea things were like this. here i was thinking the ipc had come to rebuild belobog, not extort it!
but unlike you -- i live for the "self". from my perspective, individuals making choices for themselves is their birthright.
oh? you recognized me right away. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
for instance, it was certainly a pleasant surprise for me today to meet top talents from all around teyvat.
by the way, does captain beidou play genius invokation tcg, by any chance?
oho, well aren't you a sight for sore eyes! seems like our luck just keeps on growing!
a little dusty... best give it a spring-cleaning!
i'm really sorry for waiting until now to tell you everything.
since we are both here for the same reason, let us work together.
silly-churl, billy-churl, silly-billy hilichurl. frilly-churl, willy-churl, frilly-willy hilichurl ah, hehe...
check the coach and see if there is anything out of the ordinary.
kouichi! i'm here, how is the boat coming along?
the atmosphere here... looks similar to sunday's inner world. perhaps this so-called "stage play" is created with his abilities.
it's fine! you've thanked us more than enough already.
so, we're about to hold a democratic vote on whether to set a course for the xianzhou. all those in favor, hold out your hand. all those against, keep your arms by your side.
meng and i will escort big g back to wuwang hill. you meet with those three and ask them for keepsakes to symbolize each one of them during the ritual, then come and find us.
your good intentions are commendable, just like the cloud knights' determination to eliminate those abominations. even though there are always people who remain skeptical, i won't question your motives.
a philosophical mind... i hope i'm not intruding.
i'm sorry, i have something important to do right now. i'll be back later on.
galaxy ranger... his affiliation with the organization is merely a cover. it's evident that he lives only for himself, and that is exactly why i have faith in him.
i would ask -- would you still embark on this journey?
hang on, i'm still struggling to understand this. i need you to explain it again...
i just have a few minor things i need to attend to. i won't be long.
so now, i go from door to door, looking for people and organizations willing to cooperate. just like during our visit to the adventurers' guild! that's what i mean by "business development."
no need. there's no place for such things in my life.
hello there! did a child in a wheelchair pass this way?
but how about you? would you be interested in visiting inazuma?
to be frank, i'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural... i often worry that i haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
ice-capped mountain? is that all?
what? does he look like a crane to you?
that's right, be confident in your work. that's exactly how a light novelist should be.
hmm... the way we're wording this lacks... warmth and sincerity.
there's a pleasant breeze and glorious sunshine... so, where shall we go for a walk?
i saw the conductor watering the bonsai earlier. do they really like plants? i'll ask the butler to help send over some of penacony's unique flora as soon as possible.
the emotionless, soulless, and merciless evil ninja osaru.
why isn't svarog helping you?
it's done! it came out great -- you're very photogenic.
hello everyone, i'm firefly. mm... i am also an ordinary girl who enjoys adventures.
oh, and also, you're technically my customers now. here, this is your paper slip. if you ever wanna see that golden firework again, just come and see me.
next time i visit the express, i'll definitely bring her some belobog specialties in return.
well, what do you think? is inazuman cuisine to your liking?
this is what i've seen and heard along the way...
besides, i'm a researcher... how could i not get excited about the chance to explore new worlds up close? everyone gets tired of living in small places like belobog after a few years, right?
seems like he's taking this winning and losing thing a little too seriously... well, at least we finally get to go through...
but at least head down and take a look first? it's right by the inn, and there's plenty of fun activities to get involved with. it can't hurt to take a quick walk and check things out.
i've always found it hard to handle complex relationships... be it cocolia or my family.
ahhhh. it feels like it's been a long time since i've gotten so physical.
there's so much pressure, my stomach is really hurting. maybe... i should just drop out of the contest?
she takes the "wrong path" because, in her eyes, it is the most effective and sensible method of achieving her goal.
excellent work. you've figured it all out.
it sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. but it won't end there. they are not the type to forgive and forget.
let's move on to the next stop... uh, i mean-- the last stop. let's go!
*blowing* ...liyue's tea is certainly different from that of mondstadt.
he seeks an ending through "death" while i seek an opportunity for "life." though we walk on opposite paths, we will reach the same destination, and he... will not become destiny's slave.
do you actually believe in the stellaron hunters' prophecy?
hmm... i'll go and ask. whatever happens, i at least need to go inside, just this once. hm!
if that's the case, then that's even more reason not to be flippant about it.
hiding the exuvia was a necessary maneuver to take the initiative back, to play the spider while our foes scurry about.
so. from what you were saying, it seems that she has finally begun to comprehend what form eternity should take?
yes, i suggested to yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. a hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."
you don't understand. the one preventing us from getting close to the truth... is cocolia herself.
perhaps this does not result in what you might call a fair price. but what it does do is identify the person who values the item the most.
as i suspected, the core of this issue lies within... the stellaron.
it's completely blocked by the mine cart... what do we do? can we blow it up?
okay, you won. go on, you can put on that smug face now.
on occasion. usually, everyone is too busy for a leisurely sit-down meal. there is an awful lot to get done most of the time.
the path ends here. for the rest of the way, we need to borrow the dreamweaver's tools.
sure, it won't take us a moment.
...perhaps your feedback will also deepen my understanding of the tea ceremony.
anyway. be gone. do not disturb my solitude.
how are you feeling? did the curse leave your body?
what i mean is, i often used to find odds and ends while performing my cleaning duties.
collecting rare and exquisite treasures... yes, this seems suitably sophisticated.
huh? me again? it hurts, y'know!
but no... the more i think about it, it can't possibly be that simple.
hello, morihiko. how's business these days?
very humorous.
well, no worries, if that's the case then never mind.
all i know is that it's the foundation of the sacred sakura, and from what i have heard it's a little different from ei's "plane of euthymia."
it's times like these that a leader must stand up and do what's needed...
you okay there? what's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
descendant of the takatsukasa clan. explain what is going on here.
seals? oh, the grafitti the student from the disciplinary committee was talking about.
in his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. that would be the best place for him to go. so that will also be our final battlefield.
you should cherish every light cone. they are all precious memories of their original owners.
let's hurry up and get out of here. i'll explain later.
hey, i'm not that heartless y'know...
...suspicious components? can we have a look at them?
let me guess -- time, space... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
i don't need you to remind me, and i didn't have every confidence that i was doing the right thing. but the sense of duty to carry out an order is bound to prevail with me.
so that's why you went for maintenance, way to go serval! i thought you just came up with it on the spot.
mm... it's a long story. simply put, dan heng used the jade abacus of allying oath when we were in the middle of a fierce battle, and summoned the general to help us just in time.
yes... i don't really know what to do, but... i'll do my best.
however, convincing their most chronically lazy member to help us is well within my abilities.
i'm sure she was simply trying to share some of her enthusiasm, in the hopes that you may find it infectious.
true... if someone from the alchemy commission was suggesting it could be done, then there's always a possibility.
in any case... the sight of mora has always had a way of improving my mood, no matter what the sum is.
huh... looking back now, it all seems quite dangerous... but i had the crew there with me, so the problems didn't seem all that bad.
this thing feels just like the soaring locust ii...
impressive... so, travelers of your stature hold themselves to a dress code, as well as a code of conduct.
good, i'm glad i could be of some help.
yeah, we'd never team up with someone like him!
the hatred in one's heart might dissipate one day, but the way of the ninja within their hearts will never be forgotten... ever.
the trailblazing of jarilo-vi has drawn to a close, and the astral express must depart for the next planet.
my pops and i, we mainly do business so that we won't let everyone down.
right! i bet you're quite familiar with them, too.
kyle, can i ask you a favor? i would like you to visit the residence of minister noel and ask around regarding the whereabouts of mister norbert.
ah, no wonder! he was stiff as a board and way too polite... i would have never guess he was here on vacation if you hadn't told me.
ah, don't worry, nothing was stolen this time.
i've never dared to imagine myself as a knight before... i always feared that the higher my expectations, the more disappointed i'll be if i don't live up to them...
i present to you: the dazzling seal. i am eagerly anticipating your appraisal of it, bighead fiendling.
but within teyvat, the stars in the sky will always have a place for us. even if astrology is resolutely rational, fate remains arbitrary, cruel, but romantic.
quick, back to the energy supply hub. anyone that tries to stop us is gonna find out a thing or two.
you seem to have entered into dangerous linguistic territory there. you should know that unless you have evidence to support your outlandish claims, i am legally entitled to sue you for slander.
falling asleep in a place like this... impressive!
...still better than just standing there like a scarecrow!
as for me... i don't mind trying my hand at the trending games from time to time, though i still prefer chess.
if you've no other questions, let's be off.
upon starting my military career, i made a pledge that the rest of my life would be dedicated to being the xianzhou's spearhead, hunting down the abominations of abundance till the end of my days.
could she be tired out from her cosmic concert tour? insisting on performing under such circumstances, miss robin is a superstar among celebrities!
what do you think? is the food to your liking?
what!? hold on, are you serious? i thought you'd be against it for sure!
you make a valid point. that's how innocent people should react. let's skip this question for now.
mister oleg, out of all the people we know in belobog, you have the most life experience. what do you think we should do?
ahh, this dessert is so tasty. it gets better with every bite. it's like i can't get enough.
i'm now filled with determination, masters! i'll learn swordplay well and teach that guy a lesson!
oh, never mind. i know, i'll write him a note telling him to sort out the fireworks!
i... have nothing to say to that.
a club just for fighting... who knew undergrounders had such brutal hobbies.
let's bring him back to wangsheng funeral parlor. we have much to do.
when i awoke from that place, the sea's horizon still held faint thunder, and the falling blood rain was easing -- the sight of that moment lay strikingly clear before me.
i know she can be pig-headed, but it still took me by surprise when she wrote me a long and sternly worded letter about it, chastising me for "taking this whole thing much too far."
to this end, i offer advice and tell the truth.
you might be able to remain stony-faced if you really try, but with your tail swishing behind you... hehe, it tells everything.
festivals are great! there aren't many rules, everyone has that smile that comes from deep inside, and... it's just so carefree and happy...
it's my pleasure to meet you, beautiful lady.
hmm, well i'm not convinced that it was makoto's power alone...
um... please be careful with them. don't hurt yourself.
greetings. an auspicious breeze blows this evening. tonight will be peaceful.
no... i... i don't want this...
oops, she's heard us...
um... where's he? i can't see him...
this is where we split up... she can't be too far away!
honored? heh... you should feel honored to have found me! without me, you'd be doing ten times the work for half the results.
i think i have the answer.
treating you to some food is but a small token of our appreciation.
well, what do we have here?
ha-- done! the cosmic ninjutsu is ever-changing, so i present to you the super ninja scroll!
yes, skott. you do have a choice.
ahem. o--no--de--ra?
i admit that it did feel strange for me to come to his aid... but this should have nothing to do with identity, or social class... as far as i'm concerned, it was one individual helping another in need.
there's that huge pillar called the furnace core that's always in view -- maybe it's some kind of energy hub?
he looks like he has a lot on his mind. we can't just let him go alone... why don't we accompany you to the artisanship commission?
...how come you just jumped out on your own, little fella? isn't your module thingy broken?
now that you are vanquished at our feet, allow me to recite to you the ninja mantra--
in sumeru, knowledge is holistically managed as a resource.
so humble all of a sudden, huh? are you feeling alright? should i call a doctor?
i've got goldfish memory -- we haven't had a chance to say goodbye to everyone we met so far on this trip.
to say a little more about sangonomiya... historically, there has always been some conflict between them and the shogunate of narukami island due to their different belief systems.
"take a photo"...? once again, i'm faced with a combination of words that makes absolutely no sense to me.
"wangsheng funeral parlor bumper sale! buy one, get one free! buy two, get three free! more for your mora!"
then you are one of our distinguished clients! "wood," to be precise.
i'll help her pack these things back in. you go after her.
it has been a long time. we have not seen each other since the resolution of the tenryou commission crisis.
inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. hmph.
hehe! don't worry, this time it's on me!
imagine launching a surprise attack when your enemy is fast asleep. the cheek!
when i returned to inazuma, i was shocked to find that a great sakura tree had appeared on mt. yougou. the tree that you know as the sacred sakura.
oh, don't worry about me. i just wanna see if i can stay on my feet this time~
really? but, won't research people make fun of me or something if i ask them about a legend?
oh! chest pain? ...here, i've got you. hold my arms and lie down slowly.
um... not quite my taste. "high speed" doesn't quite do the express justice.
astrology really is an incredible thing!
sorry, but it looks like we'll have to put our meteor shower search on hold.
really? i thought she was pretty icy...
i hope that this one can stay by your side in all your future adventures!
maybe my past isn't behind me, but in front of me. that's why i'm gonna keep going forward, one stop at a time... train or no train.
it's fine. i was the one who brought it up.
haha, don't drink too much, or you won't be able to sleep tonight.
the result is just as i expected... after less than half a day of interrogation, he confessed everything.
save it. you saw us in there and got scared, so you pulled a runner.
as far as i was concerned, madam cocolia's order to arrest you sounded reasonable... but why didn't she issue it straight away?
hmm... i give it a nine point five!
once, someone said to me: "no compassion for the enemy, for that is cruelty upon yourself. but you must see clearly who the true enemy is..."
please don't misunderstand us, miss topaz. we have no intention of opposing the ipc or its board of directors... but we have very dear friends on jarilo-vi.
i'm sorry, i'm not ready to talk to anyone about the reasons behind my decision... i hope you can understand.
whoa! was that a lucky guess? *gasp* did you go to a music festival without us?
and because of that, it's pointless.
favor...? count me out. what if we do it wrong and you get your cloud cronies to throw us in jail.
then again, perhaps i should finish this one first. just the one, right?
ninja initiate merchant succumbed to their sorcery. he is expected to be out of action for a while.
no special reason. i do think that a fledgling should have the right to fly in the sky... but if it can't even live to that point, then there's nothing to talk about to begin with.
we are so similar, both monsters that were born for war and will die for war... you were right when you said that, hoolay.
what's wrong? you look like you were about to say something.
so i requested less ice. hope it's to your liking.
ah, yes: "true love cannot be controlled by external forces"... little layla's belief is a classic one.
huh, this little guy looks familiar... ah! are you arlan's peppy? awwww i'm sowwie, your master isn't here. he's gone off to investigate~
exactly. that, and you are also a kind, well-mannered person with a genuine concern for other people... not to mention trustworthy. i would not feel comfortable with anyone else in this situation.
but it's a reasonable one. the statue of the omnipresent god is right by the tenryou commission. if someone set off fireworks near the statue, they certainly wouldn't ignore it.
a lady of elegance and dignity, her benevolent offer lingers in my memory. that dance... it brought me a sense of warmth and nostalgia.
this is an automated area, so don't you think that there are a bit too many people here today?
...quite the dignified study. may i use it as well?
wow! there are people everywhere. are you sure we're in belobog?
we have two extraordinary talents this year. i'm interested to see their choice of dishes.
if i am not mistaken, what we just saw was a samurai's memory that was buried in the land.
thank you for your concern, dear. but, believe me, i am quite comfortable wherever i go.
i figured it out! the day before the resurrection, he appeared near the ambrosial arbor with a stellaron!
it's just a cup of coffee... i got this...
captain kaeya has his own way of thinking and planning... sometimes, i can barely understand it, and as for imitating it...
oh -- oh mister cyrus, i... i'm terribly sorry, but actually, i...
let's leave it there, shall we? work hard, now, hehe...
all basic skills required by competent adventurers, if i'm not mistaken.
he's just surprised that it has resurfaced.
i received bronya's message before the inauguration ceremony. she told me everything that happened north of belobog -- about the stellaron, and cocolia's sacrifice...
thank you. i'll be in my room.
the nameless -- those who trailblaze, doing good deeds but never seeking recognition. after all this time, how would we even find those three people in such a vast place like penacony?
in your so-called paradise, you would be the one reigning supreme.
kouichi probably isn't back just yet, but let's go wait for him.
i came up with my name myself, but some people just call me march... which do you prefer?
beidou is well-known in liyue. she doesn't know me, but that's cool, me just knowing about her is enough. aw man... i really do wanna make friends with her.
the raiden shogun is holding a vision hunt ceremony at the statue of the omnipresent god today, to mark the one hundredth vision seized under the decree.
if you know about corrosion and the fragmentum, then you must have heard of stellarons, right?
the area to the north of belobog has been more or less swallowed up by the fragmentum. if you want to get to the northern snow plains, you'll need to get past the silvermane guard restricted zone on the front lines first.
"assertive sedation techniques..." does she mean beating people up?
youhei, i suggest you think very carefully before you open your mouth again. this is a life-or-death situation.
don't stop, don't turn back, don't look down. or up, for that matter.
tell me about it... dealing with a masked fool is exhausting...
those seals you mentioned -- do you mean these weird-looking stone lanterns?
oh, come on... you're just talking nonsense to keep me motivated.
but didn't you say the watchmaker betrayed the family? and you said you were his companion, so that means you...
this stall sells prayer plaques. it's an inazuman tradition -- you draw your wish onto a pentagonal piece of wood called a prayer plaque and pray that it will come true.
...entertainment for grownups?
by the way, we should exchange beacons. if you get lost or something, feel free to text me.
so i thought, if i'm going to meet tsubaki, perhaps a dish from overseas would make a fitting gift...
so much commotion. this must be an important meeting.
i'm sorry, brother. i always make you worry when things get serious.
yes... because if the meteorites carry leonard's will with them, then it's precisely as fischl said: the rocks are, in a sense, a curse...
one time, he shows up with another one of his friends, and the friend asks me if i remember him.
ha! i finally get to hear you say it, centuries later. oh, i must say it feels good.
oh... if the hilichurls are not around, does that mean you can't get any source material?
but, wait a moment... as a traveling merchant, you must have luggage and some goods?
...hmph! well, i suddenly feel that you have indeed contributed to our good fortune. i say we spend this money on treating you to a fine meal!
dunn... dunn? ha, why didn't you say so! no problem. we'll be back in a bit.
the books here are considered quite rare. and those material catalogs from mondstadt, hmm... perhaps they might provide some competitive market advantage.
the guard over there said that i needed an "encryption key" to open the gate. can you help me out?
i have heard all about how you helped our three friends. my sincerest thanks to you.
ahem, well, i want to prove the power and status of astrology, to be precise.
this guy really loves dramatic scenes. bet he comes from a whole lineage of stage performers.
little one, the pairings for the remaining thirty-two are out.
this is my exam, and i'm taking it to fulfill my dream. any obstacles i face are mine to overcome.
do we have any other choice? i am starting to feel a little worn out, though...
splendid. in that case, how would you like to be my partner?
seems like perkins picked up a stammer?
actually, i want to talk to you about our little lynx.
so you kids think you're better than us, huh? just you wait and see!
i understand the governing laws of the universe, and have glimpsed secrets between heaven and earth. observing it is enough for me, there's no need to force it to change.
but i do wonder whether there may be some other agenda behind their resistance movement, beyond merely fighting the vision hunt decree...
this enemy is completely different! if i didn't know it was a product of the fragmentum, i'd think we were fighting a human!
it's freezing... huh? master diviner, aren't you cold? i can't stop shivering.
spring water and seawater could not be more dissimilar.
exactly! we're xianzhou experts!
uh... she's not trying to be diplomatic about it, is she?
i'm surprised, too.
but those things... are all in the past.
what drives you to take such a risk and extend this invitation on behalf of diamond, even if it could lead to your downfall?
when that time comes, let's all pitch in and help send them on their way!
so... so we did it?
and it's behind a gate. what are the odds...
bring it on. i'm ready for your challenge.
whoa, whoa! what's with the sudden aggression!? i'm not ready!
during the hyakkiyakou, a whole swarm of youkai memories will be hanging around in the air above the grand narukami shrine. having the shrine maidens leave avoids the bothersome issue of someone potentially getting possessed.
...there's gotta be a better shot than this one!
...let's meet up here later tonight... i better get going.
which is precisely why i've decided to revive the irodori festival by...
ah, so that's why you're here... tut-tut, yes, that is a tricky situation.
i've briefly traveled with your companions and know their whereabouts, dan heng. please rest assured, your nameless companions are safe, but they need our help.
just verr goldet? ...no.
item one... lunch at liuli pavilion with ms. luo qiao.
i'm super impressed, it's pretty amazing that you managed to do this place up like a shopping street. is there a naganohara fireworks here, too? i wanna go find it!
is this the "unity" that the family espouses?
i went bright red and must have apologized, like, a million times. arghhhh, it was so embarrassing.
then again... mining builds arm strength... and then there's the hiking between ore veins... perhaps even a monster or two to fight along the way...
i gave up the jade chamber without a moment's hesitation, and i did it for the sake of liyue harbor. and now, people are inspired to follow my example, to tackle their life challenges with the same unswerving determination.
here we are at last... *sigh* it's sad to say goodbye.
*sigh* pops has started telling his stories again...
why are you speaking like the general of the luofu?
but if an opportunity presents itself, why not try to show your stuff, right?
i will head back to the library now, and continue studying!
you're too kind. my brother and i simply go where we must to fulfill our duties.
please stop, master yanqing and master yunli! i lost the duel, and now i have to accept the result. as a nameless, i don't want to be known as a sore loser.
uh-oh, sounds like something serious is happening. you'd better fill me in.
the express and i are like old friends -- we've helped each other a lot. i fixed it so that it could get back to its original route, and in return it takes me to unknown frontiers.
as a matter of fact... there is something i've been planning for a while now.
yeah, we know it's going to be dangerous, but there aren't many other options left.
stop speaking in riddles, kafka. say what you have to say.
really? sampo? you might as well try the supreme guardian.
so comfortable that... i'm a bit worried that it might be hard to adjust once i leave.
that said, if you continue down this path and find that it leads somewhere quite different from what you had hoped... what will become of that iron-clad determination then? i look forward to finding out.
i know you have many questions... do you remember when we encountered "death" in that strange dreamscape? when i was caught by that meme...
when that ambition disappeared, he began to doubt himself. as he battled his growing anxiety... he slowly descended into the state you see him in now.
oh, don't worry. i've already deducted the damages incurred by those boisterous boys from your amount.
what a smooth talker... though, your eyes do not lie as convincingly as your tongue. you came because you need my help, didn't you?
...yes. i thought i was prepared for anything, but...
i'm talking about coffee -- is that what it's called?
i can confirm that. his fate was a heavy burden indeed.
hmm, any other knights in liyue... oh! of course! if it's a knight you need, well, there's one right here!
though i do not eschew animal fat and organs entirely, they are far from my first choice.
i do these things not because i'm a maid, but because of my own will.
well my name's noelle. don't worry sir, everything's alright. i'll be protecting you from now on.
thoma is a dear friend. he always lifts my spirits with his sunny disposition. in a sense, i think of him as another brother, and as a full member of the kamisato clan.
then he goes to spare time book shop, but doesn't buy anything. finally, he leaves and turns a corner into a dark alley.
a date... hmm, we'll need a place with pleasant scenery and a quiet atmosphere...
yeah, they mentioned miss topaz! what's that all about?
tossing salt caused it to temporarily leave shingo's body. then, you exhausted its strength by fighting it, so it disappeared.
oh! what's this gadget? this monitor, and this keyboard... is it an automaton remote control terminal?
have you noticed? these landscapes seem quite distinct from that of penacony's in your dream, yet strikingly similar to the dreamscape described by miss black swan.
me?! a ghost? don't make me hit you!
alright, i'll let you shower me with praise after all the mysteries are solved.
if i remember correctly, you, march, and dan heng came here on that train -- the "astral express" -- right?
without it, the industrial hall loses its soul... we have to retrieve the sculpture before we can open to the public.
so you should also mind my warning, meng. if you won't let go of the past, i might reunite you two sooner than you think.
no matter what hoolay does, there is one truth that cannot be changed: he is trapped aboard the xianzhou luofu. the only way for him to escape is to find a ship.
hey, where are you going? we have more important things to do. stop dilly-dallying!
sakujirou and keisuke can't turn back the clock in their relationship, but... that's no reason to live with remorse.
bah, no way! everything good has come our way due to our hard work. i'm not letting them take any of the credit.
mister kurisu, are you alright?
*sigh* but the beds here are so nice!
haha... sometimes you just have to laugh at the absurdity of it all.
hehe~ ready or not, here i come, naughty children...
i'm going to be true to myself and fulfill the wish that my mother and i shared. i know that you of all people can understand me going my own way on this...
so... you'll be living forever in this dreamscape, right?
natasha! oleg! hope you didn't have to wait too long.
you've got to come and watch the fireworks this meteor shower inspired as they soar high in the sky!
but what your people need from you is not your promises. they want your attention... your divine gaze.
well... i might be totally off base here, but i think there's something fishy with this tv.
hmm, suspicious... could it really just be a coincidence? i've got a funny feeling about that lady.
he's the reincarnation of imbibitor lunae, and the person behind him is the newest member of the crew. i've heard a lot about you.
and now, i propose a toast...
...by the way, would you like something to drink? before we go, how about two cups of wake the heck up...? no, four cups.
you two have been adventuring all over teyvat, so you might not be able to understand, but for us, this is a long-awaited chance to go out and fulfill our dreams!
by making adjustments along the way, you compile what you've learned and accumulate experience.
there's still a lot of fireworks left to make. if i don't finish them on time...
between these two, who do you think is tougher, dan heng? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
seems like you're a natural. it's not easy to reach this level of enlightenment.
when she puts it like that, it actually starts to make sense...
what is this... new power!? thank you! now i can be of assistance to even more people.
even though driving away hilichurls is usually something for the knights...
i--i'm okay! let's do it! only way to find out is to give it a go!
from what i've seen, the residents are nearly all miners. it seems like the people here have less than those in the overworld.
but i think there are ways to get even subjective things back.
this guitar... i found it after going through mother's old things.
but if you still have doubts about ei, i would say they are misplaced.
i shall specially grant you leave for the next couple of days, onodera. please take the opportunity to have a good rest. after all, you will be very busy on the day of the release party.
i'll get in touch with wildfire and the silvermane guards right away and have them investigate the matter thoroughly. but for now... let's take the parts we have back to the museum, or we'll be here all night.
"the person present who shouldn't be..." who could that be?
even bigger!? oh, i wonder if it's as grand as sangonomiya shrine...
i promised itto that i'd supply fireworks for his festival. i wasn't about to go back on my word.
i see. it was the man from the limestein family who provided the information.
if we'd known of your arrival beforehand, the architects would have given you a proper welcome. i'm afraid the current circumstances are quite exceptional...
aventurine? is he still alive...? and what does he have to do with our mission to confront the dreammaster?
if what wallace said is right, then norbert must have been missing for several days already. there must be someone who knows where he is.
anyway, we needn't worry about the details too much -- it'll just be a little difficult to explain things later on, that's all.
i understand, miss bronya -- no need to explain. your city is facing immense difficulties -- my intention is simply to ensure that you have all the relevant intel.
is there something that you still have to take care of at home, mister morris?
hey, stop messing around! she was looking for me!
at this point, i'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
well, it is the holy land, what did you expect...
the omamori from the grand narukami shrine are very potent indeed. i thought i'd put one aside for you.
that guy... i don't think he has paid our salary yet... by the way, montana, do you still like slumbernana monkey?
well, we're back... just being here again is enough to make me feel dizzy...
no, it's just... this place seems familiar somehow. never mind.
the puzzle for you to solve is to use the limited number of thermic cores at your disposal to illuminate all of the designated snowshine lamps scattered around the victory zone.
a fresh catch can go straight on the grill with minimal preparation and it tastes delicious, even with no seasoning.
bad freshman! don't bully your schoolmate!
your performance at the theme park was wonderful and grandiose... a simple yet practical technique that fooled almost everyone.
i can see myself the rest of the way back.
the preparations were very lengthy this time. i don't know if it is to everyone's tastes, but i, for one, am most satisfied with the way it has turned out.
fortunately, your will was strong enough that the turbulence carried you to the moment in time most likely to be the intersection of all that you were wishing for.
of course, after all, she was a landau!
the sacred sakura can absorb and purify the filth in the ley lines. after the rifthounds attacked, some of this filth leaked out through the cracks in the trunk and formed a physical entity.
hmm? have i never told you? i've been writing my column "all things astrological" for the steambird for a long time now.
who else? do you see anyone else around here? ...well, you probably wouldn't see them if there was.
um... haha, you're right, himeko.
and it's probably not too much to ask for a rare item from the space station, right?
no, no, not at all! it is a great honor to perform my duties.
traveler, lend us your power, and we can--
...next time, let's mine together!
descendant of the kujou clan. regrettably, even if you win against me, it cannot atone for the wrongs committed under the kujou name.
die heilige sinfonie is an excellent dish. it's filling, full of energy, and has a long shelf life. and if i'm not mistaken, it's often paired with alcohol, yes?
the most popular one is the slumbernana song. ba na na na~ ba na na na~ 
hey, the "me" in the light cone looks kinda cute, don't you think?
because of the nihility, i'm rarely affected by the power of other paths, but somehow i can unconsciously infiltrate them... maybe that's the "risk" they're trying to avoid.
that's it! the windwheel aster mostly grows in stormterror's lair, at windrise, and near statues of the seven. all the others are much more widely found...
huh, besides the seal, the knife, and the bow... none of this seems like something miss tingyun would've kept. i thought she was more about jewelry and beauty.
next, i'll bring you somewhere you can really have fun.
i've run around many different penacony dreamscapes just to try and find that "legacy", and during this period i came into contact with quite a few guests. in the process, i gradually came to realize...
is that hesitation that i detect in your voice? so let me get this straight, you come begging to me for help, i actually recommend someone for the job, then suddenly you start doubting me?
really? the end result is the same, though. exactly what i do and how i do it are just minor technicalities.
rock 'n' roll dance floor atmosphere mode... who the heck added that!? and they used one of my songs!
charge with me, ninjas! let the hunt begin!
hmph, since when did you forget how to let go, cocolia?
yeah, let's go! we've got some time before we board the ship, so let's catch up with everyone at dreamjolt hostelry.
most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines... their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
adults only want to believe in objective reality. in doing so, they may unintentionally do harm to the innocent fantasies of children.
not a problem, i was thinking the same thing! but i'm afraid telling you might not be enough.
hehe. come, let's pay a visit to the venue in ritou together. i promise that it will give you a whole new perspective on the festival.
i see. you decided to admit to your feelings in an effort to bring me down with you...
but i don't know when or where it'll happen, so i figured i can search while i travel.
uh, i didn't actually cry, though, right? i just feel a bit misty-eyed.
...and then, with one swing of your blade, you must understand its meaning and the price you pay.
crazy stuff like that? not too often. it sure freaked me out.
yes. she is the memokeeper i mentioned.
i had heard that the kujou clan is no longer fit to shoulder the work of the tenryou commission. the search for a successor to the role of tenryou commissioner is indeed a matter of great urgency...
i wonder how master yanqing is doing over there...
mm... apologies, by the way. i said we would take a break and ended up bothering you.
yes, that is true. but now that the sakoku decree has been lifted, inazuma is no longer the same nation that once resisted change tooth and nail.
there is still justice to be upheld. i must prioritize assisting that cause.
great! and with that, the widely adored paimon has gifted a point each to everyone who answered just now!
the technologically illiterate fatui soldiers completely ruined the machine. even its most important component of all -- the crystalline cores -- got ejected and disappeared.
oh wow -- she's cool!
i see... i'll ask the butler to help buy some of the newest and smartest appliances and utensils.
faced with an endless battle, i had to remain focused at all times. had my concentration lapsed for but a moment, the shogun's blade would have taken my life.
obviously! wait! why does that seem so ominous...
the whole crew was watching me -- it was pretty embarrassing...
recite the incantation in your heart, little one. also, you'll need to have some intense thoughts going through your head -- a wish, for example.
ah, really? that's a bummer...
his method was a wish of sorts to begin with -- to join the past and future together and combine their beauty.
that's just it -- there is no deal...
well then, are you having a good time?
you have to suppress your anger during an interrogation, or you might find yourself using... indelicate vocabulary.
*yawn* ... that's enough sightseeing and photo-taking to last me a while...
eventually, i think i earned her trust. hehe, there were many things that she liked in the city after all.
i knew we missed something yesterday - turns out i was right: we forgot to teach you guys a lesson!
the rain... is intensifying. before we part ways, please allow me to ask a few final questions.
if so, please cast your attention this way.
come with me. let's find a quiet place. there's something i want to talk about with you.
it just makes me happy to see him smile. and it keeps him from being lonely, right?
this door... is locked too?
so be it. we shall use the upgraded guizhong ballista to fight off that god. all the adepti here can lend their strength to man it.
but their obsession gives rise to some truly inexplicable things. for example...
can't believe that worked. tampering with the dreamscape's gravity is clearly strictly forbidden...
let's get something to eat while we walk.
you'll have a hard time making friends at school if you stay out of touch. here, i'll add you two to the group.
come to think of it, ever since we arrived here, the presence of that little monkey has been making me feel a little unsettled.
i hope the jade chamber will always float in the skies above liyue harbor, bearing witness to the prosperity and peace of the human world...
but on the flip side, the prophecy is so huge and powerful that it must surely come from a powerful visionary. its contents involve the fate of the world... disregarding it would be a mistake.
somehow, for some reason, this constellation was summoned down from the sky. i suspect that the fatui have something to do with that part.
...what is this place? we've never been here before, right?
himeko! wait, is that the real you or a hologram!?
i mean, don't you have lots of friends on the astral express? what would you guys do if something like this happened?
come on now, let's all try and stay... ow! fischl! you're treading on my hair!
sincerely, beidou, you misunderstand me. i have many simple pleasures -- i take a stroll through yujing terrace and one down by the harbor every single day.
ever since i stepped into the spotlight, i have especially treasured peaceful moments like this.
but as soon as i woke up today, i remembered that we'd all be shooting a film together, and i was ready to go!
so, miss topaz, what exactly will it take for the ipc to go easier on belobog?
you mean... leave the plane of euthymia?
oooo! all those benefits that the general promised -- they're finally here! yippee!
o mighty aeon of the hunt! such vile tongue-lashing! surpassing that of even evil ninja's dispiteous curse!
know myself and know the enemy... let's see, who should i ask first?
activate all cycranes and have them scan everyone coming in and out of the port.
moze's signal is nearby, but we lost contact just a moment ago...
what she really wanted to say was this: "how soon do you think you could open a branch in the plane of euthymia?"
sounds like you're speaking from experience...
among those outsiders were several investors from the interastral peace corporation. before they departed, they did something noteworthy...
...i vow to take down a lord ravager and teach the ruin legion the true meaning of the hunt.
i think it's pretty tasty. but according to himeko, everyone else on the express doesn't really appreciate that drink...
huh... will this really get his attention?
you mean morax? it's been a while since i last saw him. a surprising decision by liyue's archon... what a fascinating god he is.
rex lapis has been killed! seal the exits!
good! that's smart of you. but you needn't worry, cocolia and i aren't even on speaking terms. it was her that ejected me from the architects -- i refuse to stand with her.
huh... how can this be? did i underestimate the caliber of this material?
not only would she buy me all sorts of tasty treats to eat, she would pamper me day in and day out. she always wanted me by her side, even when she was sleeping.
however, our family's customers are mostly regulars, so we put most of our focus on those relationships.
i want to do something a little self-indulgent. is that okay by you?
someone has to stay on the train, or pom-pom will get lonely.
hehe, this is something that will become very important to us further down the line. alright, it's time to move on to the next phase of the plan.
just pointing out the facts. mister yang will definitely have a better sense of what's going on than i do.
it wouldn't be possible with a normal pathstrider.
so even if there are parts of it that aren't really realistic nor logical, we still hope that their story gets a good ending when it comes.
that guy!? he's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! i don't like him -- can't stand the sight of him.
but i have to say, after clearing out all those unnecessary items, i feel much more refreshed.
they respond to wishes? huh. i've never heard that one before...
these kids found way more than we did fixing all those robots... what an embarrassment...
as you all know, the yashiro commission's primary purpose is managing ceremonial and cultural affairs, and inazuma's art of forging swords is a very important part of our culture.
the view here is wonderful. it smells of the rainforest here, and we're far enough away that no one will bother us.
moving forward inevitably invites further loss, but also new encounters.
i hope you have an amazing journey, serval. do remember to visit home when you get the chance.
someone's not in the best of moods... let me guess, you're all tangled up in another situation and need me to unravel it for you?
hold him accountable? come on, didn't the luofu fall victim to the disciples of sanctus medicus and the antimatter legion? why would they blame the victim?
i'm glad you've put it this way. so about the vouching...
hehe, it sounds like you'd be more persuaded if you saw me in my fox form?
mm-hmm, and i'm his boss. oh, and if there's anything unsatisfactory, let me know anytime!
so now that we've found this fan, does that mean we've won the second round of the test of courage? let's bring it back!
oh, are you sure? it's fine by us, but what does the author of the book think...
i'll stay outside and provide what stability i can. i'll be ready to respond if anything happens.
topaz shared with me the story of the stellaron's descent upon jarilo-vi -- how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
no, not at all. if i do become a knight in the future...
i understand... thanks, master gongshu!
it's a good thing that you guys managed to overcome all those difficult problems. congratulations! after the charmony festival's opening, will you guys be leaving again?
since this place seems familiar to you, why don't we explore a few more rooms and see if you can recall anything more?
hey, enough with the passive aggression!
okay, let's see what there is.
she's a flower-growing drummer and a great report writer. name a more reliable girl. i'll wait.
she runs a regular q&a column in "that's life" magazine. the people of inazuma absolutely adore her.
i remember our second day in belobog was mostly us being hunted down by silvermane guards... we didn't meet seele until way later.
i said relax, there's no need to go treading on eggshells. do you really think the eternity i pursue is something that can be shaken by dango and milk?
it is pointless to discuss "what-ifs." you have won. your prize is an entry ticket into that deep sea.
that guy can't have gotten too far! let's search nearby.
besides, you will always have me as your trusty "editor," won't you?
the almighty shogun? it would be improper of me to comment, given that i am one of her subjects. all i will say is that... i think that her excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity.
but of course... compared to the honorary knight, who defeated stormterror, i don't have nearly enough strength...
so, thank you. today really meant a lot to me, and the memories will always have a special place in my heart.
the pose is exactly the same and so is the scenery in the background... i can't imagine how it's achieved.
i'm good at documenting information and coming up with my analysis. acting on that analysis is the captain's job.
everyone here today is well-known in their own field and has probably heard about one another to some extent. some of us are even old acquaintances, so there's no need to be this formal.
yes. it's all too clear that both the tenryou and kanjou commissions are in some form of collusion with the fatui. hmph, foolish humans, blinded by their greed.
of course. the old hag could do it, and i'd bet there are others amongst those hexenzirkel colleagues of hers who could do something similar.
then you're free to find another willing buyer.
the profoundest of the profound is the musou no hitotachi. a sword art without parallel in all the world. with you as my sparring partner, i can perfect that technique even further.
we made it! from here, we can head to the space station's victory zone. hmm... the atmosphere doesn't seem to have changed much -- doesn't have that tournament vibe.
so much for your memory. did you forget the architects expelled me ages ago?
no worries, we're all just chatting here. there's no serious business to take care of.
those ingredients would be difficult for anyone else to find.
this is the true master of the space station -- genius society number eighty-three, herta.
and who is this softly spoken little lady?
...so this is the certification mark?
oh? more approachable and appeasable than you'd imagined?
tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me...? with a one-on-one duel? or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
but... i am sorry, mother. on this, our final occasion, i cannot stand with you.
a gift from belobog's number one rock star -- you're not allowed to dislike it! or at least don't tell me if that's the case...
if we want to preserve this freedom, we must act and show those who doubt us that we, belobog, have the will and the ability to control our own destiny.
i need you to find out more details about the sleepers' dreams. the more information we have, the closer we can get to the truth.
you know me. it really doesn't matter to me if our experience was real or a dream.
stay where you are. don't come any closer.
(that's right. he's a member of the tea society, so, naturally, he chose a type of tea as his alias.)
you already asked that when we first got here.
well, what do you say? aren't you two even a little curious about what interesting things you might see at the festival?
and because of this, the "end" will thus reveal a completely different meaning.
he wants to "encircle" us in one fell swoop... this beast is truly unpredictable.
oh, it's nothing. the effects of winning are only now starting to sink in. kujou sara said that she learned a lot from the fight, and so did i.
that's an episode of history that i am loath to recall. maybe to you, it seems like my response to these creatures was an excessive one.
...someone's been following you.
we have taken charge of many vital tasks in various sectors, and we are responsible for planning and organizing all sorts of affairs.
sorry... understood! stay behind me, let's move forward together.
sorry, i'm talking about work again... i should take your advice and try to relax a little.
she's hacked into the speakers!
lone voyagers in the cosmos are driven by two desires: to tread in the trails of the past, and to forge their own way. but under their scrutiny... most end up adhering to the former.
what? a party?
the information held in the ley lines is complex and disorderly. the fact that we were able to meet him to begin with was a miracle of fate...
nice! the crisis on this world is basically over, right?
indeed. any fears i had a moment ago seem to have been dissipated by the dango milk.
my brother once said that fear stems from one's heart, and if your heart is at peace, then fear naturally dissipates. now i understand what he meant.
huh? oh, it's a kitty. not gonna lie, that's kinda disappointing! i was hoping to see a real evil spirit!
let me ask you, little ones, who ever said that the festival must involve the grand narukami shrine?
we should be the ones asking that. what are you doing here?
you're very lucky that fate has decided to let us cross paths. i happen to be equipped with a very sharp blade -- sharp enough to slice through the veil of dreams. i can also carve the harmony's brand off of you...
and since the spirit is susceptible to erosion, she placed her consciousness inside her sword, where she remains in a meditative state, free from all disturbances.
i... have some unfinished business.
now that i think about it... perhaps i was too naive. she'd probably forgotten it even existed.
which is why astrology is a disdained profession! it is a mighty art, but unfortunately one that annoys people nonetheless.
are you all there? here, like last time, repeat after me--
the model in the sandpit... it's the golden hour, isn't it?
oh? well if you're quite sure, then of course. now, i shall send you on your way.
the stellaron hunters have interacted with the ipc, but not the ten stonehearts... our paths have never crossed. as for your offer, i can pass it along to my partners, but i have a question...
i'm... i'm fine... it's certainly very spicy, but once you get over that, it's quite delicious...
the facilities here seem to be in pretty good shape, not like those of a place that has been abandoned for years.
this means that becoming the director of wangsheng funeral parlor was the right decision for them and left them with no regrets.
the thought of being able to eat the most expensive dishes and drink the finest sake, all for absolutely free... oh, i just couldn't wait any longer.
uhh, i'm pretty sure i should be, almost k--kinda ready to go...
you know the way to the great mine, right? let's catch up with gepard when you're ready!
afterwards, why not sit down for a while in the jade chamber, or have a short stroll? rest is also an integral part of any journey.
alright meng, keep adding those special offers to the wooden tiles! the future of our business depends on it.
that would be something of an oversimplification.
i mean, considering how you helped us out with cocolia, i'm sure bronya would be happy to see you!
let's cut to the chase. before the crisis struck, the astral express was guided here by a stellaron hunter, a wanted felon, in an attempt to resolve the stellaron crisis.
then i'll admit to collaborating with sakujirou and accept the tenryou commission's punishment!
and the crew too. there are too many people who you owe... an explanation.
just as every life that edges closer to death fervently approaches the end of the nihility...
"happiness is the dream of the humble." does this mean we can take it? something feels weird about this...
aw, come on, i'm really only asking you to finish what you started. besides... your paychecks are still in my hands. heh, heh, heh.
well, you should probably write down the recipe now, no?
that is true. our memories make us who we are, and all memories originate from the "now." as for the future... it's already taking root in the now, isn't it?
anyway, what's next? should we visit liyue's harbor, or take a short break?
i don't think it's that simple.
as for boothill, as you may have guessed... i've been waiting for you. galaxy rangers are known for their elusive nature and limited contact with each other, so this is the only way i could "reach out" to you.
still, whatever their situation, a crime is a crime. *sigh* how is the law supposed to find a balance between justice and compassion in the face of such complexity...
it's a good bow. it couldn't be meant for me... could it?
not long after i submitted my preliminary report and application, i received my punishment. it was obvious that somebody didn't want my research to continue.
we're just having a walk. neither of us could sleep. you can rescind your baseless accusations.
please never do that again...
look -- that big guy down there -- is he the one in charge?
but things are a little different with these particular informants. mora doesn't get you very far with this crowd...
so you mean that it symbolizes dreams?
exactly. that's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
a "ceremony," you say? why would such a task be left to the tenryou commission?
and yet five whole days pass before it occurs to you to come and seek help from me. you really expect me not to notice the gaping holes in your story?
giovanni? i wonder what he's up to...
mister payne! are you feeling any better? is there anything you wish to tell me?
that i do not deny. however, final victory was always going to be ours, even had things been a little more arduous.
but i dared not speak. i could only gaze at him in silence until the moment i awoke.
so i'm looking forward to the rest of our journey -- every single step of it.
silvergun shura, even with my super hearing, i'm no longer able to detect the sounds of the fiendling. perhaps ninja gama is right.
this opportunity is a godsend. i cannot let it slip by.
but before that, on the road towards the end, there are still many things that we can do.
miss topaz is definitely up to the job! she has that aura of... what's the word... invincibility!
i'm a little incredulous, but it turns out her blind guess was actually spot on... ugh, no, i'm a respectable astrologist, and i shouldn't stoop to that kind of criticism.
you know something, gepard? that guitar case in your hand, and my guitar... they're both from the same prototype -- the "super electromagnetic flux player."
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "the stone heart of a ninja is immune to pressure, immune to lies, come wind, rain, or shine."
ah! so that's how it is, no wonder i haven't heard from bronya... is she alright?
you keep asking the champions of each venue to give us cryptic hints, don't you? what's that all about?
in the end, i haven't been able to guard anything. how could they have thought i was worthy to be the successor...
as far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. they complemented each other, and they ruled inazuma jointly. so there was no need for the public to know the truth.
from this very moment... back down, retreat? the hero says "never" -- the way of the ninja burning in their heart forever.
how about it? ready to take off that armor and sit down for a talk?
the monsters of the fragmentum don't need any materials we humans use. and if they did take anything, this place would look much messier...
i feel a little awkward taking it by myself. would you like to join me? let's commemorate this moment.
simple. it wrote a summoning incantation in the book, didn't it? so we can just use its own method to make it manifest itself.
i'm not surprised to hear that from a nameless. if you ask me, i'd say it was the unity of the family that brought this dream into existence -- and the dream has become just as loving and forgiving as the family.
i think i know what it will concern. even if oleg wasn't looking for me, i would've looked for him.
a slow-boiled soup of leftover chicken and pork bones drenched over some cabbage leaves. i have few culinary requirements. having a few staple dishes like this is enough.
by the way... remember to focus constantly on your heartfelt wishes when you enter inside.
i'm afraid that sooner or later, they are going to find you here. time is starting to run out.
i know what this is! it's a belobog heater! umm... wait a minute, what's a belobog heater doing at the healer's market?
turns out, pom-pom's been silently putting in a lot of work for us, wow...
uh, do you know her?
good point! names, we need names! suddenly showing up like this, surely it must be keisuke's doing!
"from vendors i bought some fifteen steaks, at dinner i sizzled the lot. at pressure the tenderloin cooks in two ticks, but fifteen won't fit in the pot."
we can't trust everything kafka says. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
head back to your rooms, get some rest, and prepare to enter the dreamscape.
where did you come from little one? is your dad around?
now that belobog is gradually returning to normal, we are also slowly reconnecting with the outside world. i have to take as much of your knowledge back with me as possible to prevent any potential enemies from endangering us.
slumbernana monkey likes goofing off and loves eating bananas. it lives a carefree life in the moment of slumbernana.
if you have the courage, you can come with me on a stroll in the mountains one night to see for yourself.
all right, everyone. let's make a decision.
that may well be, but there's also nowhere else for us to go.
even such a trivial interaction fills me with motivation. amazing...
is this... the lower level of the commercial district?
oh, don't worry, there's still some time. once you've taken care of everything, we can enter the arena together.
however, the bond formed by friendship will not be broken, but rather, carried on in a new form.
heehee, i'll take it! and on that note -- boy, do i have an art show for you tonight! make sure you don't miss it!
y'know, i didn't think things were gonna go that smoothly.
hm... well, do you prefer red meat or white?
it's no skin off my back anyway, so i thought i'd give it a shot. what about you two? what academy did you get?
uh... what exactly are--
of course. we're schoolmates now!
done! it took some effort, but we finally cracked these mechanisms...
yes. it took persikov all of his strength to get all the missing soldiers into the cave. he tried to snap them out of it with music and poetry...
i guess so, but that still doesn't fix bronya's problem...
i dreamed that we ran and jumped atop large mushrooms, and we discovered urstone in a very unexpected way...
hm, let's see... where should we go next?
so she asked someone to look after the shop for her... but where are they? looks like they must have left too.
seriously... there's nothing inside this dream bubble?
oh, it's you. we'll need two more bowls of ramen, please.
for my sake, and for inazuma's, please... bring her back.
i won't steal pom-pom's thunder. if you have any questions, just go ask our conductor.
i'm not gonna let you off easy, so it's not too late to admit defeat.
but when i caught a glimpse in her eyes, i only saw yearning, and a deep sense of loss.
...i saw you the day before the goethe hotel. gepard took you to see mo-- ...the supreme guardian. he told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
uhm, yes. i totally agree.
fish...? no, don't play dumb. is this some kind of game?
yes, that is the plan... the future of the ninja capital shall be shaped by the dazzling ninja hero. i will definitely fulfill my promise.
maybe you can just stay behind this time, mister yang...?
i should've known... don't quit your day job.
hey, are you one of the fatui? can you tell us what happened here and what that machine is for?
trust is of far greater importance than profit in the relationship between me and my informants.
yes, you're right. after all, the shogun is currently unable to take care of business on my behalf.
the answer should be quite obvious by now, surely?
...we don't need another amnesiac on this train...
and when i thought we had woken up, the next part was even more amazing!
also, please stop making it sound as if i somehow need the company.
that's because you were zonked out the whole ride. no one had the chance to tell you.
this grand theater looks totally different... is this the power of the order?
hehe... now you're following me.
i'm a bit tired too. let's sit down at the snack bar for a while.
so much for cutting calories...
everything's fine. we were able to suppress the borisin attacks. when i sensed that hoolay was not on the ground, i raced to get here as quickly as i could.
indeed. i also informed fischl of this when we parted ways today. if she runs into them, she'll stay hidden and out of danger.
(hah, it's quite amusing to watch how all of this is playing out. a little nudge in the right direction and things will become much more dramatic...)
yes, but what made you ask that all of a sudden?
i'd love to help her as a friend... but she was right about one thing. we're going to explore another island today.
i doubt i'll be able to sleep either... not that i don't trust you! it's just... you're a silvermane guard officer in the underground. there might be people looking to harm you.
that makes sense... if only i'd fought together with you just now...
we'll come up with something. don't worry, conductor.
can you two say anything without quarreling? this isn't the time! it sounds like there's danger waiting for us in the inner section, can we still get through?
a vessel arrives at a deserted spaceport... isn't that how, like, loads of horror movies start!?
hmm, let me think what i could offer you as a reward. or perhaps there's a favor i could do in return?
besides, i'm the one who should be apologizing -- i've put my own personal reasons ahead of belobog's reconstruction...
what a coincidentally convenient plot twist... it'd be even more awesome if the organizers allowed me to wear armor.
have no fear, bronya! when a friend's in need, the nameless will always be at their side!
it's settled then. my, look at the time. i have to meet with my editors, so i must be going now.
haha, paimon told me that she had the same reaction when she first saw the pot.
that's all you needed to say! let's go.
we're all heading towards an unknown destination, like we are traveling together.
huh. so it's selling slowly? why is that?
...and yet she decided to challenge its power -- a power beyond human comprehension. supreme guardian cocolia sacrificed herself to dispel the dark clouds enveloping this city.
and where we're going, don't be surprised at what you may see or what may occur.
it's true that the more i study, the more unprepared i feel. it's inevitable that i'll run into something unexpected...
i wasn't sure. it was just a hunch, but since misha feels familiar with this place... my hunch might be correct.
let's focus on the business at hand. that miner we met said his brother came this way -- we should look around.
we can and we will! i think it's great!
if i knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
before i left inazuma, many people heard that i was looking for a meteor shower, so they told me that they wanted to make wishes.
look! rappa's here too. looks like she's thinking along the same lines as us!
straight to the point. i like it.
now, we can go to the other side. this is how the nightingale family repairs the dreamscape. fascinating, isn't it?
it's all my fault! i didn't train enough!
alright, well, let's not stay out here in the open for too long. hurry up and get back inside. i'll let you know as soon as i have an update for you.
oh, it was very good! thank you, chef mao.
...there, there, take your time, try and take a deep breath first...
if sakujirou is caught, there's no knowing what crimes they could charge him with. all we can do is find him a boat and send him out of inazuma again.
you two as well. no matter how busy your adventures get, remember to come back to inazuma. we'll always welcome you, no matter when you drop by!
mmm, now i'm hungry. alright, let's knock this out and then go grab some food!
osu! having persevered through unending nights of tribulations, i now boast... the vast senses of a ninja hero.
can you two come with me? let me put my thoughts together, and tell me if you understand.
mining? you use your sword for... mining?
but as a warrior, i look forward to the chance to fight like this again in the future.
it was there and then that i resolved to pursue eternity. as a testament to that decision, i saved her realm of consciousness just before it collapsed completely, and brought it back to inazuma.
hello there, would you be interested in understanding a bit about our services at the wangsheng funeral parlor?
what do you mean? this is such an inter-- uh... inconvenient situation.
excellent. the mountain road ahead is a little treacherous, watch your step.
there was a wandering samurai who, while crossing the forest at night, noticed that the familiar scenery was beginning to change right in front of him.
okay. well, see you soon, then.
and for good reason, no? a bolt of lightning from you would make even my fur stand on end.
they're still smoldering -- the culprit can't have gotten far.
keep him with you. do not let him slip away.
this place is really complicated. it gives me a headache every time i pass through... not only do we have to activate the dream's eye, but we also have to close it a couple of times to get through.
what must have transpired to cause her such a drastic change? ...still, orders are orders. it's not for soldiers to question their superiors.
ah, just as i thought, he isn't back yet. but not to worry, because actually, i've been hoping for a chance to have a nice long chat with you all day.
there shouldn't be much left to say. this entire adventure started because of you, and should naturally end with you.
and that's when they sent topaz over to collect the debt...
that's right, we'd never sell out our friend!
*sigh* i can't remember the last time i got such a polite response.
they are a part of it! it's basically a tableful of as much tea, sweets, and good company as you can manage.
that's right. i'm the march seventh that everyone's been talking about.
speaking of... traveler, what do you think of the resistance army's chances?
my affection for the arts stems from the education i received at home.
building a better world for future generations sound great, right? but is it any fun for the engineers and architects who are directly involved in such a pursuit?
we're here to help sort out miss tingyun's things. madam yukong wants to use some of them for her soul-soothing ceremony.
you certainly don't disappoint.
so many years... have i been following lies this whole time?
kinda like fireworks, in a way. don't question it, just feel it...
wasn't this the dead tree qingque showed us earlier? how did it grow all of a sudden?
cashing in time and mora for power... interesting. this shows their true value.
if i neglect these topics now... i may live to regret it later.
you should be happy it's us and not natasha! if she'd found you, you'd be in big trouble already.
*sigh* fine, i'll exercise a little patience, and explain.
but who would launch such an obvious attack? they just want to stir up chaos.
it's okay, i know. you were just following the rules. plus, we really are quite behind schedule with the printing.
the spirits we saw near the border are the dead that still long for the world of the living.
everyone's waiting for you, so hurry up and pack. we're leaving as soon as you're ready!
i've never heard the name "arataki" before... but they must be one of my subjects, and so i thought, why not grant them their wish?
i like keeping busy, otherwise i start obsessing over... pointless things.
i suppose the conclusion is: i can't become an outrider like amber.
don't worry, miss topaz. myself and all of the nameless aboard the astral express are willing to vouch for this world.
but when it comes to the intricacies of tea-making, the people of inazuma also have their insights.
still, the ice that trapped me was six-phased ice -- a very rare substance. i don't think you can find it on your average planet...
unless someone goes to the other side of the barrier...
now that that's settled, let's go pay a visit to the museum lobby secretary, eris. she's a talented worker and can tell you everything there is to know about museum matters.
makoto died several hundred years ago in a war that i was not personally involved in. since then, ei has assumed the shogunate.
that's more like it. ah, one more thing...
i followed kitsune saiguu around the mikawa flower festival one year and saw her play akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura.
never forget who you truly are, ninja initiate gigaku.
ah, after hearing chizuru describe the original mikawa flower festival, i wanted to arrange another chance to talk with her about it.
...the contract topaz sent to me a little while ago. there's a handwritten letter attached.
please, that's how those heroes in the immersia show their respect...
o miss klee, our mighty spark knight, you are the flame of hope for all of mondstadt, and the vessel for...
i think the key will be to make something that easily catches the attention of people who haven't played much chess before.
so that's what you like about it... *sigh* i guess most people probably think the same way.
taking pictures. writing in my diary. what else is there to say~?
then where did it go? and why is it so quiet all of a sudden?
as she indicates, once i started entertaining the idea of change, i became hostile in her eyes.
i know that... i just never expected to hear you say it.
our paradise is none of your concern, masked fool. leave now, or the family won't tolerate you anymore.
so... help me educate march about not messing with the equipment on the express.
you keep saying that -- what did dan heng even say...
i've read "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." it has many other good qualities besides the incantations alone.
the universe is vast, and our lives are but specks. the trailblaze never ends, but against the backdrop of the cosmos, the average person's lifelong journey is merely a short stretch.
makoto's gaze was always fixed on the people of inazuma. i always assumed it was because... that was her duty.
be it my duties as her heir, or a silvermane guard, i must face my problems head-on. even if...
...alright, alright, i give up! that sculpture has dozens of individual parts -- there's no way we'll recover them all at this rate...
wait! there are silvermane guards here. careful not to alert them!
oh? you know the song? not bad. you're keeping up with the trends.
oh, of course... they... don't call me the, uh, "wondermaid" for nothing...
aventurine has devoted considerable attention to her. but this galaxy ranger... we know hardly anything about her and can't rush to any conclusions.
traveler, it seems liyue has a way of drawing you back every once in a while. do you miss it here?
it's through this inherent self-centered instinct that people exert their utmost effort, even when they know their struggle is fruitless. as absurd as it may seem, it's their resistance.
besides, if i can get the hang of this teapot trick, i'll be able to bring an unlimited supply of sake and snacks with me wherever i go...
the true "death"... where everyone in penacony loses themselves completely in the eternal sweet dream of the order.
where are you going? it wasn't easy to get in, so don't do anything that'll draw unnecessary attention. at least... stop pointing your gun at people?
you entered the dream they've all been having, didn't you? how much do you know about leonard?
baishi has always been very passionate about her work. i can leave any task in her capable hands and rest assured that her performance will be nothing short of exemplary.
still, your answer has put me in a good mood.
we should defeat it just to be safe. fragmentum creatures are belobog's enemies -- they shouldn't be trusted.
oh wow, the train carriages are so cool. can we put a little stage there?
one bowl of ramen shouldn't hurt, right?...
maybe it's because it'd been so long since i last saw her, but... somehow, all that was left of her in my mind was the side of her that inspired awe and commanded respect...
okay, but working as a day laborer could be quite dull...
haha, i just assumed you must've gotten yourself a pet puppy.
you cannot weaken my resolve, hoolay.
right! i'd totally forgotten -- that's the whole reason we came here in the first place!
right, yes... it's a shame she couldn't be here to present it to you in person.
well hang onto it, it's cute.
that's why it's named the "border," you can't just cross whenever you please. you need to have a little -- ah, how do people normally put it... "pomp and ceremony"?
it's... ninja gama?
...mother! you were out for so long, we were beginning to worry about you.
welcome back. i trust beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
here's what i need you to do: go into town and find evidence of the tenryou commission's betrayal.
no one questioned it, and yet its presence contrasted so starkly with the area as i remembered it... it seemed as if i was the only one to have noticed it appear suddenly out of thin air.
very good. and murata?
what you said back there... did you really mean it?
aha! there we go!
even if you don't believe my outsider friends, you should believe me... ugh, maybe i've wasted your trust... in which case, believe bronya.
but the hilichurls could return at any moment. mister tian, please find a safe location from which to observe.
that thought has been growing stronger ever since i boarded the express... and saw views that would never have been visible from the city or the snow plains.
this planet's fate, the civilization it carries, everything that has happened here and everything that will happen... it all rests in my hands...
i think i need to do... this!
but tartaglia isn't like that at all, he's really nice to the kids. he even had an in-depth discussion with them about the great mujina youkai's combat skills...
sometimes, we stop on other worlds and we'll continue to do so. there are countless "next stops" in the galaxy.
is this really the right place...? it's so quiet all of a sudden.
only by reflecting on our steps can we remember the path we should be walking on... and the companions who have walked alongside us.
children in liyue have these dreams too. i never would have thought...
as it turns out, the "big g" that meng is looking for is a ghost adrift in the mortal realm.
what the heck is she talking about? master diviner, did you actually say that at the time? i can't remember.
wow, he seems like a real gentleman! maybe he's not as uptight as i thought.
as long as i can bear the pain of the memoria pressure, i'll be able to dive into the primal memory zone beyond the dream, and extend a lifeline to the radiant feldspar.
ooh, maybe i should commission a sequel: reborn as guuji yae. what do you think?
me? i'd suggest you go yourself. even if you don't want any more dealings with her, it's best to say that to her in person... reading this message, it seems like she may really need your help.
forget it. let's visit the other booths.
taking every chance to pat yourself on the back, i see.
i have tasked my three most trusted secretaries with overseeing an important auction tomorrow. this, however, leaves their regular duties unattended to, and the work cannot afford to go undone.
no, they don't... if they truly serve the harmony, that is.
the story is fun and action-packed, with no dark undertones. also, there are a great many legends about rex lapis. i'm sure it will spark the people's curiosity.
the issue isn't the projector, but the microfilm that goes into it. it's the most crucial piece of this exhibit, and it was stolen.
the path in penacony is impure. the harmony here has impurities.
if i'm not mistaken, the two of you just rushed over here from the history and culture museum? i appreciate your coming here on such short notice.
you may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the yaoqing's warriors.
come on, let's head to our next destination -- herta space station victory zone!
oooh! that's quite the compliment, don't you think?
with the help of the sacred sakura's power, i was finally able to overcome the monsters and quell the disaster in inazuma.
after all, it is but a tiny minority of people who receive visions. moreover, it is not unknown for visions to spark jealousy in others.
you wouldn't understand! all cute things in the world should share a mutual affinity!
...send this report to the ministry of civil affairs and have them delegate each of the tasks on the list to the appropriate departments.
very well. based on my investigation so far, i believe this next pack of monsters should be the last.
when we were handling that luofu stellaron matter. i told pom-pom about it first thing.
i'll do my best to tell you everything i know when we get there.
...but i think i failed. maybe... there are other things that you guys do?
time for dessert. what? why not? what do you mean, "entrees come first"? ...they were only indulging me because i am the shogun? huh, interesting.
everything in this world runs on its own set of principles, be it the circle of life or sugar and spice! you either get it or you don't.
hmph, i only took you there to demonstrate how tense things are. somehow we only tested the waters but ended up with the catch of the day.
everyone has done some pretty amazing things.
oh! let's go to windrise!
no, no, her address is given in the notebook -- we can head straight there. i wanted you to assist me with the preparation of greeting gifts...
...the atmosphere in the village is great. i've gotten some poetic inspiration just walking around!
hehe, this tournament was advertised far and wide, including all the way over in inazuma. they even handed out flyers in front of yae publishing house.
make no haste. since i am now a ninja hero fit to contend with the evil ninja... would you let me join you in your crusade?
vowing to protect the underworlders in one breath, and then deciding they deserved to be abandoned in the next... "family code of conduct" -- what a joke.
we'll see who wins next time. what do you say, miss "sole of the deep"? how about a rematch?
i'll take care of her. can you two look for her wheelchair?
this is all but a fleeting dream, one of the thousands of manifestations of ix... under the watchful eye of nihility, we momentarily linger here, before moving on to our own paths.
nothing to do with you? yeah right -- sounds like a weird coincidence to me. you just happened to show up after the stellaron burst...?
overall, i think this task was a success...
that will do. i will have the okuzumeshuu continue the investigation from here.
beelzebul is ei, with whom we are now both acquainted. baal's name was "makoto."
i believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his nameless friends. similarly, i'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
can't believe you're in the mood to crack jokes...
yes, and for that, i'm sorry.
everything is turbulent and disordered... if you try to force your way in, you could be swept away by a giant wave that sets you down in an unknown corner of space-time.
we didn't know about this case at all when we joined the film. is it going to affect the reception of our work...?
ah... there's no place like home. i never feel completely free out there.
the commission wouldn't normally cause this big of a fuss over a stowaway.
i believe it's fair to say that... i owned that one.
hee-hee, yup! when you're free, let's head over to the divination commission together and ask them for a favor.
i need to explain myself. i got a little nervous back there and... i--i just made up any old excuse. but don't think of this as me taking you sight-seeing, please!
huh... who's wilder? ...and what's "aetherium wars"?
on top of that, every action she ever took was seen as representing the kamisato clan. people were always watching her. under such circumstances, she never had much time to do the things she really wanted to do.
so that's what article eight of the knights of favonius handbook really means...
we didn't have anything to hide in belobog, either...
okay, i'll be heading back now. i'm sure we'll meet again soon!
who are you? i don't remember you.
oh please, do your worst~ i never asked souka to win in the first place. besides, maybe suffering a humiliating defeat will give her the epiphany she so desperately needs.
hold on, sir... we have documents authorized by the family that would aid your investigation. if it wouldn't trouble you, could we see this mister gallagher?
other people might fall for that, but i won't!
y'know, i never guessed you'd become a pro at this job -- i only wanted you to experience the fun of working here...
i never imagined that something i learned about unexpectedly would become the key to connecting everything.
but it seems the desire to protect one's own people is the same everywhere.
fine, i suppose. i could use some help though.
my master and her friend contended in the mystic arts all their lives without a clear victor. if i triumph here, then i will show myself to be superior to my master!
i do as she wishes. i can say no more than this.
is this the lesson you learned from your journey in liyue?
today is indeed a momentous day to have brought us all together. i propose that i treat everyone to a meal to mark the occasion, if it pleases you all?
which means that you, svarog -- uh... you won't have to worry about preserving the underworld... for the time being.
we cannot allow the fighting to continue. this is now a race against time to stop this farce that hoolay has created.
noon is upon us, we should eat. hm? i... i will have a salad, for simplicity is the way of the astrologer.
the answer is... when they are in desperate situations.
you are the one who organized the plans for this release party. in other words, you are the team's fearless leader now. so please, show some confidence.
at his age, he might not appreciate the extra... excitement.
aventurine... what about the other set?
oh, i see! so you just missed me all of a sudden? oh, you -- why'd you have to go and be so thoughtful, hmm? i couldn't possibly bring myself to scare you with a ghost story now!
the express has faced all kinds of obstacles on its journey -- today is just another one. it's no reason to stop trailblazing.
business development is a crucial element of every prosperous enterprise. i've been trying various marketing strategies ever since i became the director.
...never mind. i won't ask if you don't wanna talk about it.
during my absence, i place everything in miko's hands.
i have gathered everyone here today to make an important announcement.
denied. use of force has been forbidden.
looks like she also sent you a message...
go to a corroded town to collect some useful resources? i'm in.
actually... i have always wanted to receive guidance from the honorary knight.
he wreaks havoc across the universe with his fiendlings in tow. he is the enemy of the ninja capital and my archenemy -- evil ninja osaru.
yes. this is the strongest piece of evidence we have to go on.
i should mention that once a path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its aeon. that is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite akivili's passing.
a--are you sure? you don't need to use a crazy device or do more finger-counting?
by the way, what did you do to that man earlier? it was like someone took him on an emotional roller coaster.
...it wasn't until the stellaron crisis was resolved that the ipc discovered that belobog had survived...
i'll lend you an extra brain cell.
now that i think of it, mister giovanni mentioned that the previous tournament champion was defeated by the elite player...
think of it more as a reward for being the runner-up.
so, what exactly are you gonna do?
"mister skott, a great sinner of arrogance and insolence."
haha, i just wanted to make this a surprise for everyone! the warehouse isn't far from here. we'll be there in no time.
phew... it looks like i still have a long way to go.
my grandpa had a huge argument with him, but he couldn't convince him to stay.
my palms were sweating and my heart was racing, and...
the looks on your faces tell me you found some good stories.
stay? but herta...
aw, you really care about the little one quite a lot, don't you? hm, i'm a little jealous. i wish my friends were caring like that.
hey march! don't forget to take a picture of the stellaron for me.
so much to learn before the exam, how will i ever get through everything?
she's his "family..." did you really forget?
another door. more delightful individuals await us on the other side, i assume?
your ambition should be something that transcends the world below and the starry sky above. something that shines in unison with fate itself.
let me see here... soggy food, an odd shoe, a broken mirror, small wooden toy...
i wonder why topaz would come to a place like this...
i just think that after all your journeys together, you two must have developed a super close bond, and just naturally know how to work with each other! if i'm not mistaken, the director will want the kameras rolling as soon as the clapperboard goes "clack"!
thanks to the family business, i've got tons of connections. haha!
incidentally, this will also be the best way to combat the influence of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits."
excuse me, payne, here is the drink you ordered...
you mentioned appropriate compensation. perhaps you could fill in for this shrine maiden and greet visitors for the day, hmm?
fireworks are more visible at night... if possible, i suggest you wait till after dark to put your plan into action.
contact the exalting sanctum. tell them, if they see a light in the sky, all units are to retreat immediately!
hehe, not the answer you were expecting to hear, hmm? ah, the look of stunned surprise on your face... i think it might be my favorite.
yeah, time has a way of smoothing things out. the beautiful dreams of youth... will eventually fade away.
*yawn* ...so tired. i just wanna put my head on a pillow and drift off...
never mind, let's head inside first. once fischl finds the book, i'm sure she'll be able to catch up with us.
well done. and what about you, onodera?
could we tone down the narcissism just a tad?
so, who is he talking to? do you know anything about it, misha?
yes, you're right. i'm wary of any and all change, but i do not wish for my pursuit of eternity to stop human lives from changing for the better.
also, be sure to tell them that though the lantern rite may be complicated, everything must be done properly.
someone once said to me: penacony wasn't like this a long time ago, nor should it be.
of course, if you have any genuine grievances about the auction, the lots, or the process, please enlighten me as to where exactly i went wrong.
when i was little, the other mondstadt kids and i always used to imagine what kind of visions we would have when we grew up... i hope that, someday, this boy's dreams will come true, too...
but even then, inazuma was left more devastated than we could have ever imagined. those terrible tragedies left great wounds that are still felt to this day, both on the land itself... and in my heart.
that's our bronya -- quick as a flash!
did you hear that? this mechanism must be on now!
let me guess -- time, karma... i bet the next terminal is energy-related!
mm-hmm. i was also here for the first round, but i arrived a little early, so maybe that's why i didn't see you.
mister sunday, even if the members of the oak family can't fully agree on what to do about the stellaron, now's not exactly the time to be holding an extensive discourse about penacony's past and future, is it?
...ah! i shouldn't be talking about this. pretend i never said anything.
so my plan is... to incite rebellion in the tenryou commission.
it's just a small token of appreciation, but i hope you'll accept it.
so the key is whether or not you yourself can develop a sense of belonging in liyue harbor.
all that you have experienced during your travels is sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
who do you think? it's obviously the same people who stole the meteor fragment.
no, of course not. you are my honored guests.
the key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. it's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
that place up ahead is aideen park -- everything here is themed around soulglad. it's a little crowded, so make sure you stay close to me.
i have always greatly enjoyed working with guuji yae. organizing festival affairs generally takes a lot of effort and doesn't generate much income, but guuji yae's events always come off both elegant and profitable.
anyway, are you scared, little friend? don't you worry, now, it'll be over soon. just think of it like having a dream.
i firmly believe that with the determination of everyone, our world, the world the trailblazers call "jarilo-vi," will no longer be alone among the stars.
here, these rewards are for you. i hope they come in handy on the journey ahead.
was the other puzzle piece... taken away by it?
if that sounds okay, i'll place the order for you. this meal is on me, to make up for my inattentiveness.
the statue... is that...
hold on now. would you like to be a shrine maiden for a day as well?
then it's as i feared... on the way here, i heard that thoma had been taken away by the tenryou commission.
oh? you're earlier than i expected...
unfortunately, the semifinals is where my journey ended. the reason being...
we were intending to defeat you in a duel and make you apologize to her, but now we see that won't work.
what a great mindset you have. if anyone ever called me anything less than a genius, i'd be furious.
what's wrong? not turning in? can't find your room, or do you have something on your mind?
treasure hoarders, i see... yes, i can imagine that must have been rather irksome.
why? why is every elevator in the underworld busted!?
paimon, please. "who wrote this book, and why? don't we think there might be a bigger safety risk here?"
an adventurer friend of mine once told me that if you're too focused on reaching the end of the race, you'll miss a lot of opportunities and precious moments to be had along the way.
hmm, that means i'm friends with a hero, doesn't it?
"prinzessin der verurteilung"? i'm sorry, which nation are you a princess of?
if it is the order that drove you to imprison welt and robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.
we're counting on you, welt. as for us... let's get ready to see the dreamscape's true visage.
oh? what would you like to know, paimon?
before i lost my memory... so, something i don't remember getting? even then, i couldn't be sure it was from before i lost my memory, right?
the tenryou commission is heavily guarded. be careful when you get near. let's meet back here afterwards.
huh... reminds me of the accusations against me. cocolia's methods haven't changed.
it was there that we bid each other a final farewell. i cried bitterly. even in those final moments, i couldn't understand her actions.
look at it whenever you're feeling down. who knows, maybe it'll raise your spirits. if nothing else, you'll know that i'm supporting you all the way.
i wonder how mister tian's story will turn out in the end. for some reason... i have a bad feeling about it...
a--are you sure about this? if you share the recipe... isn't that tantamount to giving away your trade secrets... or something?
the word "borisin" was only used to refer to those wolf masters. i'm a foxian who was born in one of the "fallen territories"...
is there anyone who doesn't carry around a past burden? she may not remember it, but even a girl as carefree as march has hers.
he's done right by us so far... shall we head over?
mmm, such fair weather. why don't we do a bit of sunny work? oh, what sort of work is that, you ask? haha, well, anything that makes you feel bright and sunny too.
you witnessed human memories leaking from the ley lines, didn't you? well, since there are human memories, of course there are going to be youkai memories, too.
if we're content to settle for just seeing people off, how can we give them a sense of really having "gained" something?
she also noticed that the weinlesefest was in full flow, and asked if i was interested in checking it out with her.
don't you have something else to tell us, gallagher?
you willingly took this work on, knowing that it would be tedious, and you have worked diligently. my secretaries and i are very grateful to you.
we were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself...
well, just a hazy past that i can barely recollect. long ago... i was one of them.
the gift? is there something wrong with the gift?
curious about this blade? when unsheathed, it unveils the memories stored within -- every instance i've swung it, in the beginning, the end... and nothingness.
it's at the rivet town plaza, right? let's hit the road, there's no time like the present!
well, if that's how you feel, then... okay! we'll take you up on your kind offer, sir! let's each do a draw.
but... but waitressing in the tavern should be a good means of gathering intel, right? it's quite a common motif in the books i've read.
we all worked really hard this year. whether traveling or guiding...
*sigh* leaving aside the issue of the enormous manpower and resources such an operation would require, going to such lengths over a light novel would be extremely disruptive to the lives of inazumans.
everything outside is... red. what's going on?
mm-hmm. catching up with an old friend i hadn't seen in years was truly delightful.
hmm, a gift for someone who was once seen as the hydro archon. i wonder what she would like...
home, sweet home! mister yang and himeko must be bored given how long our train had to stay here.
because... sakujirou may not have told me about you when he came back, but he did order a firework from me.
there's always a way for me to contact him if i need to, so don't worry!
but as you can see, sir, no innocent bystanders were affected in this incident.
while i trust the bravery of the divine foresight and the nameless, i'm curious about some details missing from the report. i'd like to take this chance to have an exchange with both of you.
my meeting with ninja initiate gigaku was purely happenstance, but i did not come here alone. these nameless ninjas are also my companions.
hahaha, don't worry, it's just a firework, come on. what's the worst that could happen!
understood! we'll head there at once, miss bronya.
which makes the prospect of a carefree, honest chat here with you... all the more valuable to me.
take your time, pick some good ones. i'll be right here.
hehe, but if you insist... then let's look around!
we must do everything we can to prevent that.
*sigh* i wanted to keep it with me... but that's the problem with old things -- the less you use them, the easier they break. besides, no one's paying me to fix it, right?
thus, the gnosis became not only useless, but also a potential source of conflict.
and the fact is... you're hurrying to help others...
so then. the day's ahead of us. any ideas on how to spend it?
to the outsider, the realm of consciousness is a very abstract concept. luckily, i'm ei's familiar, so i can sense her rough whereabouts.
aiya... if you don't have enough, then why not just carry it through a few more times?
anyway, i need to go update sakujirou. see you, kouichi! thanks again for your help!
good, then let's do that. there are some slippery characters among the bidders, you see.
every wig brings out a different style. it feels like a new challenge every time i try a different do!
what do you take me for? no self-respecting astrologist would dream of abusing their beloved art for such crude purposes. besides, it wouldn't be fair to the other contestants.
...my shoulders are sorer than usual, compared to my normal cleaning duties that is.
oh, right. i forgot to tell you, haha! it'll be fine.
if yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
alright. please proceed to the office. baishi will go over the work with you in more detail.
it's alright, i've got gepard with me -- we'll be safe. see you in a bit!
sorry. i couldn't hear you clearly. could you repeat that?
it's futile trying to escape. anywhere in the world you run to, it will be right behind your back. after all... you did summon it together.
of course not! who would press something like that!
hang in there a bit longer, reinforcements are on the way!
guests aren't allowed here, so we have to be careful not to get caught.
i believe it's also about time for me to take my leave. but hopefully i'll see you on set over the next few days -- even though my part's wrapped, i'd still like to swing by and help out the crew.
i didn't think many people liked that one... seems the city might have a few nice memories of me after i'm gone.
does my ability to see through your secrets so easily not evoke any memories?
that should do it. i vividly remember everything that occurred on penacony. ask away.
so, in return, i agreed to perform a divination for him.
hey! would it kill you to play along?
alas, the pretense of your tyranny has shattered. with that, a magnificent hunt shall be set in motion!
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape.
the tenryou commission presides over domestic military affairs. if they ever had any intention of concealing information in their reports, we would have no way of knowing.
anything special about that name?
as one who is thrown into the sea, though he fights back desperately against his predicament, it does nothing to prevent his descent into the depths.
want to keep chasing after it? you're not feeling worn out yet?
...i ended that man's life, alone.
uh, that can't be right...
i hate to admit it, but the "harmony" in this place resonates more broadly than within the sweet dream...
i know... but it's still a shame, don't you think?
even if you get past the restricted zone in one piece... you'll have a whole heap of fragmentum to deal with.
a guy from the distant past with a burning ambition to scale the highest mountain... i'd be willing to bet that he was an adventurer, just like you.
yes... there are too many important things to take care of...
i know cocolia's style -- get everyone into a frenzy first.
hmm... simple ingredients, easy to cook, helps you rally...
just like you said, from now on, i'm going to treat helping people with smaller tasks as a part of my training!
i'm comforted to know that you didn't lose your heads amidst the hype, and you're not just in this to have some fun. unfortunately though... it appears that we're about to be interrupted.
that's not the case. if people are to live with dignity, there must be nothing and no one above them.
they are as follows: sunset vermillionite, wonder cores, and adepti sigils.
huh, i wouldn't go that far.
stripped of ambitions, stripped of the potential for change, it does nothing more than simply... exist. it is a hollow shell of a nation.
mighty light of the heavens, wolf in my heart, come to me... we shall conquer as one!
therefore... i shall allow you to leave tenshukaku alive
hehe, please allow me to learn from your skills.
so, what brought you here? you don't look like you're a fan of these monkeys.
i don't have to fight all of them... right? the master diviner was easy-peasy, but i don't think i could take general jing yuan...
it's nothing, it just feels like people are getting along better since your unannounced disappearance...
come on. let's go down to the docks.
lil' geppie... so grown up now... looking down on his civilian sister...
by the way, in those immersia stories, the swordmasters always hide their true strength before a decisive battle.
huh? i wouldn't go that far -- i only had dad to deal with. he could be fierce, but nothing like the monsters here.
we met some stowaways in the residential area. most of them came from neighboring star systems.
well anyway, i'll be right here if you change your mind!
of course. i've heard that most humans like desserts, so it's not unusual that i should enjoy them too. miko agrees with me on this.
if we hadn't happened to be passing by... were you really planning to go into the fragmentum alone?
i took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
visions are a seal of approval for those who are most ambitious. as for my own ambitions, they shall remain private for now. it is nothing more than an insignificant dream.
i wasn't expecting to receive vip shrine visitors during down time. hehe, so i suppose you're here just to visit me?
but before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
i didn't even finish what i was saying...
please have a good rest. come to the jade chamber when you have recovered your energy.
...huh, still no improvement in her mood, even after all this time away from the group.
do you feel okay telling me why you had to come here, despite the risks?
and that's why we have the honorary knight to rely on, in times of trouble...
well, things are getting lively. we've barely recovered from the family's charmony festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
...did you really have to add that last part!?
this should fill in the empty spaces in the puzzle.
...it's okay, i've thought it through... if it were up to me, i'd... sign the contract.
no one knows where it came from. it just blew up overnight. fans made up bananese that only fellow fans would understand, and even created sticker packs and fan works!
still, i want to at least give it a shot. even though the information's vague, can you help us at all?
also, that little fairy on your backpack is super cute, too.
the fact that... i can't always be as strong as everyone thinks i am.
that dan heng -- he can't just ignore bronya...
there's something on its right hand, stay alert!
i mean, we needed an excuse for your behavior anyway... surely insanity counts?
huh? so you could see through my guise? oh. i thought my impression was accurate enough.
i've been traveling back and forth between various star systems, and i rarely get the opportunity to really see this vast universe.
it doesn't matter! anything can happen in a dream, and there are lots of people falling from the sky every day. the pedestrians aren't going to be fazed by anything.
the tenryou commission... if only they weren't so overzealous, there might be a way...
right now, we might be able to handle things if it's just the doomsday beast. but, if the destruction's emanator were to appear...
next time, why not remind me before i give up my name?
but my predictions can't be mistaken... well, let's make sure. your mother's name is alice, isn't it?
since welt has decided to travel with you, it means that he trusts you, and we trust his judgment.
i don't wanna get to the end so soon... i want my journey to go on forever.
but i'm already very happy that i get to visit your express like this once in a while.
so now, i've understood the meaning of my second "death", and i am prepared to face it. if all goes well, my efforts will provide crucial support for you.
before, the thought of wearing a fancy dress on the stage of the exhibition match had me worried. i was concerned about whether i would be presentable enough to meet the audience's expectations.
it just seemed like you were a bit preoccupied today, and much less talkative than usual. you barely said anything other than "is that so?" and "indeed".
by the way, were there any special stalls at youkai festivals in the past?
to me, it's because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
even if i don't know drunken swordplay, i've got other tricks up my sleeve!
as for tracking down the thief, i'm afraid it'll be a long-term project. when the time comes, we may need your assistance again.
what's this box for? why don't you open it, general huaiyan?
we've passed the test, but we ought to hurry up... the stellaron is at stake.
hehe... "the birds are chirping, the weather's so nice, watch me roll six pyro dice!" director hu of the wangsheng funeral parlor is ready for battle!
actually, no -- forget that. far more trouble than it's worth.
there's nothing there.
i see. well, when you put it that way... looks like we'll hold onto it for now. what do you think, mister giovanni?
...but that's only a small part of his story. believe me when i say he has more experience than i do.
come to think of it, i didn't even get a chance to formally introduce myself...
that's why it's so important to develop close connections with your teammates.
mister alois, please accept this souvenir.
oh, speaking of which, may i ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
you're afraid... afraid to accept that the fungus you treated as a pawn now trusts you completely. because then you'll be forced to face your true feelings, which you have been trying so desperately to escape from.
no, please don't worry. i actually feel relaxed and even a little joyful at the moment.
mm, dreams can be both good and bad... because the outcome is uncertain, dreams still cannot heal everything...
if i didn't make any money in the morning, i'd have no food for lunch. i guess that's why i came to be so obsessed with mora.
i am ningguang, tianquan of qixing. you wish to trade? you be my personal bodyguard, and i will show you how to get ahead in liyue.
i--it's bigger than i thought... hey you, i was just joking! leave us alone, shoo!
nice! you guys are pretty handy -- you picked that up in no time. wanna be my assistants? average pay, but i'm a good boss.
it's hard to believe that someone like him could be captured by the cloud knights and that the stellaron hunters would look to us for help.
so, even if it seems small to you -- you did a very great thing here.
during this time, i also resisted buying hardcover copies of research manuscripts... eventually, i had saved up enough.
the express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for me!
it's possible... but if that were the case, other life forms would surely be drawn to the meteorites' energy too.
i take no issue with it. in any case, the assistant hasn't done much in the way of assisting.
well? feeling less worried now?
don't try and get me to cook. i can take care of anything else, but not that.
chasing and waiting -- maybe that's what life's all about...
hehe, but i'm not an actress. sir kamisato and lady ayaka are the real actors here! i'm just tagging along with ayaka to have a good time together.
it has always been our wish to make everyone happy, so... we'll do our best to explain everything to the dreammaster. i'm sure he'll understand.
"the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen"...
bronya invested so much just to make this world a little better. and now, it feels like all of her efforts will be undone in the blink of an eye. it's just so cruel...
but there is no urgency. to reach an ill-conceived verdict in haste, just for the sake of having reached one, would be a confusion of priorities.
y--you are dan heng, right? what's with the horns...?
admirers... how come we don't get cool nicknames!
it's more or less the same as i remember before.
now that we've enjoyed this tableful of delicacies, how about we let our one and only chef here do the honors?
you know... i--i'm still a little worried about how bea is doing...
(i wonder if luocha has something prepared for this moment...)
you may not have the courage to challenge me, but i trust that you are capable of attending to a small matter such as this.
people who are easy to get along with make friends wherever they go.
come now, it wouldn't do any good to be sarcastic.
...i should've known. that sounds like seele alright.
i'm sorry, master diviner! when himeko found me in the ice, i was stark naked -- like a newborn baby. i didn't have any items with me...
afterwards, we went swimming at the beach! well, diving to be exact... it was the first time i ever breathed underwater!
there are also all kinds of smaller domestic tasks, like preparing captain kaeya's eye patch, and helping ms. lisa keep her bookshelves in order.
i--i used to live here... b--before the architects took me away, before madam cocolia adopted me... i used to live here! i'm... an undergrounder.
there we'll meet a special someone who will tell you more about your tasks.
isn't it dangerous for them to make camp right under svarog's metal nose?
i have faith in you. however, before we depart, there is one more thing i must tell you.
...master jean!? how could i ever become someone great like her?
when evil people do evil things, they always have a myriad of excuses to try and justify their own actions.
hmm? are you trying to make me feel better?
"nestling by a roaring fire, scent of tea wafts from the stove, reading through the heart of clear springs."
but article two of the knights of favonius handbook also says that one must not offend our visitors, right?
march seventh, a young beauty from the astral express!
would you mind putting in a word for me, kazuha? i'm a long-time fan of captain beidou's. i've always hoped i'll get to make friends with her some day, but so far i've never had the chance.
or someone will see the mist spirit, and not manage to catch it, but because they angered it, it'll never show itself again.
...and on that note, i'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to a few guests of the city.
i just looked up some tips on the interastral network -- these victory zones are leased by the ipc and the gaming association from various planets. the ipc's reach is impressive...
i thought folks in mondstadt would still like to go there...
so. what's item one on today's schedule?
that's the reason i asked for you to come here. i need your advice.
little diting says he's been dutifully searching for clues all over the xianzhou. he notified us as soon as he found something strange.
hey, that's actually a compliment i don't want to hear!
it looks like i wasn't supposed to be privy to the contents of this particular meeting. this simplifies things.
"soul shines like jadestone, dressed in finest silkwear, lucent heart still beats within me now."
we'd better hurry to the underworld and see what natasha and seele make of it all...
she spends all her time alone. having a visitor once in a while can't do any harm.
here we go again... but no big deal, we're pretty handy with this bazooka now.
in other news, my scryglass seems to be working fine now. the divination results are also looking about right, although...
you're quite welcome. it's truly what a good opera deserves.
look at how full of life you are! must've slept like the dead last night, huh?
sorry, i'm not quite sure either... ipc tech is pretty complex -- there are some principles i'm still trying to wrap my head around.
but there are so many of them in that friendship group, and i don't remember anything from that age anyway. so i never have a clue who they are.
i suppose with smaller goals, i won't be disappointed day-to-day... since the larger goal is so high, i couldn't hope to achieve it immediately.
although the bloodhounds mistook me for a stowaway, i'm actually a local. my name is firefly, and i'm from the iris family. i work as a stage performer, although right now i'm just an extra...
wow, that's a pretty incredible story. so... does that mean topaz's "business" here is to collect a debt from belobog?
well, why don't we ask him after we've taken down the great mujina youkai!
you don't need to individually greet everyone... so, are you also here for the class, miss rappa?
when that happens, they will be ready to face the world head-on and become exceptional businessmen and women. but until then, i am here to protect them.
that's a tough one, alright... there's plenty more besides memories held in the ley lines.
look up there... if we can push that thing down, do you think that would do the trick?
...my name is firefly. i'm a stage performer from the iris family.
you two have my thanks. you have done much for me, and i will never forget it.
i give up -- i'm just going to divine the answer.
the express is traveling on a route that the trailblazer once embarked on. the names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at pegana -- akivili's home world.
haha, well... they do sound like... a brave soul...
whatever the case, why don't we go to sumeru city?
i closed my eyes, held my breath, and clenched the dice tightly in my hand as i prayed for the blessings of all my supporters in the audience -- both visible and invisible! wink wink!
that's right. how do you get rid of the next big thing? you replace it with the next next big thing.
you needn't worry. the leader of watatsumi island took some troops to clear the place out. she's also issued a strict ban on the use of delusions across the whole army.
are we... jumping down from here?
i've seen a lot and it's made me think a lot... i really can't praise it highly enough. i hope i will remember it for a long time to come.
remember how i was saying that the meteorites belonged to someone's constellation?
then again, i suppose your frankness is part of your charm.
don't underestimate the talents of the craftspeople in hanamizaka. to the naked eye, their counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine article.
*sigh* was it that obvious? i'm out of practice...
what are you waiting for!? hurry up or they'll start getting suspicious!
yeah, we took care of it -- provided food and water, and groomed its feathers. and later... when i decided to leave penacony, i opened the cage and set it free.
it is for these reasons that i have come here to the luofu today.
spices supreme... check out that sign. here it is!
oh? hopefully not because there's been some sort of cataclysmic event?
he wanted to go investigating on his own, so i let him~
the atmosphere in this room feels totally different.
declining would be like admitting defeat! of course i'll accept it!
of course, the role of the "martial artist" goes to the winner of the competition, and the "divine familiar" will be fulfilled by a true swordsman, a role also known as the "archon's emissary."
that puppet was built with technology that has been lost to time. perhaps she, as a god, is the only one privy to the knowledge of its origins...
hah. it's my shrine. if i say you're qualified, then you're qualified.
i see... though your attempts may fail, you will not give up future attempts because of a temporary setback.
it's possible. many mysteries lurk beneath the surface of this world.
uh... you want us to help you? what do you need?
allow me to demonstrate. watch closely now.
unfortunately, given that said antagonist is under the protection of two commissions and the raiden shogun, we would be rather hard-pressed to track them down.
sorry, i don't mean to put any pressure on you. i was just, well... how should i put it? simply, i...
i bet you think he's pretty entertaining. watch out, or he'll fool you!
hehe, they were all very ambitious types, and each had their own knack for doing business. one by one, they left, until kouichi was the only one of them remaining in inazuma.
it had such a unique taste and every bite was so sumptuous, before i realized it, i had finished the entire plate...
connect worlds together, carving an endless path.
so. what does dodoco do after getting to inazuma?
shh -- this technology hasn't been made public yet. it was originally planned to debut at the charmony festival, but it seems it's been leaked.
that intellitron had been auctioned off a dozen times, and i participated in his thirteenth. that was the grandest banquet i had ever attended, but never again did anyone cast another glance at him.
ms. yun is such a strict mentor! these breaks aren't even long enough to have a sip of tea.
haha, it's a champions' welcome!
unpopular? what are you talking about? who in aurum alley wouldn't like a cheerful and adorable young lady like me?
perhaps clockie has a hidden past.
you know i would never do such a thing...
however, i did once get amber to teach me how to make baron bunnies!
since the moment it was built, the grand theater has graced the entire dreamscape with its rendition of the odes of harmony.
thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. now the express is relying on you to get it moving again.
oh? hello there, little ones.
is this a sacrifice that you are willing to make?
*sigh* that's our dan heng -- always trying to look cool with his poker face. don't mind him~
for your firm commitment to enforcing the rules, you have my admiration, too.
there must be another lamp hiding around here somewhere...
i'm fine, really. i just got into a few skirmishes down in the underworld, but nothing i couldn't handle.
yeah! what about windrise?
geez... i can barely even hear myself think!
we are entrusted by the people to loyally see out their wishes. wangsheng funeral parlor is special, in that it carries a dual responsibility, to those both of this realm, and the next.
oh, mister ryuunosuke is making them right now. you can go collect them from my house later.
as it happens, i was just having a discussion on backup plans with my secretaries before you arrived.
resting? booooring!
this is a small gift prepared by the iris family for the guests -- there's one for you too. please open it at the charmony festival for an unexpected surprise!
she also appears to be standing right behind you.
because the almighty shogun decided to convey her skills and the will to protect the citizens of inazuma through the form of martial arts, the duel was then aptly named warrior's spirit.
mother never asked a single thing of you. all she wished was for us to live a peaceful life, just like the others.
but... general huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. is he really a xianzhou general?
now, penacony as you hoped, has welcomed the dawn after a long, dark night. the path forward may not be a bed of roses, but at least people are prepared to step forth towards freedom.
it's been lit for so long now that the incense is running out. i'll leave refilling and lighting the incense to the most distinguished guest among us all.
svarog? that name sounds familiar...
after you have mastered these, i will impart more of the secret wonders hidden deep within this world.
i suppose i'm not worried as long as everyone doesn't get too excited. alright then, let's get going.
but look where i am now. standing on the deck of the jade chamber once more, taking in the view... it must be fate's reward to me.
but if i had to guess, it's probably because she hasn't been able to explore the city for quite some time...
as for how it was built and how it was damaged, i do not have an answer.
i don't deserve your curiosity. loners wandering the cosmos always have their secrets. take me. i'm wanted by the ipc, so it's little wonder that i know something about the stellaron hunters... that's all.
oh, has night fallen already? then you'd best go have a rest.
and i am noelle, maid of the knights of favonius... of course, i am not yet an official knight.
he wasn't lying. there's actually a bazooka here.
i'm sure you'll have a great time. don't forget to send my regards to the supreme guardian while you're there.
...and yes, things are going well for me too -- thanks for asking!
...yeah, i really like them, so what.
we also defeated an ancient robot known as "svarog," and learned some truths... about the stellaron.
did we do something wrong? we really did save the luofu, so why do you want to sneak off like we're fugitives?
there are many types of people called "heroes," and he is among the most genuine... i have seen many such people come and go.
now, it seems like she was right, while i took the wayward path.
...looks like it's coming to an end again.
there were so many paths here, and they're all twisty-turny and up and down... it's hard navigating through them all.
you know, it's weird. welt noticed it too, about how miss robin's voice sounded somewhat weary... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it was different than usual?
*sigh* ...perhaps, in the eyes of a deity such as the almighty shogun, the lives of those who inhabit the world are inconsequential...
i know that, gepard. don't worry, i've thought this one through for a change.
asta, i don't think arlan is upset with you.
looking at it now, she seems to be a classic case of a "wrong path" character. blames the many for the mistakes of a few, and seeks to wipe them all out of existence...
no way, i won't let him off the hook, because i'm despicable, remember?
have you ever seen a fireworks show, mister morris? it's pretty amazing!
hmm, the family assigns every student their major? doesn't sound very "harmonious" to me.
haha, but seeing as you stumbled upon me, you aren't far from finding that person now.
ugh, seriously! i was in such a good mood, too, until they came along and spoiled it...
...dan heng, wanna... talk about mister yang's findings?
(oh, almost forgot about that title page... he took it with him, so it must have had some significance.)
patrolling the streets is the tenryou commission's job. the shogun has a lot of information to process and orders to give out. she doesn't have time to deal with it herself.
then i'm on board! thank you for your kindness, general huaiyan.
can't hide it anyways, penacony is plastered with our posters... and because the astral express is so well-known, the family won't dare to make any rash moves.
sure. oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. i hope as an onlooker i may provide some help.
pleasure to meet you, miss topaz. i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
impossible. astrology can see through all lies -- you've seen it yourself.
the final trial of the mappou age... destroy the matrix of osaru's house and end the catastrophe that has befallen this land.
what strong names! greetings, ninja ruri and ninja hiryu!
i believe the sweet dream will see its rebirth, just like the radiant feldspar resumed its voyage.
as i suspected. it's the embodiment of the family, the edifice that first materialized within the sweet dream... that's what turned penacony into its current state.
looks like a light cone. didn't that weird voice in the matrix say something about a parting gift? i guess this is it.
hey there, clara! huh? is svarog not around?
traveler, have you decided on your wish?
serval, you seem to know more about aether spirits than us -- can you tell us what's up with this little guy?
thus he became known as the father of penacony.
whenever i encounter something unexpected, i can't think straight... and whenever i start worrying that i might fail again, my mind goes completely blank...
ugh, what a nuisance! well, you've only got yourself to blame!
ah, it has been some time since i've attended a festival... fortunately, i brought sake with me.
as soon as i saw fischl, i realized that the mirage that's about to take shape here must have something to do with her.
i think he's referring to that machine.
so go forward -- to the end of your journey, and to the ends of this world!
do you know about constellations? astrologers believe that the patterns of the stars map out the destiny of vision bearers -- past, present, and future, everything is written in the stars.
oh? well what did you want to ask?
...it looks like they really thought this machine would benefit the fatui.
but still... this motivates me to work harder and look forward even more to the day when it finally comes...
i used to think that she simply didn't care, but looking at it now, perhaps the problem all along has been with the tenryou commission's reports to the shogun.
i would like to know how you make such delicious desserts.
to visit an important potential client. i'll lead the way.
long, long ago, there was a little child who suddenly turned up at the shrine one day.
really? are you doing this on purpose?
look around you. the grass grows green and lush and a soft breeze blows. this is inazuma at peace, as you will no doubt remember.
you saw it all for yourselves. i'm sure you can figure out what kind of spirit had possessed him, can't you?
that's certainly part of it. but every bidder will have noticed that none of these items have a particularly high going rate on the market in and of themselves.
everything i have encountered on this journey with you has been from beyond my existing sphere of knowledge.
she liked pretty kimonos, she wanted to try food from different places, she yearned to see sights she'd never seen before...
don't mention it. i found a way to deal with your fears this time, but i can't do it over and over again, so i'd appreciate it if you try not to give in to superstitions in the future.
heh, you will understand how useful these are once you try.
the plane of euthymia. essentially, the world inside her mind. a place that typically only allows her existence.
the invitation was sent quite early on. i don't think anyone expected fontaine to be in this much trouble.
with every previous set, there has always been some degree of commercial or marketing considerations to bear in mind. but this one serves more of a commemorative purpose.
...okay, deal. we're not gonna solve anything by keeping jialiang here.
let us worry about the antimatter legion. you just follow us and keep yourself alive~
for my brother, orders are more important than anything. even if you stuck bronya's letter to his forehead, he wouldn't be swayed.
the exit's over there... how do we get to it?
...well, since it's recommended by the honorary knight, then... i have to give it a try.
indeed. no longer will i ignore their passions and dreams.
wow... the architecture here is so unique, and there are so many people around... but somehow, i feel like i'm constantly being watched...
look at the time. the anniversary celebration's opening ceremony should be starting soon. let's go see the dean.
each ninja hero has their own prey. silvergun shura only came to repay a favor, after which he returned to his own hunt.
i must give him a chance, seele, because other people can't.
if you encounter any difficulties on your travels, feel free to tell me all about them.
it was only after talking to himeko that i learned that jarilo-vi isn't the only planet suffering from the stellaron's calamity. the number of worlds that endured such a fate far surpasses what we imagined...
your archmage megistus thanks you for your kindness, your highness. in this moment, i offer my blessings to the immernachtreich.
just a strange feeling. i had it a few stops ago, but it's super strong this time.
i can't think of a reason anyone would want to build a structure like this deep in the mountains.
distinguished guests, fellow family members, ladies, gentlemen and friends from all over the cosmos --
i'm not asking about that! although, you're not wrong...
you've already met junkichi and shigeru.
you're comparing apples and sunsettias there. whenever beidou returns to liyue harbor, all she brings me is a headache.
so be careful what you say when you collect the keepsakes!
"stillness of mind, freedom from all agitation"... what a fine notion that would be, if any in this world could ever hope to achieve it...
however... there's a problem that needs to be resolved before it can open to the public.
living in a world like that would be a dream come true!
we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
okay, i wasn't expecting that...
it's a bit of a mouthful, but i liked it at the time... it was a rock 'n' roll name.
attachment, desire, longing... they may all be right, but they are all incomplete.
wh--what's that look for!? ...you're not leaving already are you? c'mon, don't go -- i promise they don't taste that bad! and i promise, it's not a prank!
the flow of turbulence may well have been influenced by makoto. but it took everyone's efforts combined to ultimately help ei. so this time, it looks like thanks are due to you.
now then, tell me what you found out about readers' preferences.
ugh, some people just never listen, do they? it's never-ending. it just goes on and on... i'm getting really tired of this.
i may not be as efficient as master jean, but i will do my very best to help you find it!
there's nothing but... a jigsaw puzzle here.
to do something like that... she must have a real sweet tooth.
there's just no way that svarog's calculations would have included variables like us, y'know?
that's what most people tend to think. but i've studied astrology for a very long time, and i know a few things about them that you might not.
hmm, that actually does feels like something he would say...
...i see. i genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world.
masters could handle them for sure! but isn't it asking too much of a poor little rookie like me?
does this "true taste" have anything to do with that mikhail?
because it's always more fun to enjoy a festival with friends, isn't it?
they are also followers of qlipoth, but what they do is drastically different from us architects. can businessmen honestly support the preservation? i'm seriously doubting their true motives...
the more i think about it, the more embarrassing it seems.
i don't know the details. she said she wanted to rest, and i have nothing pressing that requires her attention. so there is no reason to disturb her.
pops, are you alright? they didn't do anything to you, did they?
haha, judging by how much fun everyone's having, i'd say probably not until well after midnight.
so, uh, what are we supposed to be doing?
that's fine. since it's something that took place in inazuma, it might actually be more interesting to readers if it's grounded in the truth.
hmph, you do it next time -- i'm tired of being the villain.
in the end, the lantern rite planning was left to keqing and myself. i am the head organizer, while keqing is responsible for the highly anticipated fireworks show.
simply put, there will always be work to do.
let me guess, the gate isn't working?
it's fair to say that very little time passed between the moment you came out of that realm and the moment you re-entered it. but in that same time, centuries of battling took place on the inside, did it not?
i once met an adventurer on a mountain who also happened to be picking fruits. he was even kind enough to share some with me.
i know how you feel, clara. you want new hope for the underground, but you don't want anyone to get hurt in the process, right?
did you find gossipmonger? what did she say?
the vision hunt decree is a trap. part of a fatui plot to bring inazuma to its knees.
it looks like i was still able to help those in need.
plus that's where we parked the astral express! don't you worry, we'll protect you from the monsters and clear up this mess.
yay! that's my favorite part... wait, no, my favorite part is watching the aurora!
you could say that. i need to see the crack first before deciding what to do next.
huh? the ipc are causing trouble in the underworld? already?
oh... so you mean i should focus on smaller steps in order to achieve a larger goal?
please come this way. let me show you something interesting.
you can see guyun stone forest from here, i trust? it is no natural rock formation -- those are giant spears of rock, hurled by rex lapis during the war.
it seems i'm the one who came out on top this time, hehe. i'm actually quite enjoying myself... how about we go for another round?
hmm... you really think i shouldn't limit myself to mondstadt?
the moment that blades are crossed in battle also becomes a kind of eternity. i shall use this moment to feel your inner being.
bye-bye now. come again soon.
if the second floor is filled with customers, perhaps i'll have the opportunity to overhear a thing or two?
we've been disconnected from the rest of the universe for far too long, but i really believe the festival could be our chance to reconnect with other worlds again. it's important as a host that i make all guests feel welcome.
hehe, i suppose so. once they're done writing the manuscript, i'll write the passage where the protagonist recites the incantation myself.
anyway, that's besides the point! the point is, what are the ipc doing here on jarilo-vi?
all the literature, furniture, and ornaments i had collected followed the original jade chamber to its watery grave...
who i am, where i'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "march seventh" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
you're sure it's not a ghost or spirit of some kind?
doesn't look too bad, how did you make it?
there are so many members of the bloodhound family around here...
every year, when the fireworks go off, i say to myself, "another year has already passed."
let's move out then! but... where do we start looking for him?
i don't know much about my life story... but i do have extraordinary skills!
once you find the hope in your heart again, that happiness will come back to you.
heh-heh, i've already procured special invite tickets from miss robin's fan club!
pelageya sergeyevna, silvermane guards intelligence officer, at your service. you can call me pela.
by a mere one-vote margin, xiangling.
thanks for your suggestion, but i think i'm more suited to be an intelligence officer... besides, i can't just drop my work and go travelling...
i thought so too. it's most likely some rule of penacony's, or the family's.
that's right. and sometimes, festivals sell international food. she wanted to try that, too.
mother wrote that she'd always wanted to go to a local inazuman festival. she said that sometimes, on a clear night, if you looked out from our house, you could see lights off in the distance.
never. and although my mother and father passed away many years ago, both my brother and i are familiar with the vast majority of their acquaintances.
thanks for your help. also, well, i'm very sorry, but i won't be able to do what i agreed to help you with just yet.
ah, sorry, i'll take the little ones away right now.
that said, i would like to pay a certain place a visit before we go.
did he... succeed?
well, you didn't say no, so i'll count that as a yes.
so i guess now, the kids' impression of the great mujina youkai is mostly influenced by me.
the events of five hundred years ago not only robbed me of my friend, kitsune saiguu... they also took makoto away from me for good.
hello, mister cyrus. are you working on the exam syllabus? how is it coming along?
if so, then you underestimate me. i am quite well-informed about the vision hunt decree.
they invariably adopt a stance of unconditional support for the shogun's decisions. they have no interest in discussing anything.
perhaps you'll be the first guest to meet the dreammaster in years, mister yang.
you have mountains, and bodies of water, food and fun, and everything to like!
you seem familiar -- is this where you come to avoid doing work?
y'know, the more i look at this statue, the less "dan-hengy" it gets...
i guess it's time to tell the story of that "mikhail."
hmph, i'm angry just thinking about it. looking back, i'm glad i left home early.
wait, you didn't take all that vengeful god's curse stuff seriously, did you? they were eradicated ages ago!
but we have to bring her back to sumeru city first. her mother must be worried sick.
as the marshal's special envoy, i'll dispatch the luofu cloud knights to pursue hoolay myself.
twenty thousand...!
that's right. even at this price, there is no shortage of people willing to pay for a lunch opportunity with me.
the underwater world in fontaine truly is beautiful. i loved seeing the romaritime flowers blossoming underwater, like little candles lighting up the streets at night.
well, they won't look much better if you get caught by the tenryou commission...
these ambitions have transcended space and time. they are something that no one can snuff out.
no need to hurry. our deal is hardly the urgent matter here. atoning for your transgressions is the main order of business.
but i don't think that's a bad thing. like i always say, fireworks are for now, but friends are forever.
hehe, because now that you have done the three things i asked of you, i consider you to be my friends. as you will observe, i dispense with the screen for thoma, also.
the poll error is something that only the competition organizers are aware of. the public didn't seem to notice anything wrong with the ballots.
the duties i perform will not change.
hiding? i don't think i'd be capable of that in front of a memokeeper.
the longest-serving general of the xianzhou luofu. do you think he'd have only a few enemies?
what are you talking about? the main thing here is to use this chance to prove the power and status of astrology!
uh... i get what you're saying, but...
he won't budge, huh? looks like it's just the two of us then.
that's right... we're still waiting for mister giovanni's mysterious elite player to show herself.
gosh, the atmosphere here is so creepy and unsettling...
this projector is a limited-edition version custom-made for the museum -- the only one of its kind in the whole of belobog. it can produce images with a resolution of up to...
not at all, just doing what you asked. how about we call it even as payment for the healer lady's consultation?
ah! yes, yes, -- snowman's palm! ugh, my memory is the worst.
adventure? aha, you must hail from the adventurers' guild.
the sweet dream's collapse... that memokeeper mentioned the same thing. so, it's real.
no, no, no one asked. please do not subject us to your gushing about your girlfriend.
by the time i turned around, the person had already vanished. so i handed it over to a nearby hound. i heard there were many similar reports before the charmony festival started.
the hero who slays the dragon becomes the next dragon... the sacred sword that once fought the darkness now becomes a doomsday weapon...
so what you're saying is, the device affected us differently because we are different from the fatui?
you say that... but do i see your ears saying otherwise?
haha, look at you all, you've already gotten really close.
hmm... let me think of a way to repay you somehow.
oh? what's the matter? why are you two so silent...? is there something wrong with the outfit?
well, no one has ever asked me this before, so i've never really settled on an answer.
while i'm idling time on admiring the scenery, the spectacled snake-bedecked doc's doing surgery...
i am gradually getting used to this... who knows, i might even be able to perform some high-level moves with hanu.
huh, me? sure. um, sorry, wait here for a moment. we'll be right back.
please teach me, honorary knight! how do you normally train?
okay, here we go... eh-heh, explaining a theory in front of everyone is a more nerve-wracking than i expected.
haha! were you seriously hoping that the director of the wangsheng funeral parlor was going to start healing people? or...
yeah, yeah, yeah -- so i'm a layman. why don't you enlighten me, oh connoisseur?
hmm? oh, i'm just a tourist. as far as i'm aware, i don't have the authority to detain anybody within sumeru's borders... is that not the case for you, too?
i was simply stating the facts, not complimenting anyone.
hee-hee, in that case, come with me to naganohara, we'll go see my pops! there're still a few fireworks to finish off before the show.
and besides, it's a great opportunity to reintroduce inazuma to all teyvat through light novels. as they say, it's two birds with one stone.
why are you being so polite? oh, and why's the city under curfew all of a sudden? has something happened?
hmm~ after seeing this special modification... i can't help but wonder, do all victory zones have a similar kind of setup?
then, your parents told me what happened between you when you were younger. once i'd heard the story, i realized that the firework meant something special to you both.
"miss serval..." clara is such a well-mannered kid! meanwhile, the architects' children are still calling me "auntie" and making me feel old...
but that can wait... judging from your expression, it seems like you have something you want to say to me, little one.
most of the time i'm either accompanied by family or staff. so everyone must have found it quite a surprise to see me taking you out for a meal...
there are all sorts of exhibits on display - paintings by famous artists, samples of the planet's crust... visitors can experience the essence of belobog's culture in just a few minutes' time.
that doesn't mean it won't work! the best method for relieving anxiety is the one that works, right?
yes. glad to make your acquaintance, mister morris. we've heard about the issues you've encountered with your financial situation, and genuinely hope that things have taken a turn for the better.
remember, train hard and relish every moment! the title awaits you!
you aren't getting any funny ideas, are you?
no, no, this is completely different.
the third child of the landau family, right? i've heard gepard mention her before, but i've yet to meet her. from what i've heard, "lynxy" -- as they call her -- is very smart for her age.
is there some matter of importance you wish to discuss with me?
good. let's give it our best. i look forward to fighting beside you.
simply put, this is about maximizing overall efficiency.
okay, story time. so, whenever kouichi brings one of his friends from the trade association to see me, they always mention how they used to play with me when i was a kid, or held me once as a baby, or something.
ahem... "tsubaki and i are the same person, and yet we are different. when i become tsubaki, i stop being kamisato kayo and become the most ordinary woman in the world."
so that was just a hallucination? huh, why do i feel kinda disappointed...
hahaha, i was only kidding -- just a joke.
okay, um... so something like a hilichurl mask or an arrowhead...?
but i think more importantly than that, everyone trusts us. if it wasn't for our customers, we wouldn't be able to stay in business.
we usually meet up here, but our personal cabins are in the next carriage.
*sigh* we shouldn't have trusted an amateur...
jade stone can be pawned off, but not everything can be used in an exchange. outside of life itself, there are more valuable things that i don't want to give up.
she became a completely different person when she took on the supreme guardianship. the convictions she once held, her enthusiasm... it was like they were drawn out of her by some mysterious force.
yes! this is the kind of atmosphere i live for, i absolutely love it!
i remember this one time when i was little, pops said he'd take me to the festival, but he was so busy with work that he forgot all about it.
once again, thank you for being kind to me. i wish you a great time in the dream, and i shall not interrupt your... date?
he said you were the most dashing person in penacony, how interesting.
if you encounter them in any other nations during your travels, be on your guard. they are more than just a commercial organization.
yes, it's a quadruple-sweetness sunsettia.
is your heart pounding? wanna go? hee-hee, then it's settled~
good idea! we can be his cheerleaders in the background.
oh, what a pity. i was rather looking forward to seeing his fluffy ears again.
the shrine maiden i tasked with cleaning up is just outside the shrine. you'll know her when you see her.
that's why we should care for the weak and support them as if their suffering were our own... that's what the odes of harmony have always taught us.
determined to preserve the world they love, the architects held on for hundreds of years. but as the fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
but... how did the author know about this?
stop deluding yourself. these new-found sword skills are not his, they belong to the spirit that has possessed him.
i actually thought you had cooked it all yourself...
some plants only grow in gloomier spots with ample moonlight. you ever seen any? oh, no? well, i'll have to show you next time.
i am a little hungry... but it's not a big deal.
observing humans' reactions and reading about their lives are what interest me most in this world.
huh? what's wrong with that? everyone around here knows the way i work...
i could do with a cup once we're done here...
bighead fiendling, educators impart knowledge, cultivate skills, and clarify doubts, but they must never deny any ninja initiate of their way of the ninja!
no matter how disgusting the dish, you gotta summon your trailblazing spirit and face it! not gonna lie though, jellied eels and himeko's coffee are pretty tough to stomach...
are we missing the forest for the trees here...? i always felt that aventurine's reasons for accusing miss acheron were highly subtle. can we believe him?
traveler, we're leaving. let's not waste any more of our time here.
that's right, the great mujina youkai has been getting pretty bold lately. it's even starting to trick people in broad daylight.
since then, every time i encounter an obstacle in my thinking, i find myself having the urge to spend some time in the outside world.
all that talk about making up for my losses was really just to console myself.
the plan said that if hoolay appears, the cloud knights will assemble and do everything they can to suppress him.
all of it exists within the border between the living and the dead, an ordinary place, really. the only special thing about it is that nobody really knows about it.
your school practices meikyou shisui art, does it not?
thank you for inviting me out. this trip has been quite eye-opening for me.
so in the vast majority of cases, the one he made tea for was the former electro archon... who was also my sister. raiden makoto.
this is what trailblazing is.
a bright moon aloft amid the vast, clear skies... moments like these are just perfect for writing poetry.
it sounds as if i'll have a good chance of running into something unexpected.
and more fashionably dressed, too... hey, is he about to leave? what about the girl in red?
although i should always lend a hand to anyone in need... it would be dishonest for me to pretend to be a real knight.
if we tear apart these kids' fairy tales now, what else do we have to tell them? that inazuma is locked down? all the grim tales of the vision hunt decree? i think it's a bit too early for all of that.
i understand. this must be master kucha's trial for me. he's testing my ninja skills of letting go...
i guess you've already started your business talks. we'll get out of your way if--
whenever i remember that feeling of disappointment, i stop being able to think about what kind of knight i could become...
take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. i'll have the alchemy commission healers see to you when they arrive.
i'm actually incredibly busy every day. it's just that... i always feel like something's missing.
...it's not like that. you're making this too complicated...
but now it seems... the root of the problem goes way beyond me. there are elements around me that don't align with the harmony... and losing my voice is just one of the signs of the sweet dream's collapse.
safe to say, were it not for my previous experiences in combat, my skills would not have been up to the challenge. i would most certainly have been defeated.
i could even make some muffins, grab some napkins, and make a picnic out of it... ohh, but would that just waste too much time...?
i was originally thinking of going with him, but he said he could manage it himself. he told me to go see the sights around fontaine and to enjoy the local culture.
in the meantime, i expect the takatsukasa clan to continue supporting the kujou clan as before.
he will experience a high fever, but it won't be fatal. remember, this is the price you pay.
...yes. exactly. very to the point.
hey, miss qingque, care to get involved!?
who could it be...? going to all this effort just to meet us?
somewhere close to "death," but not like the hell or underworld from the tales of old. this is just a place where the ley lines tend to go a little bit haywire.
i'm gonna get some rest after i've sorted these photos. don't stay up all night playing video games again!
if i were to give it a go, i'd make it...
i made some progress too. the miners here say they've noticed some people acting strangely recently - a few vagrants who almost never leave the great mine have suddenly started making trips to boulder town.
i'm not the kind of person who risks life and limb for any old reason.
it's been a smooth ride... almost too smooth for a heavily guarded mansion.
that's the friendliest thing i've heard since we arrived!
why would topaz come here? is she looking for something?
phew, finally... after all that, there's just one option left!
haha, love it, but i bet there's a lot of songs with that name. it sounds like something randy would play -- he's one of my favorite legendary guitarists. may he rest in peace...
that's why we went out in the first place... to buy her this flower.
you came out here to look for him and remember that friendship, no matter how difficult things got. isn't that right?
oh, i get it now. the last scene is all about singing the praises of the order.
hmm... captain kaeya would probably appear cordial and sincere as a means to convince his subject to lower their guard, would he not?
ridiculous. i've never lost a single swimming race in my life. bring it on! first one to run to the beach wins!
you don't have to go all polite on me. just remember to come when i invite you next time!
however, the three questions i posed earlier were not just for the nameless, but for you too, general jing yuan.
i understand! in the immersia, the disciple and the master share both honor and disgrace. if the apprentice fails, the master loses face, too.
twists? like the ones in those swordmaster novels? but i wonder what kind of unexpected twists i'll encounter...
elio can see his own future, and i can also "see" mine. he says that there is only one kind of destiny, but before i reach mine, i want to know what else i can do... this is my right.
"was it one's thoughts that drew him to my dreams? had i known it a dream, one would not have awakened." hehe, i love that poem.
additionally, the shogun has no need of recreation. there would be no need for her to come here just to pass the time or to relax.
hehehe... i wish you the best of luck. may you soon discover the truth behind it all.
don't believe me? let me tell you, cocolia and i shared a similar way of thinking back in the day.
hehe, i'm not an expert on tracking down the living. however, if you want me to summon someone from the other side of the "border"...
no worries, just thought you might be interested.
to use general jing yuan's favorite expression: "since i'm already here..."
i have observed liyue from the jade chamber for years -- every building and every tile is etched into my memory.
there's no need to say that... the beauty of music is its ability to resonate with people and stir up their imaginations.
ugh... i don't wanna see a bunch of marches roaming around the express! one of me is enough!
don't think you can deceive me with some poetic speech! there is no animal alive that would destroy a world so brutally. you are the foulest poison this cosmos has ever seen.
it is an honor to meet everyone.
i took you to the "border" and let you have a look around, didn't i? but based on your reaction, it seems like you didn't find what you're looking for. it's a pity, indeed.
parting with a friend like that is too sad, and she never wanted that to happen.
even so, himeko indicated that the source of stellarons remains mysterious, and there are no realistic ways to remove a stellaron's contamination.
i fulfill the request written on each tile to make sure our clients are satisfied with the service, no matter if it's an obituary, cremation, or funeral that they seek.
fifty mora is probably not quite enough...
well, we didn't get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top ipc executive!
that's just how we gauge our client's importance. we have four levels: "wicker," "bamboo," "wood," and "marble." the higher the grade, the better we'd like to get to know you.
...of course. my word is my bond. i said that i'd stand with you to the end, and i won't go back on that promise.
not that i'm surprised in the least, of course. it certainly matches the the tone of her diary... ahem, anyway! we should change the topic.
let me show you how to do it. it's going to be very dark at first, so you'll have to stay close to me.
you couldn't have advertised your guilty conscience more clearly if you'd tried.
little miss pink... what's that supposed to mean!?
well, what do you think about windrise?
i see. the purest ore...
i was just going to the festival venue to prepare the ikebana lesson, when i found a strange piece of paper on a flower stand.
because we're asking nicely? what's with the attitude?
i can't speak for everyone, but this is how i really feel.
oh please, this is a technology division issue. why would they tell you guys? come on, let us in already. if the heating system goes down in the middle of the night, are you gonna be responsible for all the frozen corpses?
i know, right? of course, my main reason is that i want to go and look outside inazuma, hehe.
...if i don't overcome my fear of the exam, i will just repeat the same mistakes over and over again...
...if so, i'm not sure "mighty" is the right word for these architects.
we've arrived. there's an elevator here, just like in the lobby. we should be able to reach our destination with it.
we could have had a nice, relaxing vacation, if all of this hadn't ended up occupying so much of our time.
there's no need to covet an illusory sky in dreams, because we have the right and the ability... to fly towards a broader horizon.
...when i was still one of the architects working in the scientific research division, i was researching the stellaron.
you've probably never seen what your planet looks like, right? i took this one. behold, jarilo-vi...
if that's the case, then we'll have to "practice" wishing a little.
that's right. this magnificent dream is built upon the stellaron and the countless sacrifices of many people.
fishing isn't the half of it. you'd be amazed at some of the odd jobs i've worked in my time.
i'm trying to find my own room too, and i heard a commotion here... so i came to take a look. luckily your door was open, or it could've gotten dangerous. that man looked like he was up to no good.
mm, you mentioned something about the "interastral tournament festival" -- what is that?
that's just the work of my subconscious mind...
it's not every day i get to infiltrate baizhu's lair. but alas, i didn't catch a single glimpse of her anywhere...
nameless ninjas? are you talking about the nameless? we have names, you know. i'm march seventh and he's dan heng.
performing "ecological reconstruction" on a planet carries inevitable risks.
thank you, master kucha. this is my greatest honor...!
though its definition escapes me, isn't this the answer that ordinary people look for their whole lives? a name that can be carved onto their tombstone.
aiya, forgive me, this is one of our new undertakers, meng. it's his first time working a funeral, so of course, he's afraid of his own shadow.
that's what friends are for, bronya! ...you don't sound like yourself. is something wrong?
yes, she was quite cryptic, but i suspect she means that there is still a way to turn things around. she didn't say when or what that would be, though, so...
*sigh* sometimes i practice over a dozen times before reporting to my superiors, but i still can't get it right...
it must be because you are here with me that i was able to complete the exam.
ahaha, you're too kind... wait, you're giving me a gift? shouldn't it be the other way round?
i will not allow any of you... to leave the skysplitter!
"what follows in these pages is the ordinary, everyday life of a regular person. nothing more, nothing less."
and shooting stars make people think of wishes because wishes carry people's brilliant hopes and expectations for the future.
actually, we've already met the watchmaker...
i just can't help but... feel a little attached -- even if they are only an aether spirit.
thank you, miss topaz. we're on our way to the hounds to verify some intel. perhaps you've had dealings with them?
so... ahem! did you get a d--date with quinn?
uhh... we're gonna see her right now? can i at least find a place to freshen up first?
but if this went on forever... would it get boring too?
apologies, i know that this is a lot to ask, but...
whoa, so we're like doctors diagnosing a patient right now!
huh? you mean idrila -- the one he wouldn't stop talking about? but... he said he'd find them... and fulfill his duty to protect them.
*sigh* looks like i... still have a lot to learn...
i cannot rest on my laurels. after all, i'm not even formally a knight yet. until that day, i must work even harder.
it's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. it was once quite popular during festivals.
the puppets are gathering around the frame. are they expecting us to enter it?
i heard this drink was once very popular in belobog. however, the advent of the eternal freeze brought harsh conditions, and the soil necessary to grow the coffee beans became extremely rare.
the first lot is a teacup from my personal collection. bids starting at ten thousand mora, that's ten thousand mora for the teacup.
ooh... seems pretty neat, don't you think?
according to the passenger list, the three people who got off were tiernan, legwork, and razalina -- the express's guard, mechanic, and surveyor, respectively. no supplementary details are available.
so it's... made up? what's the point of that? without being grounded in reality, how can the story be believable?
besides, my mother was always curious about outfits from other countries when she was alive. this time, i will be able to fulfill my mother's dream.
besides, if we fail to uncover what's really going on in this tournament, we simply leave haniyyah to her own devices... who knows what chaos might ensue.
forty-seven... forty-eight... forty-nine... fifty!
its formal name is the "mechanism energy hub." it's connected to all the energy lines -- i would've thought it covers the entire restricted zone.
we were just about to discuss the boards over here. they're related to our little helpers' tasks, so i'll let you give them a detailed rundown.
it's been thousands of years since the last time the express paid a visit. the data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
oh, him. um... we specially invited him to be our "anti-mujina specialist."
absolutely not. astrology is meant to be used to gain insight into reality and observe destiny itself. it's certainly not for such mundane affairs.
what's up here? some kind of toy?
how impolite of you to generalize it as such!
thank you, march. i'll assemble the ministers. let's meet up again here later.
oh, we're okay, i was just curious about the heater...
they're always in a hurry. the pace of life here is so fast! things are pretty busy in the overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.
of course not... but you're not planning on doing something like last time, are you?
that's true. i'd certainly hate to see anyone else try to con you.
i think we've narrowed it down a little further.
let's go to marjorie's store and see what's available.
did you talk about anything interesting before we started the meal? anything fun i missed out on?
it sure is... but at least we're here. once we seal the stellaron, they can get back to the good life.
anyway, thanks for the suggestions! they all have something about them. i'll have to think about it...
is this the right way? it looks like there's a roadblock up ahead.
this is the tea that mengming has made, especially named after you.
i told them that they could write their wishes down on paper, so i ended up collecting several dozens of wishes...
huh... do you think svarog and clara felt the effects of our battle with the guardian?
it's most likely the first time in history anyone has faced this issue. you can imagine how hard it must be, given that it has successfully flummoxed the wise and powerful ei...
the ipc soldiers are well-equipped -- it wouldn't be wise to fight them head-on. captain, what do you have in mind?
if i lose, i'll pay you twenty thousand mora. but if i win, then you'll be eating prison rations in liyue harbor tonight.
new challengers enter! about time, human-only conflicts are so boring.
...out of the question! as the curator of the exhibits here, i would never resort to deceiving the public like that...
the exit... is on the other side? how're we going to cross over...
"stars hung from its branches..." then how did it fit in the xianzhou!?
i'm super interested in xianzhou immersia and novels! even though i use a bow, almost all the great heroes in those immersia use swords, so i want to be a swordmaster too!
hey, what are you doing! you can't just throw trash... no way! the words on the note are changing!
what does that mean? it's just a picture. are we supposed to meet someone there?
this includes my brother as well. ena's dream... is too cruel for him, and everyone else.
true to the title of trailblazer, they spent their lives venturing into the unknown. but... what about this tablet? there are no names carved on it.
of course you should! why wouldn't you?
but i see what you're doing... reverse psychology, huh?
at present in inazuma, in the name of the vision hunt decree, the people's aspirations are being senselessly trampled underfoot.
wow, that's pretty great! i wish the photographers at my shows had your skills!
...by the way, there's one more thing.
this is your first mission, so don't mess it up.
cloud knights! the borisin have arrogantly decided to challenge us on xianzhou territory! they vow that they will unleash a bloodbath along the streets of the xianzhou.
hmm, that's true. anyway, since he asked for help, it's time to give those monsters a shock!
the important thing is not the format but the creative work itself. it is impossible to come up with anything fresh if you're stuck using some rigid format of the past.
do we have an agreement? well then. no backing out now.
yes, it feels like it's been ages since the last time i had some.
yes. acting in my own capacity, mind you. even then, there is no escaping the fact that my every action and word will be seen to reflect on the yashiro commission and the kamisato clan.
though i occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it -- i can't exactly avoid seeing it at the grand narukami shrine, after all -- my fate is intimately intertwined with the sacred sakura.
well... let's see. ah, yes -- a silvermane guard standard issue portable heater. i--it's broken, though.
my family has pretty good connections with the yashiro commission. we work very closely with them. and whenever there's a national event of any sort, the other two commissions come to us, too.
they've got loads of it down there. i just chipped off a tiny piece.
really? that feels like a messy order to me.
of course! i'm very fond of this city. there are so many novel and interesting things that it's been hard to keep track of them all.
i never expected pom-pom would be so distraught...
yes. at most, these items are only worth a couple of thousand mora.
it's nice to see you all again, astral express crew. i heard my disappearance caused quite the commotion out there... i'm really sorry about that.
well, i guess i can't get you the stars, or the moon. but pretty much anything else.
i'm afraid i can't intervene in an official capacity... but i can still help you get your lost goods back.
since our last negotiation, i've come up with a new proposal, which i think you'll find has far more benefits for you.
um... this gentleman is?
it's an ore -- a special energy resource. whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on geomarrow.
another chest, another hand print. has this woman got nothing better to do?
yes. swimming birds, flying squirrels, the sun and moon in the sky together... some of these sights only lasted for a moment, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre.
cut that racket out! i'm doing experiments here!
the essence of turn-based games lies in the numbers, so you'd better get ready to witness the precision of my calculations!
what should we exchange for it?... and who should we give our stuff to?
the express is... melting?
look! there's a crowd gathering over there. is the address starting soon?
still stable, i suppose. do you still remember the medic who saved me in battle?
the silvermane guards withdrew to the surface long ago... i must avoid that identity here.
the legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves -- this trip won't be a walk in the park. it's better if you have something to protect yourself.
as your stars move across the sky, they record all your life events in their path. and among all the people in the world, a considerable number will see their stars deviate from their path.
what you might not realize is that all too often... people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
let me be clear, the questions i'll ask might not reflect my actual thoughts. so, please don't take offense if any of my questions seem a bit harsh.
by the way, where is your general? didn't you say he would be joining you?
that wubbaboo back there seemed quite happy... it must mean we're doing something right.
*sigh* huh? what's that huge structure in the distance...
...though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
listen to yourself! that's how you want to be known? is your name just an appendix to the ipc?
venti and i have selected several riddles from everyone's contributions, and we added a few of our own to the mix for good measure. shortly, we'll randomly select a few to read aloud.
he has shown me how some things remain the same even as the world around them changes.
heaven and earth, rain and wind, the endless sky and the boundless land. forest boars and ocean shrimp, lavender melons and matsutake 'shrooms!
i wonder if qlipoth, the preservation, has ever glanced at us in the past seven hundred years -- even for a second.
*sigh* we're lucky that no one from the tenryou commission was around, otherwise, we'd all be in big trouble.
sorry, can you point me in the direction of the lobby? all these hallways really look the same to me...
on the contrary, we know it well.
why you...! get over here!
sure, you know i love to talk. let me think, is there anything interesting going on these days...
not always, sometimes it's a happier conclusion.
i had been thinking about a surprise reunion with you during our trip here... but you still managed to surprise me first.
nice work indeed -- you're sidekick to a genius detective after all!
cocolia... it's been so many years since we last spoke. we were great friends once -- there was nothing we wouldn't share.
i asked the silvermane guards stationed there to go investigate some places of interest. i hope they find something...
ha! i knew you'd say that. here, i've got a gift for you...
this may be an everyday occurrence for you. but for me, this trip has been quite an occasion.
fischl said there's something she wants to investigate, and suggested that we all go ahead in the meantime. she told me not to worry, she'll catch up with us when she's done.
don't treat me like a new recruit. i'm all too familiar with the monsters of the fragmentum. let's get ready to fight!
eh, it's just a novel -- who knows if something like that could happen in reality. i thought of it as soon as i saw this footage, though.
hand them to sara. she can examine them for herself.
miss topaz, what brings you here? do you also play aetherium wars?
it's the stellaron hunter girl... i can see her on the big screen, but where is she in the arena?
hmm... i can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
it was by chance that i happened to be born into the naganohara family, so it was by chance that i ended up learning this craft from my pops.
norbert's position is indeed an idle one -- it's no wonder he has time to socialize with members of the limestein family.
mm... don't give me that look. it's just a game after all, and having fun should be your main concern.
anyway, there's something else i wanted to talk to you about -- there's been a new development in the museum theft case.
hmm, let me see... which sword is the most powerful? single sword? greatsword? or maybe a flying sword?
according to the survey results, the stellaron is likely to the north of belobog... somewhere in the vast snow plains.
at this point, i would normally lecture you on the dire consequences of using occult methods to obtain power that does not belong to you... but i think you get the picture now, don't you?
it was you. i saw you opening treasure chests, hitting balloons, and playing the dreamy slots. i don't think i'm mistaken... right?
but you said, "sleep is the rehearsal of death," so why does life sleep? because we are not ready to welcome death.
it seemed like some urgent official business.
so... what does wildfire do all day?
get going to where, mister yang?
my "own" way... ha, i don't even remember what kind of life i want.
for now, we must deal with the new threat. my astrolabe tells me that a new meteorite has landed, and it's the biggest one yet.
hmm... weird mask, strange vibes, a little out of touch...
(i don't see any major plot holes.)
it was simply a new experience for me. one that is worth reliving.
well, what are you waiting for, little one?
you silvermane guards sure are a righteous bunch...
don't be mistaken, i won't put you in a difficult position. and i will fully respect your judgment.
that said, i hear that yae publishing house's novels are all reviewed by miko herself.
that person up ahead... is he asleep?
we're finally here. the entrance should be nearby...
the family is throwing a banquet there, and they sent invitations out to the express. i was curious about the state of the planet, so i accepted.
we could do with some more fortune...
state your query. to the point.
he came about as a byproduct of creating the shogun. perhaps it's because i feel like i owe him something, but i do not wish to assert control over him.
as a fellow arbiter-general, i fully understand the difficulties of this position.
we've made it up till now... i could lose an arm and a leg for all i care -- i have to lay eyes on the stellaron.
phew... finally. there won't be too many hindrances after this.
we'll go over there and see what we can find out. don't worry, i don't think she's gone too far.
brother and sister landau...? i know the brother must refer to gepard, but who could the sister be...
does that mean he wants to fight us during the charmony festival?
hats off to you, xiangling, serving the grilled fish with a dipping sauce is quite an innovative approach, the flavor is just to die for!
you don't know? but surely you should have more insight than anyone else into how your brother came to be this way?
it appears so. we can't go on like this.
the people of belobog hold both of you in high regard. they'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
i mean, these mirages were not steps towards solving the mystery, but rather a direct effect of whatever is going on.
in that case... your calling is to render those in misery blind and deaf? utter absurdity!
oh... that's true... master jean is always lending a hand to citizens in need... so strong, but so gentle, too...
...but to inspire them to save themselves.
besides, they're just kids. they should be allowed to believe it if it makes them happy. that's more important to them than questioning what's real and what isn't.
the memories are normally dispersed, and don't pose a threat. but when their energy is concentrated, it is likely to disturb the monsters.
delivery services these days make everything so much easier... i used to have to send my consultant running to and fro for this kind of thing.
wow, i'm really impressed. honestly, i envy you!
i should have gotten involved earlier, but i was tied up with other responsibilities. my apologies for letting you take on the investigation without proper support.
that mister reca said i'm better suited for dreamweaver academy instead of charmony academy.
right... the knights of favonius selection exam... *sigh*
sorry, ms. katheryne. actually, i am the one who wishes to take the exam...
i'm gonna stop you right there. refined wardrobe, elegant bearing... he may be a villain, but he doesn't look like someone who'd give up on finding a bathroom, even in an emergency...
yeah, you didn't think the future of belobog was at stake, right?
we heard about miss firefly from black swan... but we never expected miss robin to...
soooo what made you suddenly decide to come down from the express?
because... this is your home.
mister sunday has done some serious research on his suspects... this traitor must have been causing trouble for the family for a long time.
i think so too. the composition needs a little jazzing up.
get hold of the stellaron before cocolia realizes what's happening!
you intend to travel all over teyvat, and the time has come for the inazuma leg of your trip to come to an end, has it not?
back to the matter at hand. you have now witnessed the pain of those deprived of their visions... what are your feelings on what you have seen?
waving around such a giant weapon... master yunli favors using overwhelming force over strategy.
but sadly i'm afraid that... my strength is the only thing i truly am confident in...
why is our opponent... soulglad?
and the best way to do that is to make a great show of destroying the bogeyman they believe in before their very eyes.
they periodically throw out a lot of unclaimed or abandoned goods. we might find something that we can exchange for mora.
mmm, make sure to enjoy yourself before leaving this island.
oh, looks like little paimon's brain has gained a wrinkle or two! you guessed it so effortlessly! ...but you still guessed it wrong.
yikes, sweet talk alert... but it's true, thank you, mister giovanni!
however, she shared some strategies that other planets have taken -- some of them are very similar to our circumstances. i'm considering discussing with captain gepard the possibilities of adopting those strategies...
i helped set the underlying mechanisms for this type of gear bridge. it's controlled via different terminals in combination. let's go find them.
...no, i figured i could just learn it by drinking flaming potent tea.
relax! i'll help you look for them, you have my word. tsk, my exquisite sense of humor always goes unappreciated.
phew... i never knew how long it took to get from the administrative district to the snow plains.
help him make the preparations first. the incense exorcism, the one i taught you.
little misha and old mikhail's homeland... having been through so much in penacony, as an aspiring nameless, i believe a visit to his home world is a must.
there's also a "dream's eye" left here by a dreamweaver... we're running out of time, we'll have to use it if necessary.
...hah? hold up, he's back? that can't be, he was still in the city a little while ago...
the deadline is looming... i'm counting on you.
dreamscapes glowin', gold halls flowin', a legendary feast's about to get goin'.
mm-hmm... that's right, we won't be making any mistakes this time round!
just what crime did you commit exactly? they recalled a bunch of guards from the front line to track you down -- it's unprecedented. now they're patrolling the whole city and everyone's in a panic.
if you let us in we can do a routine service inspection... i've worked on various iterations of this type of installation...
you're not the first person to say that. in fact, some people think i'll literally do any favor they ask me to.
if the sound of music can flow like the rivers and streams into every corner of the land, perhaps the souls of those who have gone before us will hear the song of a new era. i wonder whether the melodies will be to their liking...
what's that? would you like to order something, guoba? please, by all means, it's my treat! i'll just open a tab under "xiangling"!
look how far we've come! don't chicken out on us now.
stellarons are clouded in mystery -- even herta isn't able to fully understand them... but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
*cough* it was built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa rand, and also...
i don't know if she can give us any leads, but it's always good to say hi to a friend -- basic courtesy, right?
this is the ninja mantra. embellishing words with ninja enchantments is bound to make the play a hundred times more vivid.
ugh -- can't find a way to break their formation!
no, the legion's weapon shouldn't go down so easily.
over the years, the destruction's minions have wreaked havoc on countless worlds, and the alliance has been keeping an eye on them. but no one expected them to join hands with the remnants of the abundance.
despite all the hardships elder huaiyan has faced, he still finds joy in the world. he is an example every general should follow.
but not everyone has the capability to make rational decisions.
dan heng, do you know something that we don't? why did the front desk mention that pom-pom is staying at the hotel too?
we have an easy enough time of it. at the worst, we'd have to apologize, smile, and pay a fine. it wouldn't be the end of the world.
welcome to horizon of existence...
but what if they... and we... aren't really that special?
do not underestimate the enemy. hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. the advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
anyway. more importantly right now, the fireworks show is right around the corner and the materials still haven't arrived. we need to think of an alternative...
no way! not even close!
i believe it too. your wish will surely come true.
i am astrologist mona megistus. but considering that it is most rude to misremember names, i allow others to call me mona.
that means i can make more room in my suitcase. what else should i bring...
i just peeked into my scryglass, and there's a new mirage forming on the island over there.
i--it's not that i don't trust you... it's just...
he cut you off completely! this guy...
we have a rule that forbids us from teaching outsiders, but i suppose... i suppose i could teach you.
so many people talking about it, this commotion at the theme park definitely made waves...
yup! i always say what i'm thinking.
i've looked at some of the climate reports, and based on the data i've seen, it'll take three or four more generations for the snow to completely subside.
it feels like the people here are all under the supervision of robots...
this guitar was one of those inventions. cocolia came up with a name...
now that was intense! i can't remember the last time i had so much fun.
see you next time. i'll look forward to hearing good news from you soon.
yes, they are. they are strong and resilient, and have much to be proud of.
what do you mean? are you not coming with us...?
hehe... thanks for sticking with me through everything.
well... fireworks are my craft after all. every batch has to be spectacular! hee-hee...
you did quite admirably. i could see your determination and your hard work.
a memetic life that can only be seen by a select few... it's just like a hidden message... left by someone for the nameless.
i could tell he was giving himself a lot of pressure, so i gave him a suggestion~
okay! i'll await your word.
she's probably still in the great mine helping the miners. come on, let's get going!
hey, seeing as there's nothing on your plate just now, wanna help me fix up this machine? just a bit of manual labor -- you might find it interesting.
ninja hiryu is right. since i have already relinquished the super ninja scroll, i'll rely on my fists to awaken these ninja initiates that succumbed to the way of the fiendling.
time flies when you're having fun... it seems to flow away from you like a rushing river... as precious and short-lived as a cherry blossom dancing in the wind...
"ultimately auspicious..." wow, sounds pretty good to me -- seems like we really were destined to meet today, then.
...give it a little push... and then kaboom! they'll never see it coming!
no... it's all because of your encouragement... otherwise, i...
i love the cute outfit, with the hat, and that cool little symbol, so unique. and your backpack -- wow, it's really well-made.
oh, i... i couldn't even handle this smallest of tasks...
i... i don't remember... it's a blank canvas...
forget it, i don't kick people when they're down, even if they annoy me.
goodness. are people in liyue really so complex these days?
hahaha, ah, your interactions are so adorable to watch... ahem! i mean, um... i can certainly find someone to tailor a paimon-sized outfit, if paimon so wishes.
(but i just don't understand. how did she do it? and what does "pawn" really mean? i should go back and ask...)
yes. the true raiden shogun, who meditates endlessly in the plane of euthymia to preserve her being...
so you'll stay and keep her company, yes? don't worry, you'll both receive ample compensation for your trouble.
i admit, seele is talented. we... do work well together. but that's all there is to it.
just like a clock's hands that turn round and round, the start and end of each day will always land on twelve o'clock -- the advent of time moving forward.
if you get hit by the musou no hitotachi, that's it. it's game over. i would get training if i were you.
yes, that sums it up very well. most people looking to buy my time are businesspeople who believe that whatever they spend now, they will make back several times over in due course.
*sigh* i calmed down and thought about it a bit. if it turns out that woman isn't lying, then a lot of innocent people are gonna get hurt... now's the time for thinking about other people... hehe *sigh*
let's go speak with the researchers. right now, the space station can't afford any more unexpected turns, especially from within. have you tried contacting herta?
not like that! you won't be "seeing him later." let's stick to "good bye" and such.
i hope the ipc made an effort to create some easy-to-follow routes for the players this time...
ugh, can you and the fern get a room already? how can anyone establish a bond with a houseplant? ...although i guess you could say the same about me and my teddy bears...
the question is, do you know who we are?
mm, hello everybody, i'm himeko, a nameless from the astral express, and these are my companions.
do not be troubled over me, master. mere physical suffering can never devastate my ninja spirit.
hmm... i'm starting to have second thoughts...
and this place is amazing! it's way bigger than ritou's port! there are also a lot more stores here.
in any case, now that we have the meteor fragment, the museum can now open to the public. that's good news.
remember this! my name is march seventh! ringmaster of the luofu!
how fascinating... you must be full of secrets. there's an intriguing story to be told here, no doubt.
really? i--i'd love to, but you'd have to promise you won't laugh at me.
sakujirou and keisuke are up ahead, right? we need to talk to them about something.
but everything's not so ordinary anymore, is it?
and you're here now, so even if you're gonna leave eventually, i wanna make sure you at least leave with fond memories.
persikov may be a mad scientist, but he didn't want to see his subordinates suffer. besides, if he didn't solve the problem, he would end up going insane as well.
that's for you to make a considered judgment on.
our first priority is finding the thief and recovering the stolen item, but we don't even have a suspect yet... that's why this case is such a conundrum for the silvermane guards.
but something big happened there recently, right? didn't their archon leave all of a sudden?
"outlander brigade: when the wind of death blew towards the blond samurai"...? what a long name... must be a new one, i've never heard of it.
i see. it's no wonder you said i can't provide anything of equal value, because nothing i own holds any meaning...
was that supposed to be symbolic...? like, if the dog didn't exist, maybe the injured animals didn't, either...
what are you so afraid of, honestly? we're finally about to meet the true author of "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits." aren't you excited?
a whole generation has grown up in the underworld in the last decade or so, and they never had the privilege of seeing these precious works of art and historical treasures... what you've done has helped bridge a huge gap for them.
then i'll wait for you over there. there's still some good news that i'd like share with chevreuse.
i guess complaining won't get us anywhere. let's go lend them a hand.
here we go! we'll have another mastery mark in no time!
people will never achieve true happiness in a world like that! they would just be toys for the aeon!
no no, after all they've brought everyone this sleepy dreamscape which everyone loves. i just feel like i'm starting to understand them less and less...
so. where will you go now, tulipe?
that's why i'm here, but i wouldn't call that my wish. i don't think that alone will call the stars down for us, right?
how can we bring a giant like this down?
this area is full of mountains and rivers. it's normal to not know the fastest route.
when i was little, i thought it was because he really understood me, and agreed with whatever i had to say. so, i'd tell my pops everything.
did you pick up on something, ninja hiryu?
penacony. do you remember? before kafka's proposal, that was our original destination.
this memory should be from the first day we arrived in belobog. by the second day, we were wanted criminals already...
"the person present, who shouldn't be"... who could it be?
(they wouldn't have met up at the dock, it's too open. no good for discussing evil plans...)
but of course! far be it from me to suggest that the true breadth of her highness' culinary brilliance can be displayed in a single dish...
a loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. she is worthy to be called a hero. with an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the kujou clan is assured.
i command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. rest well tonight.
if your decision is firm, don't hesitate to roar with conviction!
my, someone rather discerning fitted out this shrine.
really? i've never been able to do it successfully myself!
when we arrived just now, the hosts at xinyue kiosk told me our dishes are almost ready. perfect timing.
you're putting canned sardines into a hotpot!? please don't say that...
what you said was the last piece of the puzzle for me. i suddenly realized that my decision to leave was just me trying to run away from my problems... wasn't a mature decision.
...ah, i remember now. the minister of transportation, noel, has a nephew named norbert -- i believe he's currently working in the municipal department as a transportation coordinator.
there's still some time before the next part of the script unfolds. let me stay a little longer in this body.
but it's so powerful that i haven't found anywhere i can test it out yet... may as well give it to you. let me know how it turns out.
of course, the family did not agree. the result of the failed negotiations... is as you see it now.
haha, i see you're already a full-fledged trailblazer. you're right, we can't remain indifferent to those in crisis.
no problem, but remember that a debate is like a duel. the more you hesitate, the farther you are from victory.
aiya, there's no need for self-deprecation. i've seen people from all walks of life, and i can tell just from the way your sleeves flutter in the wind that you're a man of culture.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. may we access the hotel's dreampool entry records?
wow, look at all the lanterns here! it's so beautiful!
he managed to extricate himself from the dream on his own strength? how is that possible?
he's actually going over to the other side... fischl, haven't you taught your raven anything about loyalty?
then, my way of the ninja shall be...
ugh, i declare this dish dead, rest in peace.
they sought out architects who refused to leave -- those who insisted on defending their homes. the ipc provided these architects with significant funds to aid them against the coming disaster.
thank you for accepting our answer to your riddle yesterday.
alright, it's like this. all we need to do is load the robot onto the mine cart...
good. how about you, little one? i trust you don't have any reason to refuse?
why does life slumber...? we don't know the answer yet, but we're about to awaken from this dream.
hehe. come now ayato, we're not strangers here. there's no need to sound so formal.
hmm... i still have those things i bought on sale. if i want to maximize my use of space, i'll need to plan this out more carefully.
this way! why do you seem so out of it? haven't you woken up yet?
sure, ask away. we've got plenty of time.
oh yeah, i guess. you're pretty smart... sometimes.
perhaps that is the reason why you were able to return precisely to this point in time without any problems.
anyway. there's a writers' submission event going on at the moment. start by talking to readers and finding out what they're into. when you have an idea of what the current trends are, come back and see me.
i've noticed an issue. although we've fixed the machine, as you can see -- the mirages on the islands have still not disappeared.
fists, palms, and fingers... *gasp* rock, paper, scissors! phew! no wonder i was confused!
really? so she's still on the xianzhou.
oh, i don't know... perhaps it could be something to do with a lost item from the original jade chamber collection that has quietly made its way into your hands?
...what the actual heck is she saying?
it can get uncomfortable, i guess... but what else would i be using my voice for?
we'll conclude today's navigation meeting on this point. there's a bit of time left before we jump. in the meantime, might be a good idea to double-check your bags.
alright. goodbye then, urakusai.
it's a hairpin in the style of a white heron. as well as a hair accessory, you can also use it as an ornament.
aww, there's nothing to be afraid of! he just looks a little scary, but dan heng says he's more bark than bite.
oh! that's right, i almost forgot...
most of it was destroyed in the process, and the small handful of items that survived intact are strewn across the water's surface. reclaiming them is taxing work.
however, following this duel, i have decided to postpone the kujou clan's punishment for the time being.
but a word of warning, i am very picky about my grilled fish... i can be a tough lady to impress.
is there something wrong with clockie's statue? why did you suddenly jump just now?
no need to rush. if he truly has laid a trap... he will definitely use every means to lure us in.
with you by my side, though our mouths stay silent, my heart is at peace.
i had my secretary do some analysis. the current price of luminescent spines far exceeds the profits that could be made on the end product.
they are simply ordinary items. and there was no coercion or enticement during the auction -- every bid was voluntary.
i'm very sorry... in these circumstances, i must ask you to register the quantity and nature of your lost property with the knights of favonius.
that's okay. this one is not for profit.
traveler, i have a gift for you.
but we haven't heard anything about the watchmaker having descendants, and the name "mikhail" is not rare. perhaps it's merely a coincidence.
doctor edward from the dreamscape sales store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
...and then even slower than that, until the lines between your body and the entire world become blurry. you won't be able to tell reality from dreams because they have all been shattered.
we're standing on the ceiling right now.
and that's the only cocolia you guys ever got to know, huh... always ahead of everyone else, never looking back, even for a second...
great. this is going well.
but our mission at yae publishing house is to brings dreams and happiness to the masses. it would be a crying shame if we couldn't even help one adorable little girl fulfill her wish.
the stars that make up a constellation -- the stella fortuna -- are genuine celestial bodies in the depths of space. they are not simply notional.
sorry, i'm not quite following you... what curse? and what killer?
no, no. no need to seriously consider it. it's just a little fantasy of mine.
if there's anything weighing on your mind, you can always talk to me. i'm always happy to listen to other people's problems... who knows, i might even try to help you come up with a solution.
ah, i could've kept watching that forever. that was the realest, grandest, most magical dream i've ever had!
how can words suffice? hmm... in this world, seeing is believing.
this is the grand narukami shrine, after all. ultimately, their actions here are tantamount to disrespecting the shogun herself...
but my friend, kitsune saiguu, reassured me that i had nothing to worry about. she would shoulder the responsibility of protecting inazuma, and mobilize all forces at her disposal to combat the threat.
(that's pu'er's little secret -- he transforms into an aurumaton in dire situations.)
but even though we're all well-acquainted by now, i think this festive gathering deserves something ceremonious.
the fallen aeon, deceased trailblaze -- their passing is still a mystery, but of all the known aeons, akivili was the closest to mankind.
any junior fortune-teller could have told you this, but... that man was a fatui harbinger! that was too close, how did you manage to get caught up with a guy like him?
huh? you start work this early?
more importantly, let's see how dan heng's doing! hee-hee, ask him what he's up to -- then tell him we're having loads of fun!
if things play out as i expect, dragon fiendling will let slip her true nature in this class.
or in layman's terms... basically, the creator made this world inside a mirror, or a lake, and this world is the reflection.
take your time. enjoy the meal and calm yourself.
the skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than i imagined now that i'm on board.
come on, you don't have to actually become my disciple. you just need to act the part.
it's already so late, and i'm no further along on finishing tomorrow's astrology column. what? you're off to sleep? *sigh* i wish i could sleep now too...
wait, hold on! wh--what would you say to a group discount!? thirty percent off for parties of ten!
what's this... xianzhou clothing? it's so beautiful!
come to me anytime if you have more questions.
if you walk with your head down and your heart full of fear, your steps will grow heavier and your spirit will suffer.
mumbling?! i'm praying!
a plot? ...so he was scheming the whole time?
so! fill me in, how have you all been doing?
now that we have awoken from our dream, we must learn to say farewell.
such a huge port and not a soul in sight. it gives me the creeps...
how's it going, my little layla? have you been teaching your opponents a lesson?
oh, by the way, if you still want to help run the history and culture museum, miss eris and i are always happy to work with you.
they will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. we can only give them our best wishes from afar.
so, eric, why did they threaten you like that. what happened?
flat, dry, sheltered, facing the sun, high elevation...
just listen to your gut -- you were the one who said that... the remembrance doesn't lie.
garden of recollection... is it the group that serves the aeon of remembrance?
as a maid, and in order to be worthy of this armor, i'm currently undergoing the knights of favonius chivalric training.
why was this tv... dumped on the side of the road?
the verdant knights followed the route you mentioned and discovered the wreckage of the whistling flames ship. unfortunately, there were no survivors, and no cargo.
younger people have bundles of energy, and older people have a wealth of wisdom. each have their strengths.
"trailblaze" is our mission and the source of strength that powers the express to travel across the galaxy.
how are you doing, mister morris? you having a good time?
my brother said the restricted zone energy lines were malfunctioning -- told me it was urgent. he doesn't trust those contracted maintenance workers... so he got me in for free.
in the past, i used to have many believers coming to see me at the shrine every day, and most of them came for the same reason.
come on. let's go get this weasel thief.
we're going to look for firework materials shortly. while we're out, we'll sort out the boat situation for you, as promised.
excellent, then let's collect the kimono. then we can pay a visit to my mother's mysterious and transcendent friend...
oh, did you think i was over-promising back there? don't worry, i have experience with this kind of thing.
and, you probably noticed it when you woke up as well -- the ticking of clocks all around us... my gut tells me that the secret hidden here is also linked to that mysterious watchmaker.
well, either we reason with them or charge straight through the blockade... let's play it by ear!
my thinking was that only people who pre-order the chess set at full price will be eligible to receive the limited-edition traveler chess piece.
you'd better be careful. don't get too close to blitzara when you're knee-deep in the water, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a very unique lower-leg massage.
like i said, don't ever doubt my professional instincts. now, all we have to do is escort this lost child back to wuwang hill, and we should be done and dust-to-dusted!
well, that's not up to me... dig in. i called you here so you could enjoy the food.
it's all thanks to her that inazuma lived to see this day.
that jingliu seems pretty dangerous... *sigh* the stellaron crisis sure has attracted a lot of strange people to the luofu.
...i don't think we can get around them. knocking them out is the only way to go...
that's okay. my intention here was to show you some of the repercussions of that great battle.
but if in that moment, i chose to draw my blade...
oh, and ogura mio has just received a new batch of silk. she might've come up with some new kimono designs.
oh, that happens to me all the time. it feels like i had a dream, but i can't remember anything about it.
so, liyue lives up to its reputation... its culture has a long history and gives rise to the most beautiful legends. quite captivating.
ahem! anyway! time is of the essence, i have a lot of bulk-buying to do!
do you say this because you have not yet reconciled yourself with your defeat?
based on what i have seen today, i am forced to accept that inazuma is a completely different place from the one i remember.
oh, yes! that's the one. i remember when he drank it -- hee-hee, i've never seen him enjoy a bottle of wine so much in his life! he was telling me all night about how good it tasted.
as victories go... i think i earned this one, didn't i?
the plague took the lives of many, which only furthered its spread, as the dead were a breeding ground for the disease.
then... mister cyrus, may i give it a try?
what are you talking about? are you still half-asleep or something...? the order's dream is over.
let's go, i think this conversation's run its course...
oh... sorry, i couldn't help myself...
still, you did end up victorious. i gather congratulations are in order.
for as long as i can remember, my days have been an endless cycle of studying, etiquette lessons, and training.
*sigh* you've seen a lot of my ignorant side today. maybe you can't tell, but all this has challenged my understanding of things.
this victory has nothing to do with swordplay, and everything to do with the power of technology.
it's not the answer that's important, but what we can learn from others' answers... right?
i mean, when yunli swung that massive sword, she just casually blocked her attack with ease...
ah... in that case, i must apologize for my rudeness. do you remember when we first met? i once said you reminded me of an acquaintance.
(don't forget -- he's modeled after you, mister yang.)
but it's fine if you want to give it a shot... i trust your judgment.
pray tell... have i proven myself worthy of the title of "ninja hero"?
uh, that won't be necessary -- we've already made a high-quality replica.
and i suppose the family happened to possess the knowledge to seal the stellaron?
the family itself is a huge, perfect building. like... a living idol.
of course not. after all, you were caught up in all this already, just like meng. it's not the end of the world if you catch a glimpse behind the curtain.
hmph. you are quite mistaken if you think your dispute is of any interest to me. descendant of the takatsukasa clan, you wish to become the new tenryou commissioner. do i understand this correctly?
a classic tale of youth and friendship. it never gets old.
i get it. well, if that's how it is, then that's how it is. eh-he, y'know, i was going to ask you guys if you wanted to stay here in inazuma.
is it too late for regrets? i'm already regretting my impulsive decision.
zhongli sure loves his lofty turns of phrase. but if you ask me, it's all thanks to that man who stopped to ask for directions.
ugh, can you believe that guy? he calls us suckers, and then he just trots off!
i hope you really give this a good shot, you and haniyyah. the future of this highly entertaining tournament depends on the decisions you make from now on... i'm excited to see what you've got in store for us.
go on. open it up, show me what's inside.
i think they call that "complaining from the heart."
even if there really is only a slight possibility that everything you say is true...
hmm. so you've heard of it, too.
and... i have a feeling that this one is my mirage.
hmm, i just hope that doesn't affect your performance today!
in short, whatever ingredients you use, it's essential to include something sweet.
you've been all over, so you must've seen a lot. when you've got the time, tell me your story, yea?
that was my final question, thank you. we all have our paths to walk, so we shall bid our farewells.
oh no... those tenryou commission brutes are torturing him.
don't worry, you'll get used to it too, and before you know it you'll be a mature and dependable passenger just like me.
...but that is what we're here for! that mastery mark is ours!
i was talking to mister yang about my career as a mechanic and my time in the silvermane guards. somehow, we got onto that so-called engine of creation...
this place always seems so clean and tidy.
because you can't guarantee that telling an ignorant person the truth will improve the situation instead of exacerbating it.
...whoa, the words on the note are changing!
what an honor! where are my manners -- we can talk about heaters all day if you like. let's have a chat~
as soon as the legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip... how does that saying go again? "greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword..."
hold on! let me take a wild guess. hmm, yes... oh, you must be here for the lantern rite!
so the one in this photo... are you sure it isn't me?
i knew i'd offended that diviner -- that's why she sent this girl to help us!
but didn't someone work hard to make this? i can't just take it from here...
you can trust me. i know our paths have only crossed once before, but my intuition tells me you guys are good people. and i've got good intuition by the way, haha.
i've been familiarizing myself with the angler mystery lately. -- i think it's safe to say i have the best investigative mind on the express at this point...
i suppose what it comes down to is the definition of "eternity" she set out with.
because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
no matter how long it takes, i am committed to bringing this to fruition. this is my promise.
what's happening? my mouth was running on autopilot. this class definitely seems fishy.
a trip? to liyue!? oh, i couldn't possibly justify that. in the time it would take to get to liyue and back, i could have finished several of my books!
the best option was for her to directly interact with humans. there's no need to feel sad, i believe she was content when she left us.
please let me know if you ever need my assistance. i hope i can be of some help to you too.
pity, he's gonna miss out! we never get the chance to go on a stress-free adventure.
these facilities will make it much easier to maintain our weapons.
seriously... i just spent so much time thinking about my dream, but he didn't even ask me!
once the number of ceremonial affairs conducted in the city began to decline, our forebears built a teahouse here. only members of the yashiro commission are permitted to come and go as they please.
if it helps you to trust me, i'm willing to answer your questions to the best of my ability.
greetings, i am the dazzling ninja, aka rappa.
there's no need to keep either of you in the dark. to tell the truth, i've too much weighing on my mind right now to even think about the solwarm festival.
and you will die. i mean... all of you will.
oh, that reminds me. a new year of work is about to begin.
huh? can't we just bring some desserts? like the fontinalia mousse?
because he was born with a desire to "trailblaze," wasn't he?
i've seen your face before, stellaron hunter, even if it was only on a corporation wanted poster. they were offering quite the bounty... dead or alive. do you know the figure?
you won't fit in the suitcase! can't you walk?
should the one within wish to stray from the rules, this body shall stand in her way.
so is there really a ghost around here?
last time you entered the plane of euthymia, it was in front of the statue of the omnipresent god, correct?
but you're quite right: trivial matters aside, there's no escaping the fact that we have a grand concert to organize.
...wait, what do you mean, "either"?
let me introduce you to robin. she woke up from ena's dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
if i were to use baron bunny to lure the enemy away and protect my fellow knights... i suppose i could do it?
...fischl, that's enough!
your hometown once experienced a similar catastrophe to jarilo-vi, so i can understand your perspective on the issue and the position you have taken.
oh and also, "self defense: the art of down-to-earth dialogue with monsters"... the combat approach of adventurers is definitely worth further study.
entropy loss syndrome. have you heard of this term?
really!? then where is the real satelleden? will i have the chance to go see it with the express?
the descendants of the isshin art are none other than the kaedehara family.
how did the conversation get so heavy again!? no good -- let's talk about something interesting.
...why don't i just get this one called "kumquat curls"! curly orange hair, it's perfect for taking pictures and shopping!
but since the three commissions work together to serve the shogun, they have a close relationship. someone from one of the other commissions might have an easier job of figuring out what they're up to...
i hope you realize how lucky you are. if it was anyone else, i don't think i'd have the patience to keep greeting them with a smile after the first few times.
take your time, no rush. i'm here to help.
she's trying to say, thanks, you say all the right things! um, and the same goes for me too. pleasure to meet you. i'm mona, an astrologist.
now, i'll press the advantage.
clara, you're observant, right? take a look at us. do we look like underworlders?
...uhh, is touching a heater a good idea? this thing is red-hot -- what if my hand turns extra crispy...
ugh... my scryglass is getting clearer, but i still can't see much...
over here, clara! wanna learn some cool poses?
then you must have also been a leader at some point.
of course, it would have been more stressful for shingo and youhei that way, hehe. still, the experience may ultimately have been more effective than me scaring them into submission with a little exaggeration.
hah! if by that you mean "thank you, miko," then you're welcome. haniyyah needed a little pep talk to perk her up so that she would join us in taking a stand against elchingen. how else was i supposed to motivate her?
it's precisely what makes auctions so interesting, don't you think?
alright, let's get moving. we should follow herta's instructions.
that's why he'll give it his all in the upcoming battle.
regarding the recent mishap... i understand it negatively impacted some of our guests. as a member of the family, it's only right for me to come forward and offer my apologies to everyone.
so that's why you were so silent! hmph, if you wanna be as awesome as us, you better start training every day~
calm down. the war you speak of is over.
do you remember that recent incident when the rifthounds were gnawing at the sacred sakura's roots?
...forget about it. just let me keep an eye on him! if that doesn't work, we can just turn the tables and use him instead!
mm, clearly very closely based on your own personal experience, with no major changes at all.
while this decision isn't finalized yet, we are honored that everyone here recognizes the way of the trailblaze.
that's right. we're investigating a murder for the family. can we speak to your captain about the case?
the protagonist is a transfer student, new to the school, whose ordinary life is about to take a wild turn when they meet the ballad-and-alcohol-loving principal. sounds interesting. approved!
this is precisely why when entering the plane of euthymia, it's much safer if you place your consciousness in a physical object first.
i think these unusual structures are some kind of mirage. according to what kazuha said, all this seems to be constructed based on kazuha's memory.
the path of harmony in penacony must not be distorted again... and such a tragedy must never recur.
i can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.
progress was really slow, but they managed to hunt down some new clues.
i'm glad that you found a new life here in penacony, it's just...
there's no reason to be upset by this. time flies by in an instant, and life passes by like a dream. so, you must be happy in the present. you should understand what i mean now.
then why did you still come here...
hehe, oh, don't you worry about that. you can most definitely afford it... they're still printing your light novel by the batch, you know. you have quite the generous payment due.
what do you think? any idea what the correct order is?
anyway, beidou is currently in the guyun stone forest area.
the tea house has no more rooms? then come, sit in the jade chamber... if you can afford the price.
without you, it would've been impossible for me to win on my own. it's just as i expected, my swordsmanship is still far from your level.
i never knew there was such a fuss over these tiny figurines... i'm surprised miko never mentioned it to me.
sure you don't want my help? c'mon, it's a great deal: cook twice the amount in the same time!
i wonder how their relationship is now.
phew... hopefully it won't be coming back any time soon.
perfect! okay, we need to get to the front line.
is gepard on front line duty a lot?
if we travel north, we'll reach the wangshu inn. i hear that the food there is really good, so let's go try it out!
his thinking is very spontaneous... is this typical of artists?
you might not believe it, but before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
hmm... the next time i entertain guests from liyue... i wonder if i'll be able to prepare such delicious food for them...
the harmony accepts everyone, including wanderers from afar. the family takes them in, but they... don't belong here.
(sneaking in was easier than i thought. the family's security is as lax as ever.)
are there other volumes of "hymn of the holy land"? where can i find them?
in the end, i simply had to accept that it was a miraculous effect of makoto's consciousness.
huh... him again? i wonder why mister giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
huh, you must've had some miserable jobs.
...as the successor to the guardian of belobog, i must always be vigilant of my behavior and thoughts.
never mind, at least it's memorable... a little farewell gift from the astral express.
oh? and how is my favorite little one doing, hmm?
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "the way of the ninja is long and windy, and trials and tribulations are mere amusements..."
astrology reveals the truth unreservedly. but, not everyone is willing to accept their fate.
i've heard that even the unofficial genius invokation tournament is enjoying a huge turnout. many serious tcg players have registered for both the official and unofficial ones.
even if no one stopped us, the idea of the yashiro commission going out into the crowd... it'd certainly draw some strange looks. people would probably start thinking there was trouble afoot.
now i've got one of my items back, let me show you what makes it so special.
no problem. just think of it as my greeting gift for little klee.
but... if you ever really do become an evil spirit and come back with more nefarious nonsense in mind, i may have to forget our friendship and give you a far less fond farewell...
to her, reuniting with her aranara friend is the "result." but recapturing her past joy and belief in herself is the "process," and that's where our help is needed.
no need to thank me, i'm just doing as a good master should!
i'm feixiao, general of the xianzhou yaoqing. now that we're acquainted, should the astral express run into any trouble, feel free to contact me. the yaoqing will be there in an instant.
huh? really? how did you know!?
they are similar, but not identical.
i have some words to share with you, though they were spoken to me by miss acheron. she said that "the so-called impossible is merely something that has yet to happen..."
i was going to say that... but now i suddenly don't want to.
is this miss acheron? hello, i'm himeko, the astral express' navigator.
this is svarog's lair? i thought it'd be cold and lifeless, turns out it's pretty busy!
mondstadt's fresh fruit juice is hard to top. i wish i could enjoy some every day.
every year, one of the five would present a collection of the group's poems to the shogun for review, which would then spark cultured discussions regarding those works.
you guys... you're not cloud knights acting as borisin, are you?
the general's smiling again -- definitely errands...
first, the disciples of sanctus medicus grew uninterrupted on the luofu, yet the six charioteers were not aware of it. that was a dereliction of duty.
i bet it's about how to deal with the generals from the yaoqing and the zhuming.
the outcome of our mobilization speaks for itself. the children of belobog have made their decision. they have chosen to preserve this homeland with their own two hands.
yes, and you are the hero.
hmm, makes sense... guess we better head over to serval's workshop then?
this is it, the international trade association.
what are those people... i mean, those "monsters" we just dealt with?
however, due to an order that was given many years ago, nobody has moved between the overworld and the underworld in a long time.
it's not that i don't want to. it's just that i can't... i've come so far, and i can't sum up all of that in just a few words.
alright, let's get down to business! my glamorous assistant, please activate the device!
hehe, that's for sure. and you know what? the way i see it, the museum's reopening is a very significant event... and worth remembering more than any other time in the past.
i will continue investigating here and call you if i find anything interesting.
oh, her? her name is avin. i saw that she was looking quite forlorn, so i wanted to make sure she wasn't feeling left out or alone.
ah traveler, paimon, you made it. did you rest well yesterday?
ah, it looks like the entire delegation from the xianzhou yaoqing has gathered at the alchemy commission. why don't we go see general feixiao and bring her some fruit?
okay, um, let me give you the full story.
(avin almost caught up to me. she sure is something.)
when your stars are on track, it means you will be healthy, happy, and at peace.
hehe, don't get too down just yet, though -- i mentioned that sakujirou ordered a firework from me, didn't i?
it seems only fitting for someone of your status.
now that you mention it, i'm getting a little peckish myself...
but i promise that i'll do a reading for you first thing once i'm ready!
my childhood memories run deep. i'll always have a special affection for fish.
an inquisition spirit...? on the express?
i invited you out for some simple fun and games... *sigh* i should have known you'd be like this.
oh? surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
i'd better buy them all before i learn how to "detach and declutter"!
before all this, i was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
alright then. feel free to take a look around the venue before it kicks off.
there are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward...?
not many from outside liyue earn the right to ascend to the jade chamber. but i have been in correspondence with the acting grand master of the knights of favonius, who spoke highly of you.
bronya moves fast! the crisis is only just over and she's already opened talks with the ipc.
not only that, urakusai, but my latest work has beaten that book you wrote, "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits," to become the most popular in inazuma.
you can return to a safe location after touching this object. "pinecany" truly is filled with boundless mysteries.
i even asked the spark knight to pass on her experiences, although... master jean grounded us shortly after...
look, that's the penacony grand theater over there.
since you're here... i'll just keep it short. just over half an hour ago, i received a message from an unknown sender, and rushed here as soon as i could.
now for step three: yank out that anxiety and cast it away with all your might!
come now, did you really think we wouldn't notice you sneaking around?
you seemed to be getting quite into it. what a shame that you didn't manage to go home with anything.
how can you make such a simple dish taste so good? my admiration towards you just keeps growing!
currently, the shogun is unable to handle any business and cannot appear as me. so the easiest solution was to announce that i am resting.
ninja six-phased ice! such formidable ice mastery! ninja ruri truly proves her might!
such an important event should be entrusted to the most qualified candidate. keqing is disciplined, yet passionate about her work, so she's naturally the best fit for the job.
i feel like i'm gonna be sick...
...what was seele's perspective on the matter?
is it true that hilichurls grow stronger from eating sunsettias? surely it should be some sort of meat, at least?
sorry, but human lives and the family's reputation are at stake. it is imperative we know everything about the case.
hehehe, maybe you should leave me to do the explaining.
because i'm currently in a car with a sleep-deprived driver... i just want to get there in one piece.
eh, what's that? it looks like there's something on clockie's face.
relax, i'm just joking. baishi probably made arrangements yesterday to add a few extra dishes to the breakfast menu.
well, as luck would have it, i happen to be in a good mood today. how about i tell you a story from long ago, hmm?
trust me, they're going to work wonders. this marketing strategy has been used by wangsheng funeral parlor for generations.
that's right! at the dinner table that night, i just knew this young bard was a rare talent with exceptional taste. you know, it's rare to encounter such a kindred spirit.
if i don't do this, the shogun's rules can never change, and inazuma can never move forward.
not a chance. even if their heir was someone who showed promise, their past mistakes cannot be erased.
never mind. i'll explain in detail later -- she's here.
and yet, you stand here right now, which also means... that man failed.
all thanks to the support of our loyal customers. the family business just keeps getting better and better.
*sigh* we'll just have to head straight and keep looking.
huh? hold up, i wasn't that late...
come on, take this. it'll help with your injuries.
oh, you're right... wow, the time flew by so quickly...
...there's... something wrong with you.
it was all just a bunch of palatable lies. i hope you never have a similar experience, march.
astrology is an ancient and mysterious art. if your problem is a banal one, you can count me out, as i have better things to do.
two gifts? has his conscience finally gotten the better of him? is he going to make up for all our hard work along the way?
when you were kids, surely you guys believed in things like heroes who slayed dragons, and sacred swords that cut through darkness? it's the same thing.
i have rather simple tastes. precise, pure, smart, and sophisticated. that is all i require.
himeko must be gathering information. let's hurry up and get going.
when the time comes, be sure to visit and participate in all the events.
this sealed envelope must be an official report that the tenryou commission is preparing to present to the shogun.
ei, how are you feeling now?
there's an ad in the knife case: "spices supreme," aurum alley? which store is that again?
he sold his kids to chase a dream... even if he intended to go back for them, it's still insanely irresponsible.
no worries, say no more -- we'll handle it!
i kindly request an immediate warp jump out of the asdana star system.
now then, if you wouldn't mind accompanying me to the knights of favonius, the registration process only requires--
the answer lies with the three of you. i'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
so, i will be performing a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.
oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
set forth on your voyage without hesitation, nameless, on the path of the trailblaze.
does this place ring any bells, misha?
(what to do first... hmm, maybe i'll see what they're selling around here.)
whenever we passed by busy crowds, she kept turning her head and taking in all the things around her. at first, i thought she was afraid that someone might bump into us...
i'm concerned about the effects it may have in the long run.
there's nothing personal in it -- have a read if you like.
oh? did she look crestfallen and say something melodramatic like "beyond the reach of mere mortals"? then curl up on the ground and start wailing?
gallagher... gallagher... where could he be?
i've already thought it through, seele. i am madam cocolia's daughter. that will never change.
what's her deal...? we can't discuss the case with other people hanging around the bar.
come on, i need to look around a bit more before i can be sure...
so be it. the sensation is not a disagreeable one.
i did consider that possibility, and i won't lie -- it'd be a real bummer if that were the case.
and over the next few days, i'd also like to thank everyone for their support.
this doll that looks like a rabbit... can speak...
oh, right, she did give me some sort of card...
to be honest, you never really get used to them! we always used to rely on himeko and mister yang.
we've already come this far together. i'd like to join you for the rest of your journey on penacony. i'm pleased that we can finally fight shoulder-to-shoulder -- i couldn't ask for a better ending.
why do i wield my sword...? i wield my sword to take down my enemies! i mean what other reason is there?
the madam guardian has her reasons...
hehehe... "those with keen eyes see the dust between the stars!" i came up with that, by the way.
hmm... it's a bit greasy for my taste.
that when that moment arrives for us to make a choice, the answer to our end will already be within our hearts
while albedo was checking just now, i gave my scryglass a spin, hoping to find some information...
if anything were to happen to it, i wouldn't be able to report back to that old crone...
no worries! you put on quite the convincing performance!
the advantage of that is that if you're tired from your journey, inazuma's a great place to come and rest.
as for that aventurine... welt, i'd like to hear your thoughts.
surprised? my reasons are pretty simple.
well, it appears that you are still unable to give explanations for several details about how the nameless got involved in the ambrosial arbor crisis.
i'm afraid so. but you'll have clara and me to keep you company.
while we're waiting for the auction to begin, feel free to check out the lots or just stretch your legs.
later, there was speculation that all of these misfortunes stemmed from some background machinations, meaning that someone wanted to wipe out the raiden gokaden.
of course! the conditions and facilities are first-class, and it's very comfortable here.
i see. no wonder those assistananas only want to teach students one on one...
it is true that their actions and even their entire lives may seem pointless from our perspective, but if, and it's just an "if"...
even if not completely similar, this story you just told... it overlaps with my past. and within that abyssal dream...
we've got your back! we failed to convince topaz, but this should be a piece of cake!
hmm... could be a problem... there sure are a lot...
yup, got it. say no more. sure thing.
since you've come this far, why don't you do one last thing for me, hmm? i'll need your help with the ritual.
is that some kind of riddle? "reverence to the three talons..." what the heck does that mean?
that path may have been more ordinary and challenging, but now he's in a comatose state, and the "sweet dream" has become a sort of end-of-life care. his fate... is sealed.
are you really from the divination commission?
you look much maturer now, yanqing.
from the right angle, you can make out the whole thing.
i overheard you telling yourself that you must be patient and avoid contact with humans.
if there's one thing i'm confident in, it's my gaming skills!
this is also the spirit of the trailblaze. now, everyone, let's prepare to move out.
what kind of trick did they use? when we were tracking them earlier, they looked just like normal xianzhou foxians...
i thought things were finally looking up as i managed to dodge prison during my recent trailblazing expeditions! but now it looks like i'll be back behind bars again...
there's good news and bad news written on the last few pages.
ahh, juice... if i say the word, i get a craving. if i get a craving, i wanna drink some. and if i drink some... ahh... i can't stop!
well, if it isn't franz, long time no see! you're still watching the entrance?
don't worry, she's alright! it took a big toll on bronya, so seele took her over to the guards.
oh, looks like someone's got a knack for this! perhaps we'll have to raise the difficulty a little.
you two on the other hand, have no business coming to wuwang hill. you being here is not normal.
thanks, huohuo! you've already been a huge help by teaching me how to use the exorcising tools! even though i've only been learning swordplay for a short time, i'm confident i can take down the ipc mechs.
hah, you guys sure have a lot to say about that broken heater.
the song that played from the phonograph just now had a breathtaking power.
um, anyway, i was worried that my evaluation would be too subjective if only i were involved. thankfully, i ran into sucrose the other day on her way out of the lab...
she told me her price, but...
or how about this -- i'll invest in you early on, before you make it big.
right on! i'm stealing that!
exactly! i prefer the cool, calm and ruthless way of doing things - that's my kind of style!
during the archon war, piles of corpses covered the wilderness. people were plunged into misery and suffering. disease was spreading all over the land. death devastated the world of the living.
i need to look into the constellation issue in more detail. in the meantime, let me know asap if you find anything else out.
thanks for introducing yourself, mister giovanni di... something something...
the goal is to see how much mora we can make under these conditions.
fine. since my disciple has put in so much time and effort, i must -- with great difficulty -- accept.
i have no doubt that they will. this dish is exquisite.
and after this, whether you can return from the abyss... is another gamble of yours.
suit yourself. worst-case scenario, all we stand to lose is ei, so what's the big deal?
are you kidding!? nuh-uh, no way!
i'm surprised the vagrants in the great mine go after the mining teams, they must be desperate.
we are just friends, i don't see what sheltering has to do with it. tell your subordinates to leave, we have things to discuss.
oh, remember that big one that went up first? the gold one?
no need, why don't you just take us to the city? we don't really know the way.
every participant in this auction was hand-picked by me, based on certain intelligence.
i should not have left it this late to make this promise. but from this moment forth, know that i shall be true to my word.
in that case, what's next on the schedule?
well, don't mind me. find a place to sit down and buckle up.
true, but i've kept that in mind too! that's why everyone here today is in one way or another acquainted with elemental power.
*gasp* did you see that? i think something's moving...
but the problem is: on the eve of the charmony festival opening, how exactly are we going to get close to the theater? family security will be airtight, and if we brute force it... even if we succeed, it's too risky.
but our captain here has seen a lot more of the world, so she's not exactly thrilled with this little tavern.
however, i feared that you would be hesitant to strike me, so i used the identity of the shogun.
(old hag... i guess you do deserve the title of trismegistus after all.)
what's that? you want to open it now?
you are a visitor from far away. you should be welcomed by me and by mondstadt.
oh, yeah... ah geez, this is gonna be a tough case to crack if even my instincts are off...
selling everything you had? why would you go to such lengths?
and that's... the end? there's nothing else in the operations log?
i believe i now understand the situation.
ugh... sorry for crashing your artist party, but we came to talk to you about something else...
the great mine's just down here. the ipc should have the venue all sorted by now.
perhaps it is something that you cannot know right now...
n--no! the express is strong -- i'm sure we can think of something!
for me, a battle is just a form of exercise. a way to keep fit and use up any surplus energy.
oh, don't say that. besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
again... i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
i'll give you a clue: she's currently in charge of the shogun's army, she visits the shrine at this time every month, and she is our guest today.
the kujou clan has undergone a dramatic change from its glory days to its present decline. kamaji is hardly a great heir to the kujou name, but...
...darn, can't activate it. it seems like someone's severed the energy supply to the terminals.
looking at these contestants, i suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason...
that ipc guy will show up in fifteen days. i've got to become a swordmaster by then!
are you saying... you suspect that the family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?
it looks so much like dan heng... i wonder if...
she's also in the running for the legacy... how is she going to sneak into the dreamscape unnoticed?
who's in charge here? how can they just let kids attack each other...?
i'd say it's unlikely. i guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
of course i -- did. he was all serious when he said i would encounter a future "full of dramatic tension" in dreamweaver academy. it made me really curious.
i'm sorry things are getting all bleak and serious... let me see what i can do to lighten the mood.
um... she's taking this really seriously. is this what people call chuunibyou?
the supreme guardian's order was to arrest them. we cannot abandon our pursuit just because they fled into a sealed off area. i must ascertain their fate with my own eyes.
is this... anything to do with kafka?
...maybe you're right, or not. right now i just... need more time to think.
if breaking through from the inside proves challenging, we can seek assistance from the outside. we've long been aware of a potential solution.
dessert club? did you make all these yourself? that's awesome!
leave that to me! i'll figure out a way to persuade her to... ah, to not work so hard all the time, so that i can introduce you to each other!
the ideal spot for a little meet-and-greet with a certain elusive author. this is the place where we are most likely to succeed in summoning the spirit.
yeah, i'm counting on you.
i came up with the design, but i was never able to build it -- some of the raw materials were either too expensive or too hard to get a hold of. she helped me turn the concept into reality.
*sigh* even mister yang looks surprised -- that's not something you see every day.
hee-hee, moon's out, and so am i!
since this is your first time here, i say we start with the easiest games. the dreamy slots and lucky wheel are pretty straightforward.
you'll never defeat me if you're too gentle, you know?
no, of course not! i--i just mean... i admire those who are able to do as they please.
is there anything else in your "script" about me? i'd like to know what kind of footnote "i" get to leave in that future foreseen by destiny?
oh. so what? you did offer to treat me to a meal, didn't you? anyway, i am something of a vip, you know. wouldn't you find it embarrassing to treat me anything short of lavishly?
(ahem... what's wrong with a quick route, mister yang?)
good. i'll have someone attend to this shortly.
after taking a closer look, it seems to me that most of the island mountains contain water veins and plants in their interior. those together form a system that connects the mountains with one another.
the universe is vast beyond our imagination. it's a miracle that our paths converge. the fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
i want to re-live that time from my life, feel some of that drive again. take a trip down memory lane.
she summoned me last night to tell me that you had deceived her. your identities and purpose here are counterfeit. you seek to overthrow the rule of the architects.
...then one day, i will become a knight that i can be proud of.
tower? you mean, that tower over there?
it's okay. i find it quite interesting. i didn't realize that this was how ordinary people viewed the shogun.
there was no way i could console myself... so why bother trying?
as the raindrops tumble from the crimson leaves, their pitter-patter on my umbrella whispers gently to me. in these moments... i find brief serenity.
the victor is clear. seems you require more practice.
which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side... maybe even the same person.
...what's he talking about?
but in the end, i keep finding new ways in which i'm not prepared, and that makes me even more nervous.
...the land of the exiles, concealed by the family under the guise of "death", a dream within a dream where penacony's past is buried.
that's right. you can't build a dreamscape that's not anchored to reality.
yay! everything worked out perfectly. now we just need to wait for an update from the yae publishing house.
allow me to explain.
mister yang's instinct was right all along -- luocha is a villain! how could he do this? tearing up a book as well-written as the angler mystery... unacceptable!
alright, take him to get some rest. he's very weak right now, having been possessed for quite a few days.
the next target is... an eye of the storm!?
abolishing the sakoku decree has a myriad of implications. it would be folly to say that it will be all positive, and there will be no negative repercussions.
...yes, it was a dream. i had a dream on my way here, and i think you were in it... a blink of a thought in my head...
instead of resorting to such despicable methods!
...that would certainly put my mind at rest...
that guy sure has a mysterious past. we gotta take this opportunity on the luofu to dig into it!
well, that's that. but it is gonna be hard to let go of this bazooka...
besides, can you really bear the thought of leaving her here all by herself?
people don't usually notice the drummer, but if you miss a beat, everyone feels it. i like the challenge.
when this happens, the best thing you can do is have a bite to eat and take a proper break.
y'know, when you were passed out, all i thought was i had to look after you. and then you picked up the bat! just incredible!
i need to stay in an undisturbed environment. so, i will leave the investigating to you.
makoto also enjoyed playing akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura when she was alive. hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
huh? i thought i told you once before? wangsheng funeral parlor was first founded to fight back against the vengeful wrath of gods defeated in war.
i know that's the most realistic conclusion, and it's not like luck has to be on my side.
for example... by sending him a little gift. even quinn would notice the difference a gift would bring!
yes, please make sure they are the most difficult!
someone looking for me? who is it?
that should certainly help you on your journey, don't you agree?
you're right. it's credible that the leader of the stellaron hunters can predict the future, but kafka might not be telling the truth.
awesome! lynxy, look! it's a geomarrow activation component! i never thought we'd find one here!
still, if that's how i beat him... it'd be a little less... satisfying.
anyway, sucrose is a true professional when it comes to this kind of research! i showed her my list, and she made some extremely valuable suggestions...
mister giovanni, have you been deliberately guiding us towards a certain goal?
what about veronique... will she be okay?
you can keep exploring the festival while we're busy in the shop. we'll be here when you get back.
that was the only time i ever saw him. and that was more than three years ago, which means... he's no longer alive.
belobog's history and culture museum was founded six hundred years ago, and was originally built to memorialize supreme guardian alisa...
the style and color of the wig...
no way. as long as lynxy can protect herself, i'll be supportive in all her ventures!
it's not so bad... at least i know it has to do with the garden of recollection, right?
mm-hmm, you bet! you might not believe this, but we summoned up all our strength, and then...
this kind of event doesn't come around every day -- why shouldn't i dress for the occasion? ...you're not really gonna wear that same old outfit... are you?
...so the truth is clear now, right?
i, of course, agreed. i can take advantage of the festival-period discounts to purchase some bulk supplies for my present column-writing spree.
also, i--it's not like i'm never coming back. and if i really miss him... i can just pester the heck outta him over the phone, right?
even so... outside of astrology, outside of the words of truth, i still cling to the wisp of an irrational fantasy.
are these floating mantras the inner voices of those ninja initiates? it seems the fiendling chief's beguiling isn't the only reason they gave up on the way of the ninja.
dan heng won't be going anywhere for a while -- he's still resting up, so... wanna come with us?
i'm not so sure about that. slow down a bit.
now you're bringing my great-uncle into this? baizhu... just what are you planning this time?
aw, this isn't good... can you try harder? i'm sure you can at least remember your name...
really? you jumped just now -- it was really sudden, too.
go running around, right? well, your general gave us an errand, so i'm afraid we have to.
come on, let's go. just think of it as... keeping me company for a while!
looks like i'm quite famous on the xianzhou luofu, too.
perhaps this is the truth sunday is trying to express, if you read between lines. the harmony changed penacony just as the guards once did.
hmm... five days ago, you say...
...such a huge area.
confidence goes a long way.
hehe. you've also helped us a lot, so don't be so humble! to be honest, we didn't know where to start with the urstone.
you're too kind, they deserve the real credit. i doubt i'd have come back in one piece without them.
um, based on the knights' schedule, i think it should be... half a year from now.
ah, i see. well, that can be fixed. i'll just have the yashiro commission order a few hundred cups and go door-to-door delivering them.
come on, i've told you my story -- now it's your turn. shouldn't you offer me something in exchange?
this one's attitude changed faster than the people you use clockwork on...
all this talk about food is making me hungry.
great minds really do think alike!
welcome back. i appreciate your help more than i can express -- it couldn't have been easy running all over the city.
oh, is this the marketplace? it's a far cry from how i remember it.
eradicating evil, till my last breath. my bow drawn, no turning back. my heart shall remain unmoved until evil has been purged and justice enacted!
you have a clever tongue. i like it.
ah! you're just like mister yang, always worrying about things that haven't even happened yet.
...yes, i plead guilty.
calm down. between the three of us, nothing will stand in our way.
all right. i don't have a problem with that.
it looked similar, but it can't be, right?
that's because you have too many unrealistic fantasies about astrology.
indeed... it seems that you understood what i meant to say from the very beginning.
the aim is to try not to get hit by the attacks. since you've escaped certain death at her hand once already, i presume this shouldn't be more than you can handle?
but before we accomplish that goal, i humbly ask you to follow me into the future...
hehe, i was just joking. anyway, i should be the one treating you. the funeral parlor is about to bring in quite the sum, after all.
we just so happened to arrive during this... invasion. of course, as a -- ahem -- crew of heroes, we're happy to lend a hand.
people still use mora in commercial transactions, i assume?
and i, in turn, will tell you how i really think.
they embody life's delights and pleasures, but are equally fragile and short-lived... such regret is inevitable, so let it be.
let me see... ah yes, i've been expecting this.
i forgot to introduce myself. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
it's been thirty years since we last saw each other, right, yukong?
have fun, you two. i'll have the tent set up soon.
fortunately, however, the weinlesefest is upon us. a festival during which not only are wines sold at discounted prices, but also wine-related food products.
and obviously i played my part, too.
hm... would you like to exchange views on the art of tea-making?
wide open space... clear sky...
if i want to become a knight, i need to take all aspects of training seriously.
well, she did make mention of being able to "afford a room"... didn't she?
well... in fact, i myself am competing in the tournament.
being in a constant state of alert will only tire us further, perhaps a period of rest is in order.
mm, there's certainly no rush. this trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
something feels off... we're in the right place, right?
yes, of course, absolutely, i'll just go and look at the flowers, or something... but i will be back in an instant at the first sign that something's amiss.
a bunch of them have bad endings, though. like, oh -- the fire diamond will get put in a rich person's gallery, where it will never be ignited again.
*sigh* it looks like every second i have between now and my exam is going to count.
...use a lie to conceal a lie. but if i do that, then...
no no no, the "business development" ended after the discussion with the adventurers' guild!
indulge my curiosity. what is the reason that i find you standing here before me once again?
the annual express spring cleaning? i love tidying rooms! i'll clean everywhere as best i can!
miss black swan, the express is willing to cooperate with you -- we need a proper guide to navigate the memory zone.
have you ever kept goldfish as pets? they're very cute.
uh... you still remember that?
thank you for the repair, xingxi. this is a great help.
if i'd known there were so many high-tech wonders on the express, i probably would've insisted on going with you guys.
why would i think that? i'm just doing what a maid of favonius should do.
relax, we got this. right, dan heng?
not at all. it may look like ice, but it's actually a monument carved out of geomarrow crystal.
if this theory is correct, little layla's wish may yet come true. once you've gotten to know each other, you'll be able to freely communicate without using the wisdom orb.
hand over hoolay's remains to the xianzhou yaoqing, and i'll handle the explanations to the alliance.
alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the overworld and the underworld, right?
alright slowpoke, i'll wait for you here.
this seems like something right up my alley. i can even inquire with "the ones who no longer speak" for you.
the story certainly goes in an unorthodox direction. and the dragon-girl sounds destined to be a hit character. approved!
not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the penacony grand theater has now moved to the radiant feldspar -- the very airship you all stand upon.
we were just talking to her in the museum... do you think her cronies are acting without her authorization?
but the trailblazing expedition ahead is always full of unknowns, and my blade is sharp enough to sever fate... as long as we maintain our original resolve, i believe there will come a day when we will meet again.
is that so? i'm afraid you're just overthinking things.
but see the final product for yourself -- not too shabby, is it?
...i'm a kind of allergic to those types of situations. i think i'll just head back to my room and start packing.
we trailblazers can go days without sleep, but when we do hit the hay, we have to make up for it. anyway, no point wasting our time in the corridor.
don't worry, there's enough to go around! on the house -- order whatever you like.
next up, everyone will select the destination that they wish to visit. and then, we'll put it to a vote.
back so soon... a true senior knight!
oh dear, the poor thing still hasn't realized.
and so... it falls to me to place the truth before your eyes, in all its ugliness.
i think i'll stay here for a bit longer. the show is still not quite over in my heart.
don't worry! i can't stand by and watch someone be bullied. i have to stand up against injustice, no matter what!
it's not too hard once you figure it out.
all that time we spent together... was any of it real?
i seldom had the time to drink tea. any free time i had was spent practicing martial arts.
obviously! how could "light cone me" be cuter than actual me?
well, seeing as we've come this far...
oh? well then we should at least go and file a report with the knights--
is it possible that the time has not come yet?
when the master diviner gets back, we might be in for tough times... it's making me a little nervous.
what does it matter? don't worry about it, it's all part of the fun.
from the present station and movement of the stars... i see, so that successor is a young... female... knight of favonius.
hmm... no, i must approach this question differently... is there anything here that requires specific environmental conditions in order to grow? conditions that wolvendom cannot provide?
i am no longer pursuing an eternity defined by stasis. in which case, there is no further need to keep the nation under lock and key.
well, waking up after a great sleep in a comfy bed to find out you're a wanted criminal... tends to leave a deep impression.
i'm simply bringing up the doubts about general jing yuan that exist within the alliance. since i'm representing them, perhaps you can just imagine me as one of those old geezers?
dad says that inspiration is a combination of what you see and what you know. different people can see the same thing but have different thoughts.
i can't deny that i am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his vision, but i rather think the shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him... okay, fine. i'll give it some more thought.
i just... feel a bit empty now that we've lost the stellaron -- i spent a long time pursuing it, after all...
alright then, is everyone clear about their assignments? good. we are running out of time, so let's get moving! chop chop!
hee-hee, thanks to little diting, we didn't have to break and enter.
well, i--i am a genius astrologist, after all. of course my mirage was going to be magnificent...
(you know how evildoers can be -- sometimes they have a higher purpose than just money. it's only natural he'd try everything to achieve that purpose.)
i was always looking forward to the day she'd return this guitar... i thought that would be the day we could bury the hatchet.
it's getting late. i won't take up any more of your time. you're all free to go as you please.
that's why i want to help her. her world is still very small -- too small for all the sadness she has to bear.
i'm not trying to talk our way out of this, but... we're not friends with that scoundrel. did you see how fast he ditched us?
your wishes will always be remembered by someone.
la~la~la~ steamed fish with a side of prawn dumplings~
besides, choosing me means you'll have one less tough competitor to deal with, hehe! anyway, give it some thought.
stop! i know what you're gonna say: "march, you said too much back there -- march, you shouldn't reveal our goal to people we don't trust..." meanwhile you guys were beating around the bush and speaking in riddles.
i have read your letter word for word, miss topaz, and your childhood experiences truly touched me.
why don't you weigh the pros and cons and give me a clear answer before i retract my offer.
i need to make fireworks not just for you guys, but for those kids and sakujirou as well. we're missing a lot of materials.
shh! quiet! just sit tight and watch for a moment...
so that's rock music, huh? it's a little different than i imagined.
as i said, our plan is not about convincing everyone to choose the right path, but about inspiring them to save themselves. so, when will people actively save themselves?
do you remember what i told you before? hunting is about thinking in the same way as your prey, not just mindlessly chasing after them.
the ability to communicate with the stars can give you access to all the secrets from throughout human history... though of course, very few astrologists ever reach that level.
very well. now, please close your eyes...
haha, you've no need to worry.
but it's dangerous around here. we'd better travel together.
i know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but penacony is actually in danger right now... we have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
with your powers being so diminished, it was only natural that you didn't notice me.
ugh, look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
someone from the garden of recollection is here? on the express...?
haha. interesting. yes, we have a special relationship, but i don't see anything unusual about it.
yeah! of course, at times like this we're so lucky to have our crew. the family and the ipc -- everyone has their own plans going on...
so klee's mother is a writer? huh.
ho? so this is pilos peak? not much to show for itself now, eh?
we're not late to the party, right? right?
hm, just as i thought, the ritual went very smoothly. thank you both.
i sense the time and effort that you have put into this place, which reminds me of the time and effort i myself spent when constructing the jade chamber.
perhaps it's just my wishful thinking, but i think she did this deliberately, as her way of keeping our friendship eternal.
an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards... and the stench of death in the air.
i would like to continue walking through the forest for a while. will you accompany me?
how will i know if i don't try? all possibilities exist until the outcome actually happens, right?
"acheron..." merely a borrowed name. you know my nature, remember my deeds... thus, i am acheron.
i... i understand. it's only right to return the favors i receive!
so even though my secretaries are very capable and experienced, i still can't help worrying for them a little.
i noticed it also. just now, in the heat of battle, it seemed to unleash a new and unfamiliar power.
...so it should be okay to include in your book...
according to the notebook, their name is "tsubaki." this seems to have been someone very important to my mother. someone with a lot of personality, who liked to have fun.
no no no, i'm terrible at singing... it would be extremely embarrassing if it didn't work.
you're not dreaming. we're in the reverie hotel, in the real world. the order's dream is over.
but aren't you doing that right now? falling for the trap.
n--no, why would anything have happened?
r--right... then maybe i can give it a try.
i'm afraid a baseball bat isn't an efficient weapon... no! what i mean is, we can't solve the problem with violence...
and now that i look around, this is chinju forest as i have always known it. after making it here, it doesn't seem nearly as frightening.
i have high hopes, though. this seems like miko's style, so i'm sure the stories are very entertaining.
oh? you'd give me time to enjoy a meal but not yourself?
however, someone had already been on the scene before we arrived.
we didn't speak all that much... you know how it is, i can only talk to dad for so long before i start losing it.
we haven't a moment to spare. our battle begins now!
...all of them contain detailed records of the experience of love! as a maid, my experience leaves a lot to be desired, so i found the quickest way was to take examples from the classics!
we have always been following in the footsteps of our nameless predecessors, and there's no reason to stop now.
seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist... humans traverse the path of fate.
so you're saying there's nothing to worry about? but bronya...
that aside -- as i'm sure you're aware, i'm afraid that i won't always be able to help you in such circumstances.
lady bronya, we never saw it like that...
hahaha. come on, in we go.
first of all, i'm an adult. second, i didn't just break in...
that's alright! you've helped me so much already, master diviner. i owe you a big one.
your existence is more than just an opportunity. it's the very key to all of this. to that i say... well done, child, you did not disappoint me after all.
ultimately, it's up to you, supreme guardian, to make the final call.
oooh this is hard! what else should i take...
"a nation to last for all eternity" is a dream that she and i both share. but i don't think that's the same thing as complete stasis.
but... you know that only a few things can be brought back from the dreamscape to reality, right?
since i was the subject of the bet, perhaps it should go to me? you know, as a congratulations for the huge deal i just struck.
anyway, did anything interesting come up while you were out scouting?
hehe, don't ever question my professional instincts!
oh! and why don't you take some fireworks with you as well? i just finished creating a new design that's both pretty and relatively quiet. i'm sure your siblings are gonna love it!
may your love be as free as a dandelion...
it's just, i was really getting into the camping! i felt like i finally got around to doing the things i always wanted to...
if it's a trial prepared by ninja initiate gigaku, i see no reason to refuse.
truthfully, i've never heard of this stellaron.
imagine myself passing the exam...? hmm...
in the end, we still came full circle.
we've met so many people on our journey, there's no way we'll be able to narrow it down...
i shall return to tenshukaku. miko told me that the test of courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
such is the herta company culture...
that's two down already! but seriously, i can't help but notice how... confusing this place is...
huh? a supernatural tales anthology! sounds like a good bedtime read... might stop me daring to run to the bathroom at night though...
traveler, paimon, it seems you've also heard about the results.
we've kept your appointment, mister aventurine. it is customary to show yourself as well.
i never imagined that i, hu tao, could ever be like this. energy like a rushing torrent, a heart soaring like a gliding eagle! i feel great!
you've been explaining a lot about the venue, but i'm still confused about the game. can we actually give it a go?
i think we did everything we could to make you happy, big g, wouldn't you say?
anyway. you're looking for a chance to shake my will... aren't you?
yes, that cartoon character. i think he's shown up in reality -- i mean -- in the dreamscape.
yes... maybe it's because i'm not afraid anymore...
guess what! something weird just happened when i was on my way over here. someone gave me a strange gift.
i also heard that when dreamflux reef took shape, it was the center of all dreamscapes in penacony.
two greedy fishies struggling to swim, they ate so much that they're starting to groan.
please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
everyone, please follow me to the scene of the crime. the investigation starts there...
since miss firefly has said her piece, the astral express will also naturally give you our answer.
...are you wondering if the xianzhou is my homeworld?
counterfeits? absolutely not. what motive would anyone have for making copies of things like these?
now that you've decided, i don't have to pretend to be impartial anymore. i think you're making the right choice, bronya.
i'm just here to talk business. so, are you in business or not?
i don't understand... even if the truth is as you say, every generation of guardian has resisted the call of the stellaron...
one client, two clients, three clients!
how did you know that was perkins...
if it's so simple, why didn't your master diviner come and do it herself?
i know that he might be dangerous... but he saved iwao, and the kids all warmed up to him right away. he even happily agreed to help us find the great mujina youkai.
if there really is a traitor within the family... that person must hold a high position or possess unimaginable strength.
but if people don't live for the future, do they merely exist for survival? if even you, my brother, don't believe that the harmony will save the weak, then which aeon can make our dreams come true?
then let's proceed together to the end of this dream... and tell mikhail our decision.
"down on the ground the dice spin around, while high in the sky the sun shines bright"... hmm, that last line could use some work...
i have a friend -- they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
it hasn't closed yet, it's just that there aren't many people left... let's hurry and see as much as we can!
*chuckles* don't mention it. welt and i may have stayed on the express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on jarilo-vi.
huh? the vidyadhara? you mean these pearls will turn into people?
young people should be energetic! here, let's do some relaxation exercises.
i see... you really made no effort to correct your mistakes, cocolia...
*sigh* seeing you again is a change to eternity... and a very nice surprise.
or... we could ask around? look how busy this place is, someone must have seen miss tingyun. that's not cheating, right? we're just collecting intel.
you don't have to emphasize the "seven hundred years" part, y'know...
life is as fleeting as night dew, hard to sever from the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death... baseball bat ninja, yoroshiku.
but you don't belong to this world. perhaps you are just the company she needs.
as you can see, after nearly one hundred days of renovation, the interior looks brand new.
i'm already very happy that i get to visit your express like this once in a while.
i am the arrow that pierces the wolf's heart. i grant you a swift death.
if this rain keeps up, my fur will be dripping wet...
yes. that soldier was one of the many thousands who made the ultimate sacrifice. what he was describing just now was precisely the disaster that happened in inazuma five hundred years ago.
i mean no offense. i simply hope that our adepti forebearers would see liyue in a new light.
someday, they may realize that not everything is a win-win deal, that deception and one-upmanship are facts of life. but there's nothing wrong with that.
but no matter how gepard and i asked and probed, lynx simply refused to tell us who she was gonna meet... *sigh* i'm such a failure of a sister.
if you want me to appoint a new clan, then naturally, there must first be a new duel.
no, no... that's not what i meant...
so it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
do i even need to say it? i think we're becoming fast friends... isn't that enough?
i have added the memory from earlier into this. if ninja gama does not lie, this will become the blade to slay those fiendlings.
since there is such a great deal of difference between the story and the reality, i don't feel offended at all. on the contrary, i find the author's powers of imagination quite admirable.
oh, serval! so she's gepard's older sister!
oh, we have an expert among us! hey, why don't you play a match with me? it'll help me warm up, and maybe find some creative inspiration.
can you see that building in the distance? that's the famous grand theater, another great landmark of penacony!
first of all, it's not me. secondly, i don't make friends just for the sake of gossip.
hah. well, i'm afraid i'm having far too much fun to stop what i'm doing and start bickering with you, captain.
how could something so beautiful be unsafe?
thank you... that makes me so happy!
do you remember the invite that the express received?
hehe, far from it, haniyyah. i know full well how serious you are about all this from your iron-clad determination to annihilate an entire species... how would i ever dare mock you?
you're talking weird again... but it's a good vibe. no matter what, we can't ignore the safety of penacony.
it's understandable to think that way. and in the vast majority of cases, you'd be completely right.
gah, so you're leading us on another wild goose chase?
haha, i knew i could count on you!
hehe, this is a pretty big ask~
right... uh, what i meant was... i kind of envy you, seele.
but he's not the only evil ninja in this realm, right?
what's so unusual about it? they simply received an invitation from jing yuan, just like the crew, right?
i really should thank you two, though. you set all this up as a backup plan because you knew that meteor showers are hard to catch, right?
uh-huh! like i was some kind of weird alien! i don't really blame them for being curious though -- they had no idea where i came from.
if i'm not here to help... i don't know what might happen in the next wave.
well, in my opinion, sunday is deeply committed to his own philosophy and genuinely wants to prove that the order is right.
as the one who shook eternity, you are her potential for change.
...i did wanna say something, though. umm, i don't think mister yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct...
hmph, such an absurd question betrays your ignorance.
whenever you start going off on a misguided tangent, i'll correct you. and if you're ever stuck in a rut, i'll give you a little nudge towards the next chapter.
this is the only way i can ensure everyone's safety...
dunn, this concerns the fate of belobog -- no -- the fate of our whole world. please don't stand in our way...
you saw those two. one thinks he's been cursed, the other one believes his friend's turned into an evil spirit. it's hard to reason with them.
just my conjecture, but i doubt it's far from the truth. my brother mentioned that they've had to use extreme measures to repel the fragmentum monsters.
all of this was so encouraging to hear. it made me feel that my dear old companion's sacrifice was not in vain.
"uhhh! umm... ummm..."? your brother is your closest relative. you must have noticed straight away when he started acting out of character.
umm... i've never met svarog before. i heard he's not easy to get along with...
ever since the adepti left liyue harbor in the hands of mortals, we qixing have taken up the responsibility of leading the people.
you'll see shortly. the one who spent the most money will surely be the quickest to realize.
of course, casually performing divination for fun might be a different matter, but in my field of expertise, there's no room for lies.
but, i am a genius, so it's only fair that i'm able to accomplish what others cannot.
i had to scare them a little, though. otherwise i hardly think these two lazy rascals would have learned their lesson.
maybe so. in any case, i'm not gonna be the one who exposes it.
quite literally. and had she not lent him a hand and pulled him up, he would've gone tumbling down the cliffside...
maybe that's why the trailblaze chose such a look.
we may not be able to decide our lives, but the dreamscape is doomed to be just a dreamscape. for those who fall into the abyss, i can only hope to help them heal and return to reality in peace...
secret concoctions of concealed evil. it contains an excessive amount of ninja strength. swallowing it means enduring bone-shattering pain.
or to put it another way, seeing your reaction was exactly what i wanted to do.
both masters are super strict, giving me a real taste of how hard sword training can be.
ah! of... of course! it's a maid's responsibility to help the residents of mondstadt!
rest assured, i am not prone to misjudgment.
okay... where to next?
as such, i have been putting eyes and ears out ever since you reached liyue...
such privileges exist due to the yashiro commission's role in managing ceremonial affairs. oftentimes, it is not appropriate to discuss details in front of bystanders.
...the illusion was so impossibly blissful that i realized it was just a dream.
hmm... using the ipc's cutting-edge aether copying technology, we can record any creature you've seen inside of an aether coin...
hardly. isn't this the fashion these days? "bring the service to the customer," and all that?
ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? sure, i'll take one.
hohoho, they say roosters crow at first light, and finches go to bed at night, but director hu tao's always on the ball -- anytime, anywhere, she'll answer your call!
oh, hello. miko told me about the test of courage event taking place here. i thought i would come and have a look.
argh, sorry. old habits die hard...
but be sure to book the right date! pro tip: it is a living nightmare trying to get flowers at short notice...
it was the story of windrise and lady vennessa...
this shrine looks somewhat familiar.
oh -- and i wish you a pleasant and enjoyable irodori festival.
allowing the rite of parting to take place was also meant to buy some time for us to take control of liyue's administration...
yeah, i've not only learned swordplay from masters, but i've also met a bunch of people and gained a lot of insights from my experiences.
does this mean that you need uniforms like those to get in and out of the akademiya?
are those monsters guarding the energy hub?
human life is short. enjoy it while it lasts.
we'll take the stage by storm, with flames roaring, and the whole audience calling for more!
fate has brought us together, so c'mon, take a seat and be my guest! help yourself, i'll ask them for another set of cutlery.
that cloud knight didn't recognize master yanqing at all... that's really weird.
doctor natasha said that she's a handful, but that she also takes care of the homeless kids. maybe she's more mature than she seems?
but the human body has its limits, and so does the divine's.
still, it'd be quite inconvenient if i can't move freely. could you help me out, silver wolf?
besides, the yae publishing house will need your help with the illustrations again next time, mister calx. you could also consider it as my investment in you.
it sounds... like a flawless theory...
so when i say this "curse" is just a figment of the imagination, i say it with more certainty than most. but i also can't really go telling people that the ancient plagues were real, or it would incite panic.
witness our decision?
we didn't have an enjoyable stay the last time, though...
oh? looks like someone's learned a thing or two from zhongli.
given the situation on the luofu, those on the yaoqing are concerned about hoolay's imprisonment. i'm afraid that the routine visit every century is no longer sufficient to ease their concerns.
saika loves tricolor dango, but the adults in her family always scold her for eating too many and spoiling her appetite.
the damage caused by the ambrosial arbor crisis was far less severe than expected, which is good news for us. however... it was quite different from the ruin legion's usual style of destroying life wherever they go.
it'll be fine. escaping in a boat is just a last resort for if there's no other way. i'll still try and come up with a different solution, because it'd be much better if you could stay in inazuma.
come, we need to lock up hoolay once again before anything unexpected happens.
but i can't just stand by and watch mister gopher wood become an enemy of the harmony. i won't use my voice to support an evil cause...
would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express, just to listen to music?
that's right! now, if there are no more questions, it's time to reveal the first riddle!
there's nothing to worry about. we just need to go through the schedule you made and tick the items off one by one.
what am i gonna do... why did miss fu xuan pick the scariest time to vanish...
that's fine. thank you for your hard work.
when we're healthy, it's easy to forget the crushing fragility of life. so... aches and pains. best to keep an eye on them.
hah, you're absolutely right. perhaps they occasionally best the shogun's army in open battle, but when they face the raiden shogun herself...
no, nothing... maybe i'm just overthinking things... however, if this traitor really exists, could they be responsible for firefly and robin's deaths?
all of this is thanks to makoto's power. her understanding of eternity is much more profound than mine.
so, if people start creating trouble for us, they're gonna regret it!
borisin must have actually infiltrated the skysplitter. based on general huaiyan's orders... it's time for me to take action.
hi, kazuha, i'm absolutely delighted to meet a great swordmaster like you. could we ask you to be our guard while we're on the island?
should we wait here, or go find the messenger from the divination commission?
that oleg... he seems sincere. what do you guys think?
(no, that's pu'er, the tea society's gatekeeper.)
yeah, that's usually how it goes.
why do you think i've come here? we've found a way to dispel the eternal freeze, to seal the fragmentum. it might be the only lifeline this world has left!
right this moment, you and i have coincidentally shared the same dreamscape, and appeared in each other's minds. this is the land of dreams's inaugural welcome for us.
alright... i hope i can find some intel that proves useful to mondstadt...
wait, don't go any closer.
that uniform... was it him that texted you?
just names and occupations? and they don't even sound like their real names either... this will be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
or to put it another way, i... i--i actually have another side to myself as well.
ah, you can see falcon coast from here! such a beautiful view!
i'm sorry... we have an understanding. i stand with them.
but, to be honest, i am even more concerned by what i read in the steambird earlier this morning. it said that... the killer in the murder case was none other than the author of "the two musketeers."
don't worry though, i'm sure i can think of some way to get you feeling relaxed and happy!
dear me, it's nothing that horrendous. you make it sound like i'm some sort of wicked witch.
you don't sound very confident to me. going out of your way to make citywide broadcasts in an attempt to involve more people... you are simply betting on the possibility of someone being able to "break down the barrier."
i... i dunno. she's being a little creepy...
you and origami bird are friends?
(they remembered what i said... aww...)
if i get another chance, i'll practice even harder and won't ever lose again!
ahem. traveler, do you have a moment... to talk?
"moon rage" isn't so much a disease as it is my past and future. one can let go of the past, but must always face the future.
but i still want to do everything within my ability to share the load!
...ahem. i'll pretend i didn't hear that.
i was just drifting out there in space and got picked up by the express. amazing, right?
that's right. also, think about this: everyone gets burnt to ash one day.
...it's as if it's deliberately trying to stop me from seeing how things will end.
press it at just the right moment in the celebration, and there could be an unexpected treat in store for you.
i see... but your lives are so long -- shouldn't career change be easy?
i really thought i had the acting chops! now i have to go pour concrete in dream's edge. it's not fair.
astrologists are able to understand the most complex signs among the stars. and because of this, we are not allowed to show any arrogance.
and the atmosphere here... is completely different from the previous two scenes.
every time i train and compete with the knights, i can't figure out how to use it.
hello everyone, i'm march seventh! i'm an ordinary girl who loves adventures!
this is it! the entrance to the corridor of fading echoes victory zone!
haha, or so it seems...
this is a comfortable environment, a good place to be calm and gather one's thoughts.
ha, that's nothing -- the unannounced disappearance record-holder is right here!
the world of commerce is a battleground, and policy-making requires conviction and decisiveness.
the item that's supposed to be in this exhibit is a modern sculpture called gears and wisdom.
(is it really so far-fetched? we're already assuming that luocha came here to sell the stellaron to a bunch of cut-throats -- may as well throw in some monsters here and there...)
recently, i have observed a number of changes in the external world from the plane of euthymia. the most serious of these being the attack on the sacred sakura by numerous rifthounds.
stand down, moze. i am here, hoolay. what do you wish to say?
let's keep moving forward. what i want to show you is just ahead.
this slope has a good view... it'll be easy to watch the aurora.
that's what i was thinking! you must have picked up a lot of knowledge about different cultures on your travels, hopefully including regional cuisines...
the archon's emissary has a special responsibility in the warrior's spirit event. however, it's hard to describe without touching on the origins of this event.
...okay, i'll... wait here for your return. get back safely.
fiendling puppets imbued with life... the epitome of ninja automation.
in a trade war, the perfect hunter leaves no trace.
uh, that's me talking to myself...
-- i've decided to forego my role, and never step foot on the charmony festival's stage again.
oh, you know zhongli? well! that saves me a lot of explaining.
for it is something that mora cannot buy.
thanks, miss asta. but i... i'm not sure i should...
my brother often hummed a lullaby to help me fall asleep when i was young. that was the first piece of music i learned... even without lyrics, it's still the melody i hold dearest.
wow, that's soooo deep... come on, stop fooling around!
i knew it... no matter. i'll also send a letter to herta and tell her that we've brought the rare item she seeks. at least that might get her attention.
not necessarily. if you ask me...
"on this marvelous lantern rite, we pray that the fallen heroes may be guided home."
team leader? ha, you're even lower on the pecking order than i thought.
but when the kids asked me about it, i didn't wanna break it to them. i just told them that it looks cute, likes to play pranks, and doesn't hurt people.
can i trouble you to access the records?
i think her name was... swetta? yes, that's right. let's go pay her a visit.
...aah! it's delicious! it's the most delicious thing i've eaten recently!
oh, hey you two! it's been a long time, hasn't it?
uh... th--this isn't just hide-and-seek, okay? let me explain...
huh? which next fight?
alright, i'm rested. let's get this journey to mondstadt over with!
hehe. when i say rebellion, i don't mean betraying the shogunate... i mean, inciting a certain someone to betray the tenryou commission.
it's a little bit like... porridge? but the resemblance is only superficial...
these areas are not developed yet, so guests don't come here. it's not as lively as the town center here, but i relish the serene atmosphere.
isn't one of the joys of playing chess to continually learn and progress through a complex set of rules?
if you've got time, shall we take a walk to komore teahouse? to chat about the art of tea on a pleasant day like this seems like the sophisticated thing to do.
signing off now! time to get some songwriting going~
but i've never met her, and if she were still alive, she'd be... well, suffice it to say that the hag's at least a few hundred now, and n's been around for longer than that!
does not a single person dare to face me?
i really loved the trip you prepared for me -- in fact, i'm totally impressed!
why, yes -- it was charlotte! you remember her, right? that daredevil journalist?
ninja initiate gigaku, what ails you?
it's about time. we'll have to get ready for the meeting... i apologize for any inconvenience caused by the urgency.
now to set the record straight with svarog. let's get in there!
as i said, the shogun has a robust system to protect her against modification. this is because i anticipated that i myself would change over time.
...so you promise that if i win hide-and-seek, you'll tell big sister march all the ins and outs.
i, too, have wandered alone, encountering "acquaintances" on strange worlds, seeing their silhouettes overlap with my past.
i've got lots! it's just, i don't know what to choose.
i think it's only right to tell you.
i apologize for my tardiness, once again.
you'll have to wait for us to finish checking in first.
also... processing your own meat products is much cheaper than buying them ready-made.
me and the honorary knight don't have that kind of relationship...
i have heard that things are quite tumultuous within the tenryou commission at present. does this have anything to do with kujou kamaji?
that night, i cried miserably. to this day, i still remember how sad i felt. i don't want klee to feel the same way.
today they do! and you're not dreaming. if you don't believe us, pinch yourself!
but i think you did the right thing. and look, now you've managed to resolve the grievance in your heart by talking about it.
what's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? seems pretty normal to me.
even so, there are still many who would rather be forever immersed in the dreamscape...
i only heard her voice. i wouldn't say i saw her...
the jade chamber offers a splendid panoramic view of the mountains and the bustling city. it is fitting for the finest performance to be hosted in the heavens... i can think of no better stage for you than here, ms. yun.
change of plan. i've decided to stay in belobog.
hmm, i've been on the express for a while but i still don't have any new songwriting inspiration. how strange...
thank you both for your hard work. did you find out anything in the administrative district?
gratitude won't pay your bills, though... don't do this to me, can't we just play by normal business rules here?
now we know he didn't do it on purpose... hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
...then it's a deal. if you go back on your promise, i'm going to bring my silvermane guards with me and catch you myself! here, take the medal and go back to the town. we already took care of any threat on the way. you'll be safe.
i've been to many different worlds, yet i still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. as for its nature, there are a few theories that i can share with you.
i've seen you on the streets of mondstadt occasionally, but i've always been too busy to disturb you...
mere mortal!? do you have any idea who you're talking to? i am a highly accomplished astrologist, thank you very much!
i understand. i'm sorry for dragging you into this mess...
with the front line on high alert, they must have rotated the bridge to make it impassable. then they cut off the energy supply to the terminals to avoid accidental repositioning... or to prevent deserters from escaping.
you know, all those... overpriced, fancy foods. personally, i think it's uncivilized and, frankly, dangerous to splash out and indulge yourself every time you have a little hunger pang.
the child said the fox had started appearing frequently in the village ever since she had fed it some fried tofu.
hmm, i guess you're right... maybe it isn't such a big deal.
after all that she went through, it's good that she finally got to reconcile with herself.
the book contains many ancient "kaidan" -- or tales of the supernatural -- and is written in a very engaging way. that is why the book has become so popular.
ugh, don't do this to me... hearing half a sentence is like developing half a photo. i'll be up all night thinking about it...
i have to say, this has reminded me once again just how brilliant makoto was. she predicted all the ways in which inazuma's future could unfold all the way back then.
careful, these traces are fresh. our unsought guest isn't far away.
i heard that places like dreamflux reef are scattered throughout the memory zone of asdana, like islands in the ocean. they existed before the family arrived.
that's... too difficult. and even if i wanted to stay in mondstadt, it would be...
someone once told me... that every rainfall is like a gift from the heavens, a sign of their mercy upon the world.
are you talking to clockie? ..well, it does look like things are getting out of control...
yes. it seems she has inherited the blood, but not the knowledge... what a miscalculation. there can be no contest like this.
typically, youkai memories survive longer in the world than those of humans.
the atmosphere here is starkly different from the beautiful dream. there are no regulators here like the family, and they all look like they're mildly dazed.
so the next time we visit, we'll be doing so in our capacities as the representatives of the yashiro commission.
don't worry about it. take a rest, we'll be back right away.
excellent! time to get busy-busy again!
i love the scent of wine, and after reading up on the art of wine-making, i have grasped some of the key principles.
oh, ahh, it's nothing! i... i was just thinking that the person who finds that ring must be lucky indeed, to be able to earn twenty thousand mora just like that.
i know merchants in liyue are really good at making mora, they're experts at landing deals both big and small.
perhaps you thought i'd planned an intensive training session for you? heh, that won't be necessary. on the contrary, when you're constantly on edge, you miss quite a lot of important things.
this time, though, i just had them do a simple repair. the item is quite ordinary. in fact, the cost of the repair was more than the item was ever worth.
i'm the least accomplished in swordplay, but i came out unscathed. i really ought to thank my masters for taking all the blows on my behalf.
argh, if i'm not careful the urge to accommodate just takes over...
remember, this is a race against the clock. a rare opportunity presents itself to you... do not let somebody else snatch it from your grasp.
all in black, surely they're not... ipc? on this world? am i going crazy?
now, i'd love to hear your suggestions on how to defeat skott.
still, we hung out every day, it's only natural that my love for inventing would rub off on her.
you kidnapped me and brought me to the underground. what is the meaning of this?
huh?! robin? but i thought she... oh, right! if firefly is here safe and sound, then it means robin must be okay, too.
that girl from wanmin restaurant... her suspicion towards me is always written all over her face... hehe, i wonder what face she would make if only she knew how much i helped finance that restaurant...
yeah, i was wanted on a few occasions too... ehe, maybe a dozen times? never mind, that's not important now.
but... aren't you--?
or do you seriously think northland bank won't throw you to the wolves when push comes to shove?
see! that was easy.
now, time for a change of pace. where should we go?
do you still remember when we first arrived in penacony? who would have thought our paths would cross in such a way.
but there's a strange aura to this place. it's almost as if someone has been staring at me as soon as we stepped foot in here.
the barrier hasn't been fixed yet. don't try and be a hero, gepard!
*sigh* fine, you're right... in that case, we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
the question now is -- who brought you here? based on the clues we have so far, it's unlikely to be that masked fool, so identifying them is crucial to us.
you sure? i really don't think she'll change her mind.
yes. nowadays, the almighty shogun won't attend the exhibition match in person, but she will still send a special envoy to fight on her behalf to display her divine strength.
this is how penacony fell under the family's control. since the arrival of the harmony, the land of the exiles has undergone dramatic changes, not all of which have proven... beneficial.
i know your power more than anyone else. had i relied upon my strength alone, i would have lost this duel for sure.
well... i was just listening to what they had to say. it's not like they managed to convinced me anyway. plus, if they don't talk in rhyme, it's probably just nonsense.
you didn't go spilling the beans, did you, paimon?
not yet, everything looks normal so far. i think the problem is stemming from the energy hub.
what!? this fella's already broken... what should we do, take it with us?
yes, well said. it seems we have the same philosophy on this topic.
ugh, even then, humans only have so much strength. even if they do successfully summon a spirit with the incantation, it won't stay with them for very long. i really wouldn't fret about it.
don't sweat it -- leave them to us.
ugh, do trailblazers not understand sarcasm?
i... must have been chosen from among the children here and then taken to the surface...
that makes him even worse! how dare he use a book that praises justice for his evil plans!
so... what now? we spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!
please, go and talk to her. see if you can offer her any console.
...there's no stopping you once you've made up your mind. fine, we'll do it your way.
maybe it was some form of punishment... but i became lost. i couldn't see the stars any longer.
you can go ahead and chat away. xiangling and i will go have some tea with the boss over there. zhongli, please come get me when you're through here!
but i haven't written much poetry before, so i'm not sure if i'll fit in...
the true story is anyone's guess, but everyone aspires to emulate his success and be the next watchmaker!
do you now realize how dire the consequences of wild speculation can be?
whoa! so that's a xianzhou ship? it looks even bigger than jarilo-vi!
hi there. the name's serval, i'm the owner of this workshop.
oh, good morning, traveler. ...whenever i see you in the morning, somehow, it makes me feel like... today is going to be a good day.
that's true. i hope that becomes a reality one day.
that's possible. you see soulglad everywhere these days, so it wouldn't be a surprise if someone brought a bottle here.
keep going straight down this alley and it'll lead to an elevator. it'll take us to the center of the land of the exiles.
hehe, i've already prepared them, of course.
i see... but that is merely a small goal, based on what preoccupies you here and now.
...we're the ones who're stuck here! we keep going in circles...
your question was written all over your face. now look, you've helped me rebuild the jade chamber, and i intend to repay you handsomely for it.
i know jiaoqiu always wants me to know my limits and not get carried away, but... now is the time to bring this to a swift end.
from the traces they've left in the surrounding area, there should be many more monsters nearby. all of them must be eliminated.
hehe, you flatter me, paimon. if this gift reminds you of me, that is all i could ask for.
wow, that's impressive! hehe, i didn't expect to be introduced to new customers while on vacation.
ah, you don't refuse. may i assume you accept then?
okay. by the way, brother, i heard you no longer have a sweet tooth. back when we were kids, you used to steal my desserts...
that witch! she was here waiting for us the whole time. show yourself, phantylia!
so i have a strong feeling that this will be a tough battle to win.
...she's gone. well, shall we?
so we'll take that elevator on the central platform to go down to the master control zone. do you know the way?
but before i go, can i ask you a question? you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
this feels as awful as purchasing a counterfeit astrology tutorial, or realizing you've forgotten your wallet in the middle of dinner...
it was worth trying to comfort you, even if only a little. i believe that you'll help those who're struggling in the same way i did.
those people we found today were also meng's childhood friends. i thought there was a good chance big g might have hidden among them. but here we are, empty-handed.
for our final stop, i want to leave mister alois with something to commemorate his time here.
unlike me, makoto was no martial artist. whenever similar crises had arisen in the past, i was always the one to face them in her stead.
wow, i can see the resemblance. alright, i'll paint the streets, and klee, you fill in dodoco's colors.
why is it always you that has to take the lead... ugh whatever, it doesn't matter. let's just find this place first.
while i also take issue with aspects of the kanjou commission's operational methods, please remember, mister kurisu, that while you are here in inazuma, you should be careful with your words.
hello everyone! next up, get ready for the mega march seventh adventure, where i'm going to break the speed run world record!
oh, you're amazing, paimon! it looks like i still have a lot of learning to do.
gepard should be waiting for us in rivet town, right?
that's right! i'm your ancestor!
no. as you just pointed out, that kind of thing is easily replaced.
hmm, let me think... if i'm not mistaken, captain kaeya would first get his subject drunk before asking them any questions...
as the raiden shogun they revere, i should not be the one to hold them back.
though blind, furuyama is unparalleled in his ability to appraise tea. he brews some of the very finest tea in all of inazuma.
the guide miss topaz mentioned could have important information for us.
something else i've been wondering is... how do people in other nations dress?
very good. i think i'll host the auction myself.
wait, this is your first trip! so that should be double the excitement, right?
i'm just glad that you are all safe and sound. who knew that such a labyrinth of cases would be behind this story...
hmm, now that you mention it, i should probably get back to my writing. it'd be far too easy to while away the whole day on this game...
penacony is nothing more than a dream. it can't erase the worries and pain of reality or bring true happiness... it only offers an escape from reality. nothing more.
anyway. i'm only telling you this to stop you worrying, so that you can focus... on something i need you to do for me.
i shattered the fiendling's deception with my ninja talismans. has everyone snapped out of their trance?
...huh? and what's that supposed to mean?
that's a really long name!
hmm... i'm really interested to check out this troupe's performance, but it really sounds like the edo star is in a lot of trouble. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
ugh... it feels like mister giovanni has been stringing us along the whole time!
zhongli looks young, but his personality is a bit dusty. knows everything, but doesn't fret over anything. hmm... couldn't be that he's a...hehe, forget it, whatever.
but that does bring me to a question i've been mulling over in my head... do you think there's something else going on in her life?
...you wanna know what happens to people who vandalize exhibits? i call the silvermane guards and they carry you away!
...she disappeared.
could you tell us more about the "compass," misha?
in my experience, a leader needs be able to roll with the punches. that also includes knowing when and what to prioritize.
...to return "his" relics to their rightful owner.
now then, i always have my ways. it's just a question of how crafty i need to be...
the bad news is, persikov failed to revive them, and eventually succumbed to the device's influence himself. the last few pages of the manuscript are just unintelligible drunken scribbles.
or maybe you'd rather try this? i know, i know -- i normally can't bring myself to drink sake this expensive either.
food like ramen and hotpot tend to have a lot of oil and salt, so i don't get to eat them very often.
hehe... regardless, please do look after me while i'm visiting this lovely little teapot of yours.
yes, to some degree. but, lady vennessa... and master jean... they worked much harder than me.
after ei created her puppet vessel, she no longer had anywhere to put it.
just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend -- people of all kinds that carried the will of the aeons.
the entire crew has agreed to assist in the reconstruction of penacony. beyond that, in our future travels, we are committed to bringing the beautiful dreams of the planet of festivities to more worlds.
it symbolizes a chance to introduce ourselves to the cosmos once again -- a heroic kingdom that survived both the legion and the eternal freeze with tenacity.
actually, now that you mention it, i'm suddenly a little hungry. huh. amidst the thrill of the chase, i didn't even notice.
hehe, wangsheng funeral parlor should keep up with the times! just think about it! if we don't attract new clients, we'll be left with nothing, won't we?
yes, you're absolutely right. this is what i appreciate about you, you see things the way they are rather than how they appear.
that red-haired contestant... who is that exactly?
that's kujou sara, adopted daughter of the kujou clan of the tenryou commission. she's also a general in the shogun's army. what's she doing here...?
we'll do our best. if we can't find one, we'll just do what your guide says and chop wood to make a fire.
it may seem like the stellaron hunters are controlling everything, but we create our own future. no matter how powerful they are, they can't make a future that doesn't exist come true.
so tell me, how do you plan to respond to the fontainian musician? it sounded to me like his music was commenting on the war...
beidou is salvaging some of my jade chamber collection out of the sea around guyun stone forest. if that sounds like your idea of fun, you should go pay her a visit.
it turns out that there is still another piece to the story of kamai and the samurai that you are missing.
it appears your martial prowess has not dulled.
hm... it's a place too cold to bear, covered in snow and ice. the guys doing the scientific research don't have time to worry about the surroundings.
but you cannot put mora above all else. you cannot go exploiting children for profit. do you have any idea just how much damage that will cause?
i know you've been on the road for a long time and cold drinks would be bad for your stomach.
please wait, onodera. there might be yet another solution.
hmph, i don't want people to see me that way... i'm doing this for you. otherwise, i wouldn't be using my brother's name.
*sigh* the first time we met madam yukong she said something like: "this is a xianzhou affair and there's no need for the express to get involved..."
if you find out anything interesting, you gotta come back and tell me about it!
it looks like the general's arrangements are finally coming in handy... i need to find yunli and the others as soon as possible.
you've been standing here for half an hour. it's rare to see you like this.
never mind. just don't look so lost when we're in class later, or you might just sleep yourself to dreamflux reef.
nevertheless, when it comes to things like ghosts and ghouls, spirits and souls, the one thing everyone knows is you never know what to expect...
yes, everyone attending the auction today is in possession of lost property belonging to me.
what...? hey, you can't just make up "titles" like that!
but now, i no longer cling to what was lost. i suppose that means our differences have been reconciled.
...but, the gate didn't move an inch...
uhh... nothing, actually.
...i think i have figured out what those stars are hiding.
just wait until you're a bit older, hook -- then you can go wherever you want~
i think i understand.
o--okay, we trust you~!
i suppose... pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
it was with those funds that belobog was able to construct its immense walls... even the initial funding for the development of the first batch of automatons was drawn from the same pool.
the mountains of that age were replaced by the vast stretch of ocean we see today. still, a mountain that high? drop it into the ocean and it'll still leave a trace.
the truth is... we are on the same side.
alright! here comes, the jarilo-vi trailblaze team!
if we want to progress further north, we will need to cross that hell. are you ready?
all i know is that despite being custom-made, they are not particularly exquisite -- if they were, you can be sure i would have purchased one sooner.
huh? are you all together, then?
the second step is to focus all your anxiety on that point.
i'm the one who should be sorry -- i was being too pushy! you're right, you went through a lot on the xianzhou -- take all the time you need...
ah... i wish we could have spent some more time here.
i quickly learned that every card back with that particular design had been scooped up overnight. there's not a single one left in all of liyue.
...so aggressive. are all the robots in the settlement like this?
something must have happened when i was frozen in the ice. i bet the memories were freezing and decided to hibernate.
is that the owner's name? sounds a bit familiar...
(hey! that's not the right thing to say... you managed to stir up this guy's sense of pride)
you must be tired after the walk back to shore. perhaps i should let you go first?
have you seen qiqi? tell me where she is, quickly. i need to go seal her away, hee-hee!
yup! i always dreamed of a head-scratcher like this -- a chance to showcase my detective genius.
...but how did you accomplish this in a single night?
the way i see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection...
master yunli has a very freestyle approach to teaching. the thing she always says to me is: "you just feel it!" maybe that's what they call experiential guidance?
we have cleared out the enemies in starskiff haven.
actually, i'm not surprised in the slightest. remember what i said? there's only so many evil spirits in this world.
uh-huh, that's my pops! he's a good person, alright. everyone around here respects him.
oh, while you're here -- have either of you seen qiqi around?
satoru is on the other side of the village, let's go see him now.
...yes, it's a possibility. that would explain why my memory of it is so blurry.
for now, i do not think this invite is linked to the watchmaker. his legacy... it sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.
so if my intention is different, it can have a big effect on the outcome...
it'll be fine. it's actually like this every year, there's always a bunch of extra orders to slot in here and there.
hey... thanks for your concern. you should head back to the town, and... i'll do the same when oleg and i are finished.
that's right. i wish for peace and happiness for everyone in inazuma, and good health for my family and friends.
if it were me seeking help from someone in a time of crisis, i'd sure hope they showed up in person...
but now that we're on this track, i think we'll find it easy!
hmm, perhaps... although, maybe it would be easier if there were a few more customers?
the universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends... even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. that's the beauty of the unknown.
it's my pleasure. no need to be formal -- just speak your mind. you said "with little time left"... please forgive me for being blunt, but is that why you came to penacony?
you see, there's not much left for me here except to carry on repairing equipment in the workshop... i like practicing the guitar, and performances are fun, but the crowds are pretty small.
sorry for dragging you with me everywhere... everyone's been so good to me though. it's all gone really smoothly, hee-hee.
true. that's one reason why it's been difficult to catch on.
having a dojo in one's home is akin to placing one's sword on the table. it is a reminder to never be negligent.
did you now? well then, you'll have to tell me all about it.
is... this the guide?
are you implying... that the same goes for humans too?
these days, we don't deal with the wrath of the gods anymore, but all the relevant know-how is still passed down to each generation. so we can identify gods' remains when we see them.
totally used to it~ pela and i have already struck fear into the hearts of more than a few newbies.
i expected no less of you, my friend. i gladly accept my defeat!
hee-hee, i was particularly proud of this batch, i decided to--
during that time, all children of the appropriate age in both the overworld and the underworld will be tested. in the end, only one child deemed as "worthy" will be chosen.
you asked me what fireworks mean to me, right?
but the thought of becoming a knight just like her in every way... i could never achieve that.
...you'd better not snitch on me, okay?
in the animation, he's hanu's partner and one of the founders of dreamville. does that mean the watchmaker was personally involved in that war and sided with asdana?
however, the same applies to the order. their plan didn't materialize overnight, and they have the profound collective consciousness of the planet of festivities behind them...
let me repeat -- all i received were the supreme guardian's instructions. it is for the adjudication panel to pass judgment on the accused.
true... but we came here to trailblaze, not jailblaze.
still, i suppose i should keep on helping everyone, i am the epitome of "joy, kindness, and goodness," after all.
anyway, so i will be sticking around here for now to keep a close eye on the situation. maybe tomorrow, i'll finally figure out what he's up to...
i was wondering the same thing. why would they pick on someone half their size?
i'd like to know too, because i was already on the express when i woke up.
when people want fireworks, it's always because they have something to commemorate. and if they miss the chance, they might never get another one. so, no matter how busy i am, i'm always happy to take their orders.
be at ease, i'm not here to see commissioner kamisato. actually, i'd prefer to spend this time chatting with the traveler. please, fetch the tea set at your convenience.
i was worried that i might not be up to the task, so i wanted to write to you and ask for your advice at that time.
well, i thought since pom-pom can't leave the express, bringing a doll with us is kind of like taking them trailblazing.
it turned out that they delivered the goods and thoroughly enjoyed themselves while they were at it. so, it was a win-win.
what's wrong? you look so serious all of a sudden.
i'm sorry. i wasn't there for the whole thing. by the time i arrived, the worst of the fighting was already over.
wow, you really got under skott's skin with just a few words.
you're definitely a unique individual, just like huaiyan said.
indeed. countless monsters suddenly appeared throughout all of inazuma. in the end... kitsune saiguu sacrificed her life to protect the people.
no matter how perfect your vision of paradise may be, a cage remains a cage.
a familiar flavor... acceptable.
his lifelong dream was to reach the summit of a mountain called pilos peak.
this time, we're not being forced or enticed, or chasing after wanted criminals. and we didn't have to sneak in through the cargo dock. this trip has been incredibly smooth...
take a good look at your pocket. your friend has already given you the answer.
i hope that by the end of this journey... everyone will have achieved the outcome that they hoped for.
believe it or not, galaxy ranger, acheron... those are the names i go by to this very day. my trip to penacony is solely to fulfill an old "final request".
the hero's down and out, defeat hangin' in the air, but in walks the master with wisdom to share--
nice! you found footage of him leaving?
don't worry, i'll make you some fireworks that you'll never forget!
mister giovanni is right! now's our chance to check out this game and see if it lives up to the hype.
the alchemy commission detained me for some time for a health examination. they released me only after ensuring i was in good condition.
that sounds... like a good idea, no? this way, the adventurers won't get hurt so easily.
lynxy? ...she's more like me. ah, don't tell my brother that, he hates hearing it.
oh? you arrived a little later than expected. did you run into some trouble along the way?
she no longer needs the power of the gnosis, and in any case, she tells me she has severed ties with celestia.
did we miss anyone in the overworld? i think we asked just about everyone we needed to.
you are a very lucky person, you know. you get to sit in on this lunch for free.
next, i'll be introducing the history of the museum. everyone, listen carefully, okay?
so reckless... according to the rules of the silvermane guards, any expedition into the fragmentum must have a squad of at least four members, as well as a communications officer.
uh, eh-he... this interpretation is sounding a little odd... do we have any other evidence?
what do you say? ready to call it a day?
the folks from the yashiro commission specifically warned me that no fireworks are allowed in inazuma during the irodori festival.
all i did was bring the people of belobog together and make them aware that our hard-earned freedom was under immense threat once again.
not only that, dodoco is also real. look!
i didn't find any components, but i got this... i don't know if we can still eat it...
...uh, but what i really wanted to say was: don't worry about me, it'll all be fine!
all thanks to your guidance while we were out on our inspiration walk.
all very true. an original core concept, a fast pace, quality illustrations, and lots of action. this is the formula that will guarantee good sales numbers.
ugh, you two again!? we're minding our own business -- you're the ones going around stealing people's aether spirits!
fine, well if you're dead-set on doing something for me, you can treat me to a meal.
yeah... surely we've earned it?
come on, baizhu, don't tell me you haven't noticed it? didn't your master teach you how to spot the signs?
the rules still stand. these little ones won the tournament and passed the ultimate trial, which means they'll be taking elchingen and kautilya's place.
hmm... two, three, one, four... luocha emerges from the inn, goes to spare time book shop, turns into an alley, then appears at the dock with his luggage...
ugh... in the eyes of most people, there's a world of difference between "trivial matters" and a career.
oh, uh, that's not the issue...
no need to beat around the bush, sir.
why would someone from such a wealthy family do something like this for money... it's unbelievable! we have to find a way to stop this before they sell the film!
the present situation is... we're here! this planet isn't doomed after all...
hey? aren't we supposed to kick off a short story and have a fight here just like we did in the previous acts? why aren't any of these puppets saying anything?
i had an opportunity to feast with him once, back when i was just a kagemusha attending a gathering of the gods. so he's made his choice. be that as it may, i don't believe his story is anywhere near finished yet.
if i can't learn swordplay well, i'll have no one to blame but myself.
xinyan, what was your wish?
ah, no need to worry, dan heng's rarely late. i'm sure he must have a good reason...
i'm inclined to agree... it's hard to imagine she wrote that letter just to deceive me.
rest assured, cocolia may have changed over the years... but she'd never hurt bronya. i'm certain of that.
of course i do. it's not like the stuff we need is gonna come crawling out.
oh, well that's good to hear. i gotta say, it's pretty remarkable that the citizens managed to step up and keep things going even after their archon left.
wow, this market is even busier than the one in port ormos.
she's not in a hurry, that's for sure. playing hide-and-seek with us while kafka's still at large.
...really? feels like you're tricking me...
looks like we're just one step from revealing the truth. let's get to the other side and investigate.
ahem! yae miko said nothing of the sort, and the traveler has some nerve making up spurious claims about her while she is still present.
hahaha, close enough... she was a little downcast. i think it has something to do with the mirage we saw today.
actually, seeing as there's no one around... can i ask you some things?
foolish question. there are only two kinds of things -- those that must be done and those that must not.
even if that star... must hang in a perpetual night of solitude?
since you can see it, that means you've found what you've lost.
i declare you my chamberlain. in other words, according to my judgment, you are useful to the shogunate and loyal to me.
not bad. i suppose this is a step forward for you. but i'm afraid...
i have invited you two here as friends. and when friends come over to play, our enjoyment comes first, naturally.
well, well, someone's feeling pretty confident...
about time i got some credit for it!
...watch out! a dangerous presence lurks nearby.
yeah! i'll show skott the power of the xianzhou swordplay that he despises!
in the meantime, i'll follow up on the exhibit theft case. i wonder if any new clues were found over in svarog's domain...
you guys are travelers, right? so, where else did you go before coming to inazuma?
sure, is there something you wanted to ask me?
so i promise you that should you one day require financial assistance, you may seek employment here. i will pay you at the highest rate of remuneration.
...i'm fine. i just... feel a little faint.
just pop a thermic core into a lamp, and all the nearby lamps will light up simultaneously -- cool, right?
no, there's no need! i don't want to see sebas right now. sorry, mother...
i have a knack for blending different coffee beans. can i make you a cup? i recommend not adding milk -- black coffee is proper coffee.
their flimsy disguise has been exposed. even if they try to hide, there's no way they can escape us.
i brought gallagher here. it's time... to face the "truth."
hee-hee, seems like i've finally got a new job to do! ...y'know, besides hiding vision bearers in my shop, that is...
finds like this cannot be kept as private property, and must be submitted to a holder of public office. placing it into our custody will also give them peace of mind.
that box is really important to me...
sumeru... i've heard of it. it has a ton of trees, a super impressive school, and a massive desert!
oh? sounds like it's victory meal time! count me in!
...alright. i guess we'll just have to trust you... for now.
the vision hunt decree has my tacit approval.
oh, not exactly. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
we can't leave her alone! i'll meet up with you later. this isn't me running away from a fight, okay?
no need. "she" is calling me. the time has come.
incredible... this is really a sight that can only be witnessed in a dream...
then, why would you feel the need to set up an inn here?
wow, what a beautiful lobby! it's gonna be soft mattresses and cushiony pillows tonight!
come on. let's keep investigating the damage to the sacred sakura.
i know! he must have found a treasure map at spare time book shop. he went into the alley to dig it up and then went home with his newfound riches!
i hope this isn't a disrespectful thing to say, but... i never knew my mother was so in touch with her inner child, haha.
hmm let's see... what else is there to like? well, of course it's... it's... guess!
yes... i haven't passed the selection trials yet, but i've been asking senior knights for advice on how to become a true knight of favonius.
i can't believe fragmentum corrosion has spread into the city... no wonder there are so many soldiers stationed there.
hold on, traveler. there's something else we need to discuss.
you made it sound like you were talking to those kids... but you were talking to me.
i'm just here to try something new. there's no fun in reading the same kind of thing over and over again. relax, it's just words on a page, isn't it? what could i misunderstand, really?
haha, herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. i'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
nice to meet you, collei. i missed you the last few times you were in mondstadt, so i'm glad to finally meet you in person.
...this way, we'll at least know what welt and miss robin are dealing with, and the reason why they failed to make our appointment.
why do we have to lie? ...i'm abstaining -- i like telling the truth. but... i get what you're trying to do.
hmph! i have to see the ending.
yes, let's. our answer is:
i've probably got a thirty% chance, or less.
isn't that the name of fontaine's hydro archon? my brother has already informed me about what happened here in fontaine.
we are indebted to you for your assistance. if the adepti hadn't happened to be here, the future of liyue harbor would surely have been in great jeopardy...
*sigh* i guess i don't have any other choice. i'll rent this place.
there's also a unique spicy taste, like a warm current spreading through my mouth. awesome!
all those things, beautiful before, are still so now. and i believe...
it's just that i've failed several times in the past... i still don't know if i can make it this time...
whenever i praise her, she does her utmost to keep a straight face and hide any trace of happiness she might be feeling... i can tell, because i've practiced the same thing.
a place where time is meaningless and cannot be understood with ordinary logic... so, that was the "turbulence" i was sensing.
resorting to sorcery to turn ninjas into fiendlings... dreadfully horrid.
at one point, there were a dozen or so kids born around the same time to the families of the guild. they all grew up together, each of them learning their respective family's business.
how's that? give me your thoughts.
there's no need for hesitation, ninja hiryu. if there's an ambush, we foil the ambush. if there's a scheme, we thwart the scheme.
i'm not talking about the puppet. i mean... her. you've met her, yes?
and if i end up having to do it all over again in the future... i will not hesitate to make the same decision again.
why did she go to khaenri'ah first, and not i? why did she keep me in the dark about it? was it to shield me?
look who we have here? a lovely young lady.
it'll be fine -- we have other people in the underworld working on the investigation too. besides, we don't have any clues yet, so we may as well do something useful.
and you don't even have to join us in person if you really don't want to. you can just watch the party from a nearby mountaintop and cheer us on.
i can see it in your faces. you both have so much to say... and you're just gonna choose to keep it all inside?
but gradually, they stopped seeing me as someone to be afraid of, and started seeing me as someone they can trust.
of course we wanna help... we care about other people too y'know.
come on... stop joking at a moment like this. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
you are the enemy of eternity...
*sigh* you're right. since we're already here...
i know that they don't really exist, but i still enjoy believing in them. if someone came up to me and starting telling me to "stop being so stupid, they don't exist, nyah nyah nyah"...
i'm the complete march seventh... with all of your forgotten memories.
reserved? really?
the monkey that scurried past you was once a sailor. he knew how to ferment his own wine, and would do so regularly.
hmm. narrative devices are truly mysterious things.
the original mikawa flower festival was much more lively. but even if you could attend the original, you probably wouldn't be as happy as you are now.
could you tell us more about your grandpa mikhail?
i knew you had to be talking about slumbernana monkey.
the issue is this... for the vast majority of people, the vision hunt decree is something that has no implications whatsoever.
thank goodness we got here in time. if we'd arrived any later...
this is the final scene -- it's much more straightforward... he wants to expel the harmony and establish an empire based on the order.
paimon, you're so adorable that you could wear anything and it would look lovely on you.
jiangzhou was responsible for planning the lantern rite in former years, but her father is getting quite old now, so she transferred to another department this year.
now that you mention it... yes. we're being watched.
i am just a warrior, so my pledge to you is simple...
be careful. don't get fooled by her again.
mm, it really looks the part... i'm quite impressed.
come on. don't crack jokes at such a serious moment.
then the ipc isn't your family! stop lying to yourself.
if we can help, don't hesitate to ask. i don't know much about medicine, but... there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
this i really wasn't expecting...
hehe, that settles it, then. now, there are already a few visitors at the shrine. make sure you take good care of them.
that way, even if the front line were to collapse... the fragmentum monsters wouldn't be able to make it to the other side.
it's fine. those of us here are all trustworthy, so there isn't any harm in it.
you had the audacity to tell your men to disguise themselves as silvermane guards... i'll be interested to see what kind of sentence the adjudication panel gives you.
whatever he was planning to do... he was heading straight for you.
the signal broke off, seems that's all there is.
yum... whew, i'm so full, not another bite!
this is not "the strong defending the weak", but rather "the strong exploiting the weak". a world without equality won't ever be favored by the harmony, and naturally, those voices blessed by them... have lost the ability to sing.
then tell me, which of the ipc's achievements can you personally take credit for?
vanquishing general? isn't that title a bit too narcissistic? i don't like it.
greetings. i'm acheron.
but she doesn't seem to be able to move or talk...
you may not have heard, friends, but--
*sigh* you're in a museum, remember!? here, let me explain - this exhibit was recently stolen.
when all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved inazuma, forever and ever. isn't that right?
to help everyone really cut loose and enjoy themselves to the fullest, venti and i have carefully prepared three themes, to be revealed over the course of three days!
the name's serval. i'm, uh... an ex-engineer from the technology division and... gepard's sister. pleasure to meet you, chief!
because as far as most people are concerned, mora is the key to any and all opportunities.
huh? it's you... you were there at the fort...
oh, all right. you stay safe.
general, did you... hear about miss tingyun...?
purified filth quickly dissipates and will be absorbed by the ley lines shortly afterwards. in other words, it cannot exist for too long.
is this what it means... to reminisce?
something has come up, and i would like to request your assistance.
let us gift our applause and cheers to these brave and dauntless nameless!
it is my honor. i've said many goodbyes. yet i am glad, that this is the first time i speak those words with a smile.
most people only pay attention to your tail, but those soft, pointy ears are really just as fascinating.
we sold some fireworks to liyue a while back, and word is they were a real hit. so it looks like we'll be getting more business from over there in the future.
ninja hero? huh, it seems that my trial has finally come to an end...
in short, if everything goes according to plan, they may yet prove to be helpful.
i heard from master jean that there was a hilichurl camp nearby, that often attacks traveling merchants.
but... we still don't have any weapons in hand...
what's wrong, gepard? ahh, i see... can't let go of your dear ol' sister, eh?
i really enjoy staring out into the universe. what a vast, mesmerizing, romantic view.
not so. only everything that pertains to eternity.
so many thoughts were racing through my head as i was brewing it, i... i'm not sure how to explain it...
ha. whatever the case, you've got everything to gain from this trip.
ahem... mister payne, please eat this... it will make you feel better...
erosion is a terrible thing. this body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve eternity.
channeling all my skill and style, with a flick of the wrist i released the dice from my hands, and shouted my battle cry at the top of my lungs!
when you heard that... did it make you think that maybe i really was a cynical profit-chaser after all?
t--this... so this book, this diary... is that hag's... it's her diary from fifty years ago!?
still... good thing the hilichurls we encountered weren't too fierce. thankfully, i was able to handle them.
calm down, no need to panic. that's not why we're here.
hmph, i should've known you'd listen to that stellaron hunter. whatever -- but you should think before you do that.
so, arnold, let me ask you something...
that's why the shogun has a robust system to safeguard against modification. it's also to protect against unforeseen circumstances.
no, you can drink that in belobog as well.
i don't think this, and never have. nor do you.
so, did you find anything at dreamflux reef?
this time, i will be fulfilling the role of the archon's emissary.
this is a young person's adventure, we shouldn't interfere. at most, we could offer a little "off-site assistance."
as in, the little thing that looks something like a chess piece?
i was just taking a look at mister yang's records, and it seems that jarilo-vi's average temperature has warmed up quite a bit. it's much warmer than it was on our first trip there.
no saving allowed! let's keep it relevant: this time's for now, next time's for later. no ious on praise!
to ensure the text lasted longer, they'd either write using a special ink or coat the paper's surface with a waterproof coating once the writing was finished.
still, i'm happy to see that you approve of my culinary tastes.
ha! shocking? i guess you're still new -- you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later...
divination is about precisely foretelling one's written destiny. over-embellishing that fate only leads to misconception.
i thought it would turn out poorly because i felt rather rigid. but it actually looks much more natural than i'd imagined.
*sigh* haha, there i go talking about astrological principles again. sorry about that, the moment i start talking about work-related stuff... oh, i need to get going!
hmm... out of a maximum of ten points, i'd give that a nine!
...but then wait, where does bullying the owner of the sleepless earl fit in with all of this?
right? i'm glad belobog has someone like her in charge...
huh? what are you expecting me to do here...?
are you not the same, blade? the end you desire is not one dictated by others.
what happened? is there something i can help you with?
i believe that one day, at some stop on the trailblaze, we will meet again.
that was when i saw you. you didn't have a human form at the time, and possessed only the earliest traces of sentience.
the most terrible form? does that mean...?
this norbert guy, do you know what his line of work was?
the moon is simply magnificent tonight. we mustn't squander it. come, join me for a moonlight stroll -- i won't take no for an answer.
oh yeah, um, this is some pickled radish from misess imatani.
but in the end, they became objects of merchants' greed.
alright. let's get to it!
if we landaus have one thing in common, it's that we're all stubborn in our own way.
i saw an intellitron there who was preparing to auction himself. when someone wins a bid, under stipulated periods and rules, he would do the buyer's every bidding, becoming that person's very possession.
sorry about this -- ever since pops had his accident, his ears don't work too well.
i constantly remind myself: if i want to have a perfect performance, i have to let the audience feel the emotions and story of the song as well.
this area isn't for receiving guests, it's for unloading cargo! who decided to send us this way?
okay, i think we have a few potential suspects.
hehe, a typical move by lady yae. it works out well for everybody, doesn't it?
there are people born impoverished who don't know what hope is. there are also people born broken who do not know what it's like to be whole...
be at ease, you two. make yourselves at home if you wish.
you should stay here, little layla. i understand that you want to help haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. leave it to them this time.
wow, that was fast... don't you have anything you wanna bring with you?
with the cerulean sky and chirping birds accompanying you today, i am certain you will have a pleasant journey.
if this is our escort, it's less friendly than i was expecting.
oh? that voice... is that who i think it is?
sure enough, you're at the center of the action once again. you two truly are like the main characters in your own light novel.
something's awry. i believe i should've held back in the ninja battle just now... perhaps someone is controlling these fiendlings behind the scenes?
oh, i'm so excited that i don't even know what i should be doing anymore!
captain gepard...? i think he could accurately be described as belobog's iron wall. in this city, it's more difficult to defend than go on the offensive.
after all, this is our honorary knight, the one who defended mondstadt from the claws of the frenzied stormterror.
they were different from most... but their passing came so suddenly that it was thought they were killed by another aeon. i don't believe that to be the case.
uh-huh! i... let's just leave it here for a while... and it'll be alright, right?
a cloud of mystery shrouds the aeons. i heard madam herta recruited a team to try and solve the mysteries about them.
i must apologize... to be perfectly honest, i thought the cakes would be a tasty addition.
well then. i look forward to both of your contributions.
just like everyone in this story, hurtling onwards along the path of destiny with passion and courage, for the things that breathe meaning into their lives.
thank you for your kind words, director furina. unfortunately... there are still many matters that i have to take care of back home at the yashiro commission. i cannot remain in fontaine to pursue an acting career.
well, sure, there's that... but that's not exactly what i meant.
so... i can defeat him just like that?
you've... met her, right?
going out at unusual hours, the shopping street, could it be...
oh, how cold. i saved your skin, didn't i? surely you could at least humor me by engaging in some small talk first?
...i told you, gepard, the barrier hasn't been fixed yet! don't try and be a hero!
yes. i don't know whether it was the sages or lesser lord kusanali who came up with the idea.
in life, youkai possess supernatural powers, and even when they are a shadow of their former selves from a bygone era, they still have the ability to control whether they are visible or not.
i heard that a lot of the knights of favonius have been playing genius invokation tcg. i want to try, too...
what do you think? be honest. i just want to know your first impression.
huh? so you're saying everything went back to normal once you smashed this thing to pieces?
...would you mind if i made a trip to the astral express one time, just to listen to music?
well hello there, little one. oh? i see you've brought a special guest.
you see what i mean? look at the state of him. if we can't find big g, it'll eat away at meng forever.
then... we'll keep it for now...
i can't make another one, but i'm guessing sakujirou probably won't be needing his anymore... it'd be a shame for it to go to waste, so i'll make an exception and let you set it off instead.
without the sacred sakura, inazuma would likely have been completely swallowed up centuries ago by that disaster and the filth.
in their eyes, we're mere consumables, cannon fodder used to slow down xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
got it, seele. we'll do what we can to help bronya out.
*sigh* i knew we'd spent too long around the master diviner -- now we're predicting the future...
if running the store gets a bit too much, take some time off and wait for me to return.
are you forgetting we've got mister yang with us? oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet...
yes. i think you'll understand the significance once you see it... in short, i need you to help us evaluate our current progress.
during the festival, most of the yae publishing house's editors will be staying near the outlander affairs agency. if you run into any problems, you may find them there.
in her arms she was carrying a little fox on the brink of death. she knelt before kitsune saiguu and begged her to save her friend.
if clockie really exists, that can explain a lot of things.
this is my duty. no matter how long this battle may last, months, years, centuries... and no matter how many times we must fight, i will defeat her.
and thus... i became the daughter of madam cocolia. my only identity is that of guardian successor, but i'm... not good enough...
let's walk while we eat. it's time to head to the next stop!
like madam herta? hmmm, that would make sense. anyway, it's really weird for a xianzhou native to look so old.
hehe, well you are in the dreamscape, after all.
my astrology is based on hydromancy, and as the name suggests, i use the reflections in water bodies to observe the true starry sky.
...but still, i appreciate your help. i mean it from the bottom of my heart.
that... captain. she clearly receives the adoration of many, but will always be the first to disregard the rules. the fines she has paid would be enough to buy her a whole new ship...
it will bear the name "firefly" and the brilliance she showed at the end of her life.
are you sure? this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. i'd urge you not to squander it.
yeah. miss himeko said that they were investigating the incidents happening in the dreamscape.
how bizarre... there are still signs of the camp, and the machine is still here, but all the people have vanished.
for the sake of the vision hunt decree, of course. don't you think the shogun might reconsider her policy if all of the things you just mentioned appeared in this report?
foolish question. there are only two kinds of foods -- those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.
hehe, that seems rather fitting, considering that we are dealing with the spirits of the deceased here.
it'd most certainly be a wonderfully momentous occasion...
oops. i got so excited that i completely forgot about that.
that was the main reason, yes. just a while back, the steambird invited me to take part in a panel and speak about the circulation of the prophecy as an astrologist.
whoa... i felt like i suddenly lost weight when we passed through.
we must pursue that primordial light.
humans traverse the path of fate... seeking knowledge, craving revelation, striving to exist...
...he looks like a skilled fighter, the covert kind. he has large palms, yet his fingers are slender and nimble. i reckon he has experience using knives, like a short sword or dagger...
the murky mirror reflects the view of inazuma in a bygone age. spirits stirred by the sight of the past will be easily drawn to it.
...hey, slow down! we still have questions that need answering!
knight of favonius? oh... i--i'm not...
things just got serious. "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" is an all-round hit, summarily beating the novels of the yae publishing house by every analysis.
master jean is a pillar of the knights of favonius and a great source of inspiration to me... if i could gain even one or two of her qualities, i would be very happy.
it's really beautiful, isn't it?
honestly, i didn't think we'd get it back so easily... it almost feels like something's not quite right.
that's enough chatting for now. i'll leave blitzara in your hands. remember to take good care of it.
you bet! the express can vouch for bronya. that says a lot about her character.
yes, i'd say so. everything starts out small, you focus on quantity at the outset, and gradually shift to focusing on quality as your wealth builds.
but if the going gets too tough for you... well, i shall lend a hand then.
anyway, we're finally done with the admission process. let's go check out the anniversary. how about we start with the creator's market that montana mentioned?
don't worry, i have another way to deal with this if no one can find anything... it's just a little wasteful to use it on something like this. but we can't let it continue to stress the conductor either.
...the "super electromagnetic flux player," or "electric guitar" for short.
according to my grandpa, he and my great-uncle once went traveling together when they were young. they ended up at chenyu vale, where they met a pharmacist.
i really did jinx us! i don't think i have it in me to play the hero today!
the shadow seems to have returned to fischl's heart, where it belongs.
traveler, you are quite close to keqing, why don't you try talking to her? maybe she'd listen to someone as experienced as you.
our first encounter may have been a bit of a disaster, but it was also the start of a new future... haha, if seele heard this she'd probably say i was giving one of my overworld princess speeches.
um... miss himeko, sorry for interrupting, but this doesn't sound like a negotiation...
don't worry. we'll have plenty of time to spend together on the express, so there'll definitely be more chances for adventures like this.
is that it? we've reached the elevator already? that wasn't too many monsters~
the xianzhou alliance... i've heard of them, but never had any contact with them.
oh, you don't mind, do you, mister amenoma! as you know, it's not long now until the naganohara fireworks show starts.
not all foxians are lucky enough to be born on a xianzhou ship... i grew up in one of the worlds where borisin roam, known as the "fallen territories" by the people of the yaoqing.
not with that attitude! you could, uh... knit sweaters with "rock 'n' roll" in big letters! then get everyone to wear them!
you're awake. i had march and dan heng stay by the express to keep an eye on things.
items purchased in the dreamscape can also be brought into reality through an extra service. unfortunately, the transfer of automobiles to the real world is not available at the moment... you can come back for them next time.
correct. please do all you can to help them. i will await your return here.
she seems... very nervous.
in the future, a terrible catastrophe will arrive. if, under qlipoth the preservation's guidance, we fail to construct a barrier, that catastrophe will sweep away the stars, plunging all worlds into hell.
we're not entirely sure... he said something about "adding an element of mystery to the story."
but... i know you're going to say "but," right?
i also thought to tell him how the past generations of qixing had strove under his rule to survive in our mortal world, establishing a network of contracts which has since come to be known as "trade."
i get really bored when no one's talking to me. when we're on the express, himeko and mister yang are pretty busy, but dan heng's usually free. he doesn't like chatting though...
wh--why'd you just shout that out? it's embarrassing...
the master's wisdom resonates to his core, the hero's blade sharper than ever before. yesterday's loser is back in the fight, fight or flight, evildoers think twice.
they say kids grow up really fast. yanqing, are you a little bit taller than before?
perhaps we'll need to "complete" the story ourselves just like we did before.
...huh? you just said you didn't wanna complicate things for me, and now you're sending me on a mission...
he probably is... hopefully, we don't bump into him, but if we do, we'll just have to try and talk to him...
come with me, let us find shelter from the rain.
perhaps... perhaps i've been holding on to everything too tightly.
really? hearing you say that makes me want to spar with you all of a sudden.
...i still don't think i can do what master jean does... but at least i could start by trying to be gentle like her.
i hope you'll walk alongside the reignbow's path as a friend.
wait! wasn't there some big energy hub-looking thing back in that empty area? let's go back and take a look, maybe it's linked to this gate.
it's a strong opening -- an easy way to grab the readers' attention. never underestimate the appeal of culinary-oriented subject matter. food, after all, is a topic that everyone is interested in.
...i'd probably choose to ask the bloodhounds to cease their pursuit.
quietly watching something you made with your own hands rise into the sky, it feels like a sacred ceremony to me.
you guys figure it out for yourselves. i'm due to catch up with an old war friend i've not seen for quite a long time.
but it seems... in the land of the dreams, anything is indeed possible.
thank goodness the general didn't make us go with the knights... fighting is totally different from adventuring. all these people... i--it's tough to bear.
looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. and he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
and good news too?
hehe, don't worry. if he wants an exorcism, just grab a handful of salt and mutter some mumbo-jumbo while you're sprinkling it around.
only a very few people in belobog know of the existence of the stellaron. those that do would never associate it with the fragmentum or eternal freeze.
huh? are you talking to us?
as her erstwhile closest friend... ei handed it over to me, and i've kept it in the grand narukami shrine ever since.
...a "guardian of humanity" that can... command robots? i've never heard of anything like...
yes... even though i failed to imitate captain kaeya...
okay, there's no queue in the lobby now. let's go find miss alley...
oh, yes, the stew and cold cuts your mother made were heavenly! mmm, i could go for some more of that right now...
and i see you've brought some... friends? clients? business partners? new associates?
wait, wait! master diviner, can you divine our fortunes for us? is there anything we need to watch out for?
the "script" hasn't reached its end yet -- we will meet again!
k--keep watch? are we space cowboys now? i guess this is the cosmic wild west.
is that a secret code or something?
it's a common trope in light novels, right? you just have to have a bit of bravado. as soon as the protagonist gains self-confidence, everything else just magically falls into place.
no ritual at all. we just need to kill some time.
as i mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." still, look at it this way: just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
ugh! where did he run off to -- he was just here a second ago!
yes-- i mean, no! you really have no way with words.
uh... it's really all just cleaning and tidying...
the result being that in the centuries since their sacrifice, i have dishonored their will.
where's our next stop? we should find somewhere to put our feet up, as long as it's not goethe hotel again...
you've got a lot of nerve drawing your weapons in front of an intelligence officer of the silvermane guards!
the building site has been chosen, and most of the materials have been assembled. three key items are, however, still outstanding.
at that time, i could sense ei's whereabouts, but i also sensed anomalies in the flow of time within that space.
unfortunately, dan shu is dead, and even her corpse has crumbled into ash. that's one less clue we can pursue.
as you can see, this sculpture was placed at the entrance of the industrial hall because it symbolizes the industrial spirit that belobogians have lived, breathed and produced for centuries.
i can't say i blame you -- we're nothing alike in personality or interests.
if you liken human lives to light novels, every one has its highlights, but also inevitably has many aspects that are similar to all the others.
that's wonderful-- wait a moment... w--why isn't it locked!? and... why is it empty!?
*sigh* don't worry, i won't dig too deep. i know bronya must have thought long and hard before deciding what to make public.
even though she will one day... seize your vision, too?
sounds like the association really cares about their players.
how do i put this... you're no match for her at all.
it's too early to start fieldwork -- we must wait until my deduction is complete. then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a t!
it's all true, though. i just... don't have very many friends.
allow me to point out that falling into a permanent slumber is not happiness, especially when those people are driven by someone else's will in their sleep.
with a true heart and focused mind -- here i come!
i would ask: would you still embark on this journey?
need someone to talk to, hmm? aw, what's the matter, are you feeling lonely?
ah, he used that "tuning" on us, too! does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?
oh, an active stellaron is rarely a cause for celebration... what did herta say about the fragmentum's appearance?
hmm... i don't know how to deal with people like that.
no, no... i just want to take an exam for the experience...
the next time we have an important policy decision on our hands, i'd like you to get involved.
it has to be nearby! let me go take a peek with my sharp eyes.
but for now, i have to stay home with my pops, so i won't be traveling far anytime soon.
just my luck... out of all the research topics i could've chosen, i insisted on the stellaron. it's clear now that anyone who wanted to get closer to the truth would have been expelled or "abandoned."
of course. that is exactly why i'm here. but before that--
i knew you would keep your promise, after all... i'm sure you've barely been able to take your mind off it these past few days -- have you managed to get any sleep at all?
anyway, let's wait a bit more and get ready for the show. this ley line monolith will make for a really great prop.
hey, that's not your line! we're here to take a photo, remember?
but... you'll have to promise me one thing: you'll never steal other people's things again. promise?
everyone, as the charmony festival is drawing closer, we must reach the end as quickly as possible... factoring in efficiency and safety, splitting up into two groups is the best choice.
*sigh* please stop bringing that up. let's just say that landings and crowds don't mix.
don't you realize how special you are? remember, the plane of euthymia is a space where only she is allowed to exist. the fact that you could appear there tells us one crucial thing:
i trust my intuition more than any words.
i see... you've also had a similar experience? then you should know that this me and your memory of me are not the same person.
really? hmm, i suppose you wouldn't... that reminds me of march -- she can't remember her past. feels like everyone in the express crew has a mysterious background.
what what what? my ears are burning... did somebody say my name?
um... can you please answer the question we just asked?
eh, touched a nerve, did i? i'd have thought any adventurers who dare come here would be used to conversations like this.
the forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
...did you travel here alone?
lemme show you some fire tricks. first... fire! and then... whoosh! fire butterfly! be free!
...to penacony's past, present, future... and the child's unwavering dream unto death.
as inazuma's god, it is high time i honored their wishes.
a natural beauty like me never has dark circles!
only a deep commitment to his ambition to become the best made it possible for him to rise above the pain of these encounters -- to focus on the way ahead.
this is a place i once sealed off with my own hands... the entrance to raiden makoto's realm of consciousness.
found you! you ran all the way out here just to play hide-and-seek? it's too dangerous!
really? that's awesome. i bet everyone would love one of those.
even though the contents are completely different than what i was expecting...
correct. although it possessed shingo, it didn't have any ill intentions. as a matter of fact, it actually seemed like it was trying to train shingo to become bolder.
i believe you've seen this outfit before. it's one of my favorites.
yeah, yeahhhh, if you say so~
of course, i'm a genius astrologist. didn't i mention that my scryglass has recovered a little? i can sense what's going on here through divination.
lynxy, are you sure this is the place?
i'm sure he does. you didn't see him, but he was dressed like he was about to attend some important meeting. it wasn't anything like what someone would wear on vacation.
i didn't understand at the time. how can we say that we are maintaining eternity when things are constantly moving forward and evolving?
but, i think we can't just ignore the safety of penacony.
ah, i'm finished! no wonder... no wonder that old woman said that i should not look at it no matter what, or she'd rip me to shreds...
but i... i am still not a knight yet...
...ninja initiate gigaku, it seems our time for rest is coming to an end.
but if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then i hope its existence proves to be real.
these questions... have no meaning. but, i will answer you as best as i can: this is the border between reality and the memory zone, a... dreamscape.
if it's possible... may i borrow a few of the records on the express? just for two or three days... or even just one day will do.
of course, lady guuji. just tell us. whatever this condition is, i am ready to face it.
why do people choose to sleep? i think...
blitzara, you haven't completed your mission yet. you're not thinking of giving up now, are you?
rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
oh? dear me, don't you trust me? i'm heartbroken...
i've checked the lines, there don't seem to be any major problems. all that's left is the energy hub.
roping you in was possibly the most masterful move we could have made. i believe that future generations will say so too, when our deeds come up for their review.
i don't doubt that many challenges lie ahead for inazuma...
in that case, let's chat some more! i'm not in a rush, anyway.
yes... and now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
this moment has finally come... i always get stuck here for a long time, but it also means i'm getting to the endpoint.
none. no one has seen the devotee of eternity since she shut herself away. in fact, no one even knows what it looks like in there.
i wonder if this "friend" of mister wallace has anything to do with the museum thefts...
the only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
i've seen standard-issue robots like these before. it's an ipc field team leader.
in principle, i should remain an outside observer. but you are far too much fun for that. i can't help but tease you from time to time.
what do you mean, astrologists shouldn't be allowed to play? really! i would never use hydromancy to cheat...
a commission's power rises and falls with the trust of their people. thus, we cannot remain indifferent to this situation without also remaining indifferent to our own fate.
while quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact...
...you think so? i actually think it's pretty snazzy.
the silver lining is that apart from the mine incident you mentioned, there haven't been any major conflicts in other areas. i suppose topaz must have issued an order against harassing the citizenry.
make the most of the festivities -- you've earned it! you two and dan heng did help save jarilo-vi, after all. i'll be sure to join you guys next time.
no, no, no... gepard is a captain of the silvermane guards, just like how the luofu has its own cloud knights captains. i have no idea what he's doing running security at a hotel like this though.
anyway. it sounds like you had a very pleasant trip and even had the chance to see ei's less formal side.
according to micah, they died long ago.
dan heng! bronya just sent all of us a message. did you see it yet?
yeah, yeah. well, pack your souvenirs and stuff. back home we go!
cease the shady evasion! i urge you to come clean now! you're evil ninja osaru's fiendling chief, aren't you!?
that wubbaboo looked so upset. what happened to it...
*sigh* i understand. well, this photo will always be close to my heart. i'll make a copy for you too, clara.
they will be teaming up with us to collectively create the novel that knocks "a firsthand guide to summoning spirits" off its perch. so? feeling better about my plan now?
am i really that important to someone...? i don't think there's anyone who'd go to all the trouble of locking up my memories...
so, i'll pay extra attention to any leads that will let me live on. this trip to penacony is no different.
the evil ninja is about to set a matrix here. using the ninja tech left to me by master, i shall pave the way for those ninja heroes that are soon to arrive!
i'm guessing that her sudden illness made her feel like she may not be able to realize her dreams anymore. it also made it difficult for her to hold onto the happy memories and dreams she had.
yes, they're travelers from afar. outsiders have a very difficult time getting into inazuma nowadays.
hmm... not bad. sounds like something one of those old bands would play at the beginning of their sets...
whoa! why are you here!? ...and how did you get here before us?
i don't think you're lying, as anything can happen in a dream... we can just head to the place i mentioned later...
of course. thank you, master qingque.
hah, the nerve, saying that in the presence of me and ei! are you trying to find out whose lightning strikes faster?
*sigh* i knew this wouldn't be simple...
our approach so far has been too passive, and time has been against us every step of the way. we need to change our strategy, and we need to attack this problem at its source.
ugh... why do i feel like we're being played? anyway, let's forget about it for now, we can ask him in person next time we see him.
*sigh* i'd rather deal with monsters than these big shots...
the chief editor wrote to me a while ago about the bonus. thank goodness it's finally here, i was wondering when it would arrive. thank you, charlotte...
well, sure i can! if going to the wangsheng funeral parlor won't scare you silly.
i never would've guessed that gepard and you were brother and sister.
if my pops had a person like you around, his being deaf wouldn't hold things up all the time.
please, there's no need to make a fuss, we're just here to--
this momentary freedom has been a beautiful dream. i believe that one day, at some stop on the trailblaze, we will meet again.
i will introduce you to the raiden shogun, on one condition... you must fulfill three small wishes on my behalf.
come on, there's no reason to get upset. look, one of your members is an avid supporter of my proposition!
versemonger of the darkest alleys -- that's me!
hmm... let's head over and have a look. maybe we'll be able to find something there.
it's okay, i'm not here to see him. we just heard you calling out, so we came to see what was going on.
this dream... is becoming more and more separated from reality.
you're funny. if you can crack jokes, you're probably fine.
everyone sang so wonderfully! it's not often that i try this music style, but i've gained some valuable insights from it!
and what mister mikhail has left for us is his answer to this very question. it may not be perfect, but it left a smile on this storied, jaded old nameless' face at the end of his life.
is today the day of your creation? return to the city with me. i will read out a speech for you in front of all my attendants. "embarrassing"? ...understood.
...she's right. everyone, do you all still remember your surroundings during your entry into the dreamscape?
it's all about the bartender's pride. it wouldn't make sense for customers to come here and order drinks they can find anywhere else. that's the mindset i use when i brew my coffee.
took you long enough sleepy head. we've been waiting all day!
the general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. with the xianzhou alliance mediating, peace for penacony is within reach.
got it. he says the wind is too strong here at the port, so it's not easy to follow the scent.
here we go.... let's save the victory speeches for later.
i have other business to attend to now, otherwise i would gladly escort you to the site in person. when you do arrive, please seek out my secretary.
i hope quinn understands bea's intentions...
i will one day die, new qixing will replace the old, and liyue will continue to prosper.
eternity means never having to let go of what you already have. but on the other hand, it also means giving up on all other possibilities. that's just the way of the world... no one can have everything.
do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? or... was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
wait, what? no way -- we're about to leave and i've hardly got any decent photos.
wait, do we have a non-swimmer among us?
the blade that i inherited from makoto seems to be trying to guide me... to encourage me.
then let us snap them all out of their disillusionment!
all of you here are my distinguished guests. i am determined that each of you thoroughly enjoys yourself.
hu as in "who put me in this coffin?" and tao as in "i can't get out!" hehe... no, not funny?
i never thought i'd hear that word again after being expelled by the architects... come on, i'll tell you everything.
they probably didn't indulge her forever. based on the voice, this was surely a memory from her childhood? it's a different story now she's grown up.
every day all i hear is "remember who you are, bronya," "this is against the architects' admonishments, bronya," "ladies shouldn't use such foul language, bronya"...
i have no doubt that she immensely enjoyed that drink. i'm sure she was as happy as can be.
circumstances have changed since then -- there's a silvermane guard down here now! is that part of svarog's calculation? not to mention, we're--
since my physical form is here in this realm, i suppose there's no harm in seeing how you've utilized its infinitesimal space.
are those books on the bookshelf logbooks left behind by that seafarer?
alas, i arrived a little later than usual. i sincerely apologize for any unpleasantness during your stay.
this light cone... is securely guarded. it must hold some important memories.
just think about it. an adventurer's life is full of unexpected threats. it's only natural to take precautions. "mend the roof before it rains," as they say.
oh, um, we have to look for one of our own later -- to make the purest lens.
...i will arrest you under the supreme guardian's decree. nothing has changed.
what about me? oh, i'm staying up to have a drink or two, maybe read a couple of interesting light novels...
did the general just spare us a walk with kafka? i knew he was a good guy~
phew! i can already feel the spiciness just by listening to your description! ...will i be able to handle it?
i'm just going to have a polite discussion with those two grown-ups about what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.
yes, i understand. cherish this moment, for it can help you remember the path you've traveled.
yes, of course. i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving them alone with those two buffoons.
hee-hee, just telling it like i see it.
the divination shows that these meteorites came from someone's constellation.
i can protect you from harm, but in the memory zone, i'll need assistance from the memokeeper as well. and... if we run into the family, it wouldn't hurt to have one more person to explain the situation.
himeko and mister yang are probably still busy... let's go look for dan heng first.
thorough preparation is the key to victory, after all!
more curious than my appearance is the fact that she and i don't see each other anymore, wouldn't you say?
got it. it was over there, right? we'll be going now. thanks!
that's the spirit! strike while the iron is hot!
thank you for your assistance, miss alley. by the way... is miss robin doing fine? we are looking forward to her performance.
*sigh*, i'm not sure you guys will agree, but...
before we departed, the conductor asked us to inquire about the three nameless in penacony. we've already collect intel about razalina and tiernan, so the only one left is legwork.
the masked fools... so this really was their doing.
no problem, we were in the area anyway. what did you want to discuss with us?
thanks, clara~ let's get on to the next area, then.
w--wait a minute! this isn't what we agreed! she said we were gonna be escorted to discuss an urgent matter!
i'm just stating the obvious! the way i see it, the museum's reopening is a very significant event... and worth remembering more than any other time in the past.
now now, this is a grown-up situation, okay? it's not fun and games anymore. and don't try and follow me.
speaking of dates, if you're struggling to decide, please do come and talk it over. i'd hate to see you still alive and kicking when your big day comes.
this is also the only place where one can fully experience the core values of syrupism...
please. kindness has nothing to do with it.
what? you just matched up those symbols. is that it?
don't keep it a secret next time you come to inazuma, okay? just be sure to visit naganohara fireworks first and tell me all about the amazing things you've seen on your journey.
i never thought that the underworld would sink into such ruin without the silvermane guards... perhaps mother was wrong...
yes, i've been preparing myself mentally for a long time. if i back out now, it'll be a huge loss.
brother! what a surprise to see you again.
come on. the auction is being held at yujing terrace.
okay. next, i will show you a secret kitsune spell. this painting is a "swift summoning medium," which means i'll be able to skip many of the more tedious steps.
*sniff* it smells delicious... you're an excellent cook, traveler.
if someone shows a naganohara that paper slip, we guarantee we can make the exact same firework as the original one they purchased, whether it's ten or even a hundred years later.
precisely the problem! if we can't get that feeling across, then how will we get return clients?
oh! no, sorry. life in the underworld is difficult, i shouldn't be speaking about it so lightly.
(i think she actually really enjoys it...)
given my background, i'm happy to have made it this far.
(i think it was mister yang who promised us xianzhou delicacies earlier? wouldn't wanna steal his thunder, hee-hee...)
what can i say... sounds like a lynxy expedition alright.
it was a song with a harmonic tune.
if you wore clothes that i made for you...
but as time went by, i received so many thank-you gifts and letters from people... everyone was describing how they now saw me in a new light, how i'd become an inspiration to them.
yes... if it hadn't been for you, i would not have been able to participate.
ahhhh, which means... what exactly!? this is a starship! there are all kinds of devices making weird noises.
she gave the order to expel me herself and refused to see me... i never understood that behavior, and i gave up trying to use logic to work it out a long time ago.
so they just jumped inside that tv...
umm... i'm not sure i fully understand what you mean...
oh, stop it, you two. i think both of you were sensational!
our little hunting game ends here!
i'd love to know where you picked this thing up.
a frostening bottle... a fitting gift for one of the four drunkards.
hey, come on, don't make fun! it's just because i used to have the same concerns that my mother did... but now, i think i don't need to worry about it so much.
what about you, then? is this the moment you finally find the "death" you've been looking for?
general, are you... okay?
wait wait wait, why are you talking just like the old hag!?
nevertheless, i do have a few matters i should like to entrust to you here today.
*sigh* what can we do? if even the honorary knight can't find them...
so long, my friends. may the preservation bless your journey.
hehe... before you can answer that question, you have to understand your target audience.
knights of favonius handbook article two: "do not exhibit suspicion or hostility towards visitors, no matter how suspicious they may seem."
i don't know if it's rude of me to ask, but how is this kind of snack actually made?
let's take the pickled radish to satoru. he's over on the other side of the village.
yae publishing house released several new novels recently. shigeru told me that a good number of them are children's fairy tales -- perfect for reading aloud to kids.
so is this a real musket?
yo, ninja ruri! yo, silvergun shura!
i--i won't put on any weight since this is all a dream...
but i'm proud that i was born into the naganohara family, and have the chance to make so many pretty fireworks.
*chuckle* paimon, don't worry, wearing a mask is optional...
i'm afraid so. the festival is coming to a close.
yes, but the rule of the game is no fishing rods allowed. we're going fishing by hand.
ahaha, someone's scared, huh? well, then, i'll go first.
but tell me, why should this concern me? why should i do this for you, when i already have everything one could ever want, and have seen everything one could ever wish to see?
how does the saying go? "trouble comes in pairs"...
but what i really saw was just another child, and asked all the same things everyone else did, about rugs, spices, cooking, and the differences between here and home.
pleasure to meet you, mister giovanni.
the balladeer is no. six of the fatui harbingers. in terms of strength, he is superior to signora.
...life must be quite difficult for them in reality, i imagine.
so it's a recording device. diting must have heard its signal and called us over here to investigate.
i've always believed that children are the most naive and innocent. the reports they give me are of the most value. so what about you? what will you have for me?
huh? so that snowy planet is our destination this time?
what's going on... they're completely ignoring the baron bunny...
that's the key to the mystery, march. now, take a moment to recall...
and given the looks of you two, i presume that you are here to celebrate the lantern rite?
let's head towards the first victory zone -- corridor of fading echoes!
the shogun, for example, is one of my forms of existence. the question of whether or not she is me is not determined by any of her components.
a blade embraces its duty as a jeweler cherishes their gems.
we haven't figured out everything about it yet, but there's one thing we're sure of... they have the power to control people. we need to be careful.
hehe, guinaifen's enthusiasm is super contagious, i hope we bump into her again.
ode to fool... this must be the second act.
yes. that's where the main force of the silvermane guards is stationed. they've consolidated their position there in order to resist the encroaching fragmentum.
i vow to the subjects of inazuma that i shall one day return. this is my oath. please be my witness.
y--you think so? ...i suppose if the goal is set so high that i couldn't hope to achieve it immediately, i won't be too disappointed day to day...
i can't believe you haven't heard of him. he was a legendary tycoon in the history of penacony -- the founder of the dreamscape, the man who turned dreams into reality!
i do trust miss march seventh's taste. actually, i just tried picking out a few designs with her, but she now seems more conflicted than i am...
how could this happen... miss robin...
to be honest, i think i'd be kind of annoyed if i found out this was my homeworld. it looks freezing... pretty girls aren't frost-resistant!
before pursuing the eternity of her nation, she had to reach eternity for herself.
i've been thinking since the last camping trip that it would be great if i can go somewhere even further than the snow plains.
a dream world... i heard that penacony transformed the dreamscape into a majestic metropolis...
how lamentable you are! please, bear with me for now. i vow to defeat evil ninja osaru and restore your ninja forms.
i'm impressed you can still think up jokes right now...
oh? so you're a mind reader now, too...?
since no one's around to entertain us, let's make ourselves at home. stay close to me so that my "white" can cover you, too.
stop moving around! let's see if there's a way to help you recover faster.
phew... miss topaz wasn't kidding... mister giovanni really knows his stuff!
(i--it kinda works, right...?)
i wouldn't worry. it's all work you'll be quite familiar with -- planning trips, gathering pertinent information, that sort of thing.
to that point, as you know, the prototype of the jade chamber chess piece has been in the works for a long time, but i haven't once followed up on the progress.
l--let's look at another one... you have to learn the basics first, after all...
...please don't do this. he seems like a good guy! hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
the bro or the sis? if you're talking about gepard, we should be careful... he's a top silvermane guard -- he'd probably get a medal for every one of us he brought in.
even to this very day, liyue and its lands have stood the test of time, immovable as stone, just as it was thousands of years before. this is truly no small feat.
i have a couple of hunches, but i can't prove any at this point. so, they'll be my little secrets for now.
conversely, if your stars go off track, everything will get worse.
i'm afraid this is all i had time for...
i wanted to bring these numbers, these "probabilities" to light. i think it's only fair that you know all the facts before making a decision.
ugh, there's no way through here, we need to think of a way to cut her off!
that was some speech, bronya! if i had to talk like that in front of a huge crowd, i'd be shaking head to toe!
payment is one aspect of it. but i also compensate her in other ways... hehe, let's just say it's a little complicated.
eternity... eternity is the only way...
experience is always the best teacher -- so go ahead and try for yourselves with these two lamps!
still, you needn't worry. he won't escape. you'll see once you get back to the tournament arena.
we'll be sticking to the order i placed in advance. as for the other matter we discussed... thank you for your help.
nah, i don't think so. i don't like you.
ah, speaking of which... actually, i feel that i still owe you a formal apology, for... that matter with "the performer of the iris family."
oh yes, thank you for preparing these! if you're not averse, you're welcome to try some as well.
just reading it makes me sentimental. this must be what people call "the power of art."
what would we do if we were the escapees from the shackling prison? while we can disguise ourselves and blend in with the crowd, we don't plan on staying here for long. in this case, what do we need most now?
i've seen those lights too! it looks so lively with so many people -- and it's so brightly lit it makes the whole sky glow... of course, sometimes it does make me a bit anxious from a public order perspective.
hehe, it wasn't a big deal, really...
are you going to help this... um, clockie that only you can see?
alright then. i hope the next time we meet, you will either have already done the right thing... or, will be about to make the right call.
the tvs are so bright, it's hurting my eyes... careful, something's up...
but then i'd be just like everyone else out on the streets...
is this order really correct? lemme see...
absolutely! i've learned a lot from my adventures!
that's exactly what everyone back then told me as well. that it had existed since time immemorial. they were so matter-of-fact about it, and couldn't at all understand what i was so surprised about.
they said they were doing an overhaul, but it looked like they had no idea how to operate the starskiff production line, right?
i wouldn't call it liveable just yet, but things are looking up. i'm so happy for bronya and seele.
yeah, you wouldn't believe what we saw there! two mechanical puppets that were dancing together! you've already seen them, right?
it's just as well, really, with the amount of effort it took me to get you back here. honestly, it was like you were glued to the ground back there.
i'm going up against skott soon. do you know why i'm visiting you, qingque?
there once was a fontaine musicianwho went around town on a missionhe came door to doorfor his iridescence tourlooking for acts to audition
no more unnerving gaze this time! hehe...
the coast is clear. you can come out now.
huh? even you're saying that, mister yang? how powerful is that dreammaster?
r--really? so under your personal guidance i completed the training? what an honor!
i'm sorry. for certain reasons, there are things i can't reveal to you yet. but there are also things you should know.
riddle number one! let me see here... uh, this riddle is, uh... unique. especially the handwriting...
well, i've gained a deeper understanding of swordplay, and i'm more aware of my own strengths now.
they do. the architects believe that hell can exist on any world -- a plight that will inevitably come to be without intervention.
hehe, how amusing. the almighty shogun goes downtown and suddenly she's like a wide-eyed country girl trying to find her bearings in the big city. marvelous.
yes, the whole point of a summoning ritual is for a dead person's spirit to possess a living person's body.
you left all your subordinates back there to guard the road, making sure no one else followed you here. seems to me like you were hoping for a chance to talk.
doesn't seem like it, everything else is working fine -- see?
the destination is... the island over there.
precisely. according to the rules i designed for her, matters of this nature are to be delegated to the tri-commission.
oh, so that's what happened! thank you, miss black swan.
now that you mention it, there is one thing that has always concerned me. the shogun's army has been at war with the resistance for a long time now, but not once has the shogun ever inquired about it.
i am indeed. many of them, in fact.
alright, if there's nothing else, then move along. i'm waiting for march...
ugh... i can't bear to watch. if anything happens to master masakatsu, our whole plan will have been for nothing...
i'm pleased to see how well everyone's been getting along. topaz, based on your greeting i presume you have a good grasp of the current situation?
thank you all very much. i promise you that i will create a bright future for inazuma.
my answer isn't necessarily correct. besides, it's first-come, first-served, and you beat me to it...
there's also the saying: "from misfortune comes bliss."
hey mister, are you manning the counter for the young shopkeeper of spare time book shop?
hee-hee! that look on your face... i'll stop teasing you.
is that so...? hey, you don't just think of me as some research-obsessed maniac with a one-track mind, do you?
legend holds that he was free-spirited and easy-going. people described him as a cheerful soul and a loyal friend.
*sigh* as long as it's there, we can't get any closer.
i see... in that case, please tell me we can put it back?
so, um... traveler, i... ahem...
i'm sorry, master yanqing, master yunli... i lost...
this power is beyond the limits of my understanding.
the complex locality of this world has been... affected somehow. the star rail has been blocked off by something.
(you think that would stop the likes of luocha? what kind of a stellaron smuggler would he be if he couldn't get past a door?)
i'm sorry dunn... time for a little nap.
haha, i was ready ages ago. *sigh* i've been here so many times before, it should've been just an ordinary trip for me.
dan heng, do you even have a heart? did you lose it somewhere?
...yes, we haven't seen any aeon or emanator-level imaginary reactions. relax.
i know what i'm doing, dunn! step aside.
n--no problem, merely fulfilling my duties as a maid of favonius!
i think it'd be better if the ipc avoided it... it sounds pretty dangerous.
...before we set off, i told march seventh and dan heng about this.
you can go look for them. you youngsters should get along well.
huh...? you're leaving so soon?
again, we'll just have to trust guuji yae. she is close to the shogun, so maybe she will have a way...
but... the book said that it was the most popular place in mondstadt...
looks like you haven't put enough thought into this, little one.
eyelashes? clockie doesn't have those...
the angler mystery -- the novel! there's a scene that's identical to this footage.
all those who sacrificed themselves back then gave their lives fighting for a future... but perhaps the future they were hoping for is not the eternity that i once strove for.
mmm... you have surpassed my expectations again.
you may think it somewhat strange, perhaps even rude, but i wish to know...
now that is an interesting question.
congratulations, little ones. you've passed the third round of the test of courage.
quite a lot. i'm most interested in that commercial organization -- the interastral peace corporation.
...did i get too worked up all of a sudden? my vision... seems a bit blurry...
which means... seele shouldn't be appearing in this memory. she's the source of the interference.
in our family we have a strong military tradition going back generations -- many a landau has died in their prime. there's not a lot of "brother and sister time." everyone just does their best to get on with their life.
ha, my observational skills are second to none.
woah, it's intense! it's as if something is biting my tongue.
you are like a storybook hero, so awesome.
you're right! those roots never grew back!
this should cover food and rent for a while!
this guy is pretty deluded for a "master..."
you underestimate me, fischl! i'm far stronger than you seem to think.
mm... that makes sense. if that's the case, i vote for the agate world too.
how... how about windrise?
i wonder what silver wolf did to my sword. can i really defeat skott?
in that case, i'll report the situation to swan. let's meet back at the gates of the city a little later.
nothing. i suddenly want some fried tofu.
this is the interior of the penacony grand theater.
basically speaking, it's a train that travels through space. but more specifically, the astral express was a creation of the aeon, akivili the trailblazer.
that's right, and you are...?
hmph, what did you think? did that satisfy your expectations?
perhaps that's what n was trying to tell you. not to lose heart, and to believe that what you were seeing playing out before you is not yet set in stone.
yep, the same paper slips as the ones i gave to the kids earlier. whenever a customer orders fireworks for a commemorative event, we always include a little paper slip with the goods.
i don't need you to absolve me. the truth is, i didn't have every confidence that i was doing the right thing, but the sense of duty to carry out an order is bound to prevail with me.
come on, how could i possibly lose?
mister yanming said an amicassador will return with a gift for a trusted colleague...
astute. evil ninja osaru... it's definitely evil ninja osaru.
the tuning test is up next.
lies are worthless before astrology. destiny and truth are written in the stars.
mikhail char legwork, we raise a toast to you, watchmaker of the land of the dreams, nameless of the astral express...
will do. you look after yourself as well. don't push yourself too hard -- you don't wanna make yourself ill again.
guess it can't be the belobog caveman then... do cavemen even know how to write?
seems like my subconscious mind has no talent for screenwriting.
now this is a topic very much worth getting into. just as we are guests of the watchmaker, why don't we make ourselves comfortable in penacony before getting to know each other more elaborately?
also, thank you for helping us. actually, let me scrap the pleasantries and give you a heartfelt compliment instead!
...it worked. you really can walk up walls.
but that doesn't matter. whether i can see them or not doesn't change my belief that you can.
i'm going too. we can't let these thugs get away with whatever they like!
yes, it's just i didn't get the chance to say hello. there's still some time before charmony festival starts. do you want to chat?
from the sound of it, it seems like you're asking me to leave penacony.
hey, enough pessimism! back in my "official capacity" days, i spent a lot of time in the north -- i got to know the soldiers and officers on the front line very well.
the youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
traveler, paimon, please accept my sincerest apologies for delaying your meal.
yeah, i'm pretty confident too.
the three we saw just now were all people i suspected of being followed by big g. but having seen them, i didn't sense the presence of anything otherworldly.
my informants often provide me with extremely important information. it's only fair that i endeavor to meet any requests they have in return.
when i'm in danger, i instinctively create ice to protect myself.
i can tell from your report that the new supreme guardian of belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. what's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
the adventurers' guild? you can get stronger just by... passing their exam? ...ohh, that sounds a little difficult to believe...
please! you thought your crude replicas could keep me out? you appear to have woefully underestimated who you're dealing with...
yes, however... if she is telling the truth and we turn a deaf ear, then those on the luofu will be in great danger.
when we scour the universe for the things we seek, most of the time it's less of a "eureka, i found it!" moment and more of a "is this it? what if i'm wrong?" moment.
troubles? well, i mean... that's life, isn't it? there will always be things that don't go one's way. but i do not wish to worry those around me on account of things that are my concern alone... so, it is best if i keep them to myself.
did destiny's slave make you do it?
no one can live forever, jiaoqiu... this time, i must break my promise.
hmm... after doing my shopping, i'll get all dolled up in an evening gown to attend miss robin's show at penacony grand theater!
(finally, mister yang approves detective march's theory!)
i am, in fact, after the watchmaker's legacy, but that doesn't mean we have to go our separate ways and be enemies. but at least... i hope things won't turn out that way.
it's just... i wasn't sure how you'd feel about the idea of dressing in inazuman attire...
*sigh* fine, i'll leave him alone then. we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
thank you, but i didn't really do anything.
and then those chips simply disappeared? ah, it appears... to be the dreamsim tech the iris family has been developing.
this all feels very suspicious. there must be more to this than he is letting on.
hmm... i still have some of the materials we used when she taught me. there's just a few extra things i'd need...
i understand now. when i asked sakujirou why he came back, he just said "because of past mistakes" and wasn't willing to elaborate.
we don't have much time, pela! bronya wants to get everyone's opinion.
it was at once a familiar feeling and a strange one... makoto barely wielded a blade in her life, and yet her blade brings me closer to her.
the tenryou commission will definitely be chasing after him.
a gorgeous tail like yours deserves lots of tender loving care. hehe... don't you agree?
*sigh* velite just left the express too -- he looked really upset. i guess he didn't know what argenti was thinking, either...
maybe, but the ones outside just seem like a waste of energy.
thank you for the kind compliments. actually, as soon as director furina said "action," i told myself not to think about anything. i just felt the weight of the moment, and became the character.
family... huh, weird.
are you sure? okay then. oh, traveler, do you still have the omamori i gave you?
...i'm about to duel with skott, but i always feel like my fighting skills haven't improved enough! can i really defeat skott? i'm starting to worry!
we were just talking about her, as it happens. little layla told me that haniyyah gave you some guidance when you first entered the tournament. but after you met layla, she very abruptly left.
come on, asta has been worried about all of you.
i have something else for you also: an aether expansion chip. integrating its data into an aether spirit will grant them new, innate abilities.
this lady... is really something else!
the memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. in the memory zone of penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by black swan.
like how you're always pretending to be quiet?
when she was younger? oh, actually... now that you mention it, this does remind me of the fashionista phase she wrote about in her diary...
i am indisputably an erudite scholar, for my learning encompasses the stars above and earth below.
i can't believe that happened to miss robin... "the strong defending the weak" is a great mantra, but if i had to pay such a price... i, i don't know what i'd do...
...oh, mister charles also asked me to clear the tables on the second floor...
those guys can't think outside the box. of course they can't wrap their heads around my design. *sigh* i thought it was something big. leave it here. i'll take a look.
hmm... this area is sheltered and facing the sun, plus it's flat ground, but...
that's for sure. although our diplomatic relations with snezhnaya haven't broken down completely, i dealt them a rather ruthless blow with the size of the reparations payment i imposed.
did you talk to dan heng? how'd it go?
well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
if it were me, i'd want roses.
well whatever, we won... thanks to that giant robot, we were finally able to take care of the stellaron... and bronya made a promise -- the underworld and the overworld will soon be reunited.
the good news is that we're almost done filming now, and i would even say that this is the best story i've ever seen!
march hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
you probably imagine that mingxing jewelry deals exclusively in expensive luxury goods.
when i first saw it, i was in awe too. the sky here, it's like... a reflection of the twelve dreamscapes.
i've heard so much about you, mister alfalfa. it's an honor to meet you as representative of the astral express.
you're the companion everyone needs. i think we're all very relieved to have you here.
how deep a fully loaded vessel will sit in the water varies from ship to ship. but it's something you can tell from experience, at least for the kinds of vessels you see regularly.
don't worry! if you eat like dan heng, you'll be as tall as him one day! *stifled laughter*
and just in case you were wondering, we are on business, too! we only tried xiangling's dish since we just happened to be here.
even though i swing my blade with greater force than my opponent, i always seem to lose in the final moments.
take them. i have no need.
all the preparations for the ritual have actually been made well in advance. remember the incantation and the mention of "moonless night" that i added to our novel?
well then, shall i tell you now which objects you have on you that are stolen?
in other words, even though i can't pinpoint the exact spatial location of this realm, i can still send you to where ei is.
if i had known you'd pay me a visit, i would have spent more time getting ready...
shh, keep your voice down. don't let iwao and the others hear you.
she can't even make things up anymore. you have more evidence, right?
i just gave him the low-down. hey, remember what i said, okay? we're gonna vote against it! i'm not gonna take orders from that woman.
so it's not that you wish upon shooting stars, but that wishes summon them?
i was always meticulous with the most menial of tasks. my mother always loved that about me.
come on! don't think like that! leave the adult matters to the adults. even if you wanted to do something for the general, it's not like you can do anything.
i am astrologist mona megistus, meaning "the great astrologist mona." if it is divination you seek from me, then i ask you respect my name by learning it wholly, here and now.
the tea society is just a code name, did you think they'd call themselves the evil society? they have to have a nice-sounding name to conceal themselves!
when you are ready, go to hanamizaka, and look for a fireworks shop run by the naganohara family. there, you will find someone who can help you.
...heh, you truly have changed. i suppose this is what humans call "growth."
right? i knew you'd have a discerning eye to appreciate my poetry.
is it possible that the jolt just now damaged the express? ...did something manage to sneak in?
...me? have we met?
you took your time. i was starting to wonder if you got lost walking on the seabed, miss "sole of the deep."
i'll have to find time to thank miss fu xuan properly. i really owe her one.
nope, she seemed normal to me too. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
hmm... i'm not against miss himeko's choice, but edo star sounds like it's in danger. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
i mean... it's possible. but i can't help but wonder why he's so keen for us to speed up.
i trust you remember our agreement? if you keep your lips firmly sealed, i, too, shall uphold my end of the deal.
oh, i actually wanted to ask you as well. how did you feel when you saw that stretch of sky?
wait a minute, so we're actually looking for wubbaboos, not passes?
huh? oh, uh... let me think... "hey sis, the energy supply lines in the restricted zone have malfunctioned. those useless engineers can't find the problem." something like that...
you have to be more specific, captain beidou.
now's a time for action, i'm gonna go check my room. if there's a problem, i'll let you know...
well, he is a spirit. it's quite normal that he looks just like he did when he left this world.
hmm. well, i think it was a combination of the weight and the energy it contains.
i... i'm satisfied...
what are the chances of one star encountering another? are these encounters not the most wonderful miracles in all of destiny? ...i don't know.
...i simply wouldn't know where to begin.
don't worry. she stands out. she's blonde like us and, um... quite short. she's always wearing a white fur hat... if i'm right, she should be waiting for someone at the city exit closest to the snow plains.
...oh, sorry, i'm doing my tour guide thing again. i'm sure someone as well-traveled as yourself has seen much fancier equipment than this.
...you're really into clockie, huh? he's just a fictional character, not a real person!
huh, that was fine? you both understand what i'm trying to say? honestly, i thought it was pretty messy...
hmm, i wouldn't want ordinary folks to become superstitious... the less they know, the better.
in short, klee gave fischl an island to serve as the promised land where the immernachtreich will reappear. i didn't believe it either at first, but then i saw this letter.
to me, this work is highly sensitive and of utmost importance, though i'm sure you will find it to be mundane at best. it would not surprise me if you can't bear the tedium or can't make the time...
my schedule is usually very tightly packed, and any extra time i can squeeze out is spent on preparing for the future.
...ahem. i digress. come on, let's finish the job we came to do.
let's start from where you found those borisin and corner our prey.
fine by me. let's do it!
but after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
no one would have ever thought that you would have gone to such lengths, even staking your life, just to prove a fact that had seemingly been disproved long ago...
don't worry about me fainting from hunger. in any case, i've figured out a way to make some money...
true, but the story doesn't end there. that samurai's name was yanagibashi takuto, who also happens to be the founder of the souran isshin art.
as things are, all she can do is sit alone and think about how happiness is leaving her little by little, about how life has been so unfair to her...
the construction of the new jade chamber is now officially complete. once the tethers are released, it will soar into the sky.
huh? i don't think so. why are you suddenly asking me that?
the debt owed is an astronomical amount. i don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
yes, i know you will do great, traveler.
see these musical instruments playing themselves with no human performers? that's the sweet dreams troupe.
and yet, that sense of disorderliness has now completely disappeared.
then please stand well back, where it is safe. now... it is time for me to honor my word.
we are lucky... the damage is not too serious. the yashiro commission will be able to nurse the root system back to health.
but today, those words seem to carry a different meaning.
nay, ninja initiate merchant! the other initiates have verified that these fiendling puppets are from your shop. confess at once! are you under the spell of evil ninja osaru?
seems like you young people have similar tastes.
hmph, showing your true colors now that your evil schemes have been exposed? they're calling for their fellow ape fiendlings. please take cover behind me!
got it, it's all etched into my memory.
the fact you're asking means you've got your heart set on it already, right? great!
and fox envoys are nothing new. stories have been told about them in inazuma since ancient times.
well, it is a little abstract, but basically you just need to pinpoint what's bothering you.
i want it to remain in my heart and become a secret between the two of us.
sorry, i'm also not sure. all i know is that the power is not hostile at the moment. whatever it is, it doesn't seem to harbor any ill will toward us.
what do you say, klee? sounds like the irodori festival could be a real blast!
i'm sorry. i had no other choice...
do you have to go back already? time really flies.
is that all you care about!?
hitomi, go tell the others that the test of courage has ended and that we have a winner.
not exactly... i was thinking that you would be involved in the decision itself.
so, while festivals are undoubtedly joyous and lively occasions, for us they are also a cause for concern...
standing idly by and watching them sign an unfair contract... goes against everything the nameless are about.
perhaps some of you will have heard the news already. i am, in fact, planning to rebuild the jade chamber.
so, a pawn of the destruction wanted a flesh-and-blood body to live in? hmm, interesting. that's quite a new perspective.
the situation gets more interesting with each development... blitzara injured pyro-one soon after the match started, and haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
every time i'm done sorting my album and look out the window, i always want to take another picture... even though i've seen the view a thousand times, i still feel happy looking at the stars like this.
how many more of your comrades are here? where were you planning to meet hoolay?
be good kids and stay out of trouble, alright? stay in the city for now, and i'll come play with you after the fireworks start.
yes, but more importantly, they're on the verge of an outburst. if that happens, the consequences will be unthinkable.
that's what i'd like to know. if they're here to look for findie, then they're more than just a little late.
there's a huge star in the sky and you're only interested in the clouds?
i--i'd just like to ask, how much do the current dishes cost in total?
if you want my opinion, there's nothing amiss with ninja initiate gigaku's acting. in fact, you are being overly critical of her.
got it. he was just worried about me. relax, silver wolf. you know me.
at that time, i dreamed that one day the jade chamber's shadow would be seen in all seven nations of teyvat.
while the position of tianquan remains mine, i will always ensure liyue's safety.
i'll let sakujirou know after we get back.
the grand notion of eternity she once held has long since given way to the eternity of her own definition.
now that the stellaron crisis is over, we've been able to allocate more manpower to the renovation works. the museum should be open to the public again soon.
let's take it back to her right away. i hope we haven't kept her waiting too long...
since the battle, the shogun has been greatly troubled and her temperament has changed drastically.
(i don't know if diona's father mentioned the part about the kiss to her...)
phew... finally. i think i must have left cadet school with about the same amount...
it's virtually impossible to destroy a stellaron. no one, not even herta, has found a way to break its structure. the best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
oh, it's called "the two musketeers," right? i read the script you sent me on the way here, the story is pretty good!
we'll be one step closer to mining once i've taken care of it! leave it to me!
it was nothing, grace. i merely taught them how to sing. it was you who brought hope into their lives.
sorry, i don't know if i can. i've only just arrived in sumeru. maybe i haven't seen one yet, or maybe i can't see them at all.
i guess you're right, it's actually pretty warm in the city... hey, what's with all the children over there? should we go and take a look?
i'm fine, i just... i haven't rested in a while. there's just too much happening all at once...
okay, this ought to do the trick.
based on these fragmented pieces of information, it seems firefly's companion betrayed her halfway and trapped her alone in this room, disappearing without a trace... but why?
what a shame he will never get to see that.
you actually found it. not bad.
well... that's because i would also like to take on the guardian of the box.
this old man's words... always catch me off guard.
if you wanna make sure you don't burn yourself out or stifle your creativity, then don't push yourself too hard at work~
no, no, that will never do. things cost what they cost, and what they cost is what i shall pay.
yeah, while i'm smart, learning swordplay sounds like a whole lot of work.
everyone, listen up. i will personally take charge of starskiff haven, evacuate the people, and prepare for any possible attacks. i will do my best to ensure that things are safe on the ground.
yes, there does seem to be a large number of millelith stationed at the harbor. it would be great if i can learn something from them.
oh yes, the story of a spring fairy who left her homeland, and met a boy under the moonlight in a faraway land.
*sigh* how can i ever become a real knight of favonius like this...?
let the soldiers recuperate. but don't let your guard down -- if she returns with a vengeance, we must be prepared.
...we will transfer ownership of the radiant feldspar to the astral express! a meager appreciation that we hope you will accept with grace.
his expertise is limitless, stretching from the celestial orbs to the terrestrial ores, spanning modern and ancient culture, delving into literature both prosaic and poetic.
a wise judgment. you have the aptitude to become a ninja master too.
let me see which one we should try first...
the secret of penacony... may be closely related to the trailblaze.
hey, whose side are you on!? i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
sea gazer. i believe you're familiar with the name?
hmm... then, why don't we go back to sumeru city and ask the blacksmith?
i have my ways. i would never subject myself to imprisonment voluntarily.
dear customer, wangsheng funeral parlor does appreciate your patronage, but you needn't hasten the inevitable! are you alright?
seriously? who puts a lamp there... there's no way we can directly load the thermic core into this one...
most people accepted his apology, although there are some who said that they'll reserve judgment until they've seen how he acts in the future.
oh please, spare me that look. i didn't sign up for any of this. i'm supposed to be having a nice vacation, but all sorts of vexing issues keep managing to find their way to me...
this mural is pretty interesting... looks like time hasn't had any effect on it.
oh! no, not at all! i could do with a hand, actually...
aeons, paths, and factions... these concepts all feel so distant to me, yet their existence cannot be denied.
another example is the genius society: there is no shortage of eccentrics like madam herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the erudition.
today, at long last, you and inazuma finally emerge from the shadows cast by the events of centuries past.
come to think of it, maybe i shouldn't have left him alone. take me with you if you're going after him!
does it... look like the palm of a huge hand to you?
we also got some parts of the sculpture back. it's not a lot, but it's a start.
agreed. whoever it is will continue to follow us.
in bending over backwards trying to warn everyone about the dangers, all we would accomplish is to create more curious readers ready to try them out. also, sales for the book would only increase further.
i will start the ritual preparations shortly, and at that time, i need you to do two things:
i don't know. unless left with no other choice, astrologers do not foretell their own fate. the elders of my art warned against it, for it can turn fate in on itself, which is incredibly dangerous.
oh no! sucrose's lab equipment! i should go help her carry it!
so a photo is a visual representation... an impression, like casting a shadow...
your words alone will not suffice. ninja initiate merchant, is this truly your intention?
although... it felt like she was looking through me. as in, i know she was speaking to us, but it seemed like her gaze was fixed on something far away...
hehe, everything went according to plan. people started to panic as soon as they sensed that they had no idea what was happening. ah, how amusing.
but the fact is that both the food and the stories have changed with time...
huh? ah... i thought i'd finally get to see himeko and mister yang go out on a mission together. oh well, take care then, mister yang!
cocolia... let's settle this bad blood right here, right now!
that shouldn't be necessary... but if it makes the nameless feel less defensive, i'll be happy to abide.
ah but you see, i wasn't referring to clients in the business sense. everyone who enters this mortal realm will be a client of mine.
hahaha! i say that, but i do have a travel goal: to see teyvat's grandest meteor shower.
so... you do have secret strength!?
alright, i won't disturb you two any longer. bye-bye, now.
gepard... brother. surely now you can see the need for pragmatism?
you. yes, you. come with me.
at least she's not trying to arrest us anymore.
however, the advice you gave me will benefit you as well...
time to rest again. i hope there aren't any surprises this time.
phew... thank you. i was actually a little nervous.
absolutely! i wield my sword to become a hero! i want to fight for justice, punish the wicked, and make them quiver in fear and run away when they see me!
then it's settled! everyone else in the audience, feel free to join in too, and support your favorite team!
yeah, it's less suspicious than all three of us joining the club together. let's split up for now. this way, you two can also keep an eye on what's going on in the campus.
also, consider this: you have to have the naganoharas, because so many people are emotionally invested in the existence of fireworks.
but that "someone" doesn't have to be you or anyone in particular. you're carrying too much on your shoulders, brother.
ahh... can you hear the anemo archon's voice on the breeze? it calms me down whenever i get flustered.
this body is an assistant to the one within. but it is also the guardian of the rules.
can you help me keep this secret? the raining chips... were supposed to be part of my act.
a dreamchaser story... if i acted out of kindness, i would probably ask the bloodhounds to stop their pursuit and lend him a hand.
through the author's eyes, i can immerse myself in the sights that only they have seen. even if the subject is well-known to me, i am able to gain a deeper level of appreciation for it.
you can still run, jump, and talk as usual. everything seems normal, but then you'll start doing everything slightly slower than others...
of course -- i wouldn't ask you to start a whole investigation from scratch.
now, they're much further ahead in their studies and far more mature than their peers. this has given them confidence in themselves.
which explains why they were reluctant to pry and find out the full story. which is just as well -- because if they had attempted to... it would have been too much for me to deal with.
yes, well, at the time, it seemed to me that sacrificing the jade chamber was the inevitable decision.
ah, lighten up! the way i see it, people make death scarier than it really is.
i never said that...! his strength may exceed mine by a hair's breadth... but in astrology alone, he doesn't come close!
indeed, she was the first to discover the world beyond the shores of "death" and shared this truth with all of us.
your point of view on these matters has truly been eye-opening for me, i have a lot to learn!
the express' records show that penacony was a prison planet used by the ipc to exile criminals... at least, it was at the time of recording.
besides, ordinary computers don't have cool backstories. technology handed down from nous, huh...
katheryne, you seem frantic. what's the matter?
i'm sure you heard pieces of belobog's history the first time you visited -- the legion's invasion seven hundred years ago, how the stellaron brought about the eternal freeze...
it's a shame, though, that this pawnshop can't give me what i desire. my last attempt in penacony... well, it ends with "hope."
*sigh* you're too cautious. a gift is a gift -- it's rude not to take it!
it's a very rare ore that symbolizes a person's aspirations and dreams.
trespassers are to be eliminated at once.
well? you may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
...i am not yet an official knight, but just a maid of the knights of favonius...
i... huh. y'know, the more i think about it, the more it seems deliberate.
since you're so curious, i'll give you the whole story.
ah, i remember! the three outsiders! wait -- why are you still strolling around the city? do you know the silvermane guards are looking all over for you?
always thinking with your stomach. what about all the scenic photo opportunities?
glad to be traveling with you again, miss black swan.
you have the astral express badge on you. i saw it on the big screen once!
remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: explore, understand, establish, and connect.
there's a map in the manuscript. the markings should indicate the locations of the crystalline cores.
i understand now... when you saw that carving, you were reminded of your friend.
don't worry, march. the express never pursues conflict as a first means... but if it comes down to it, we won't back down either. that's how it's always been.
why... because you are blessed with a wonderful fluffy tail, that's why. i think it's very cute.
the doll... can speak...
c'mon, let's go talk to it and get the first treasure map.
i trust you saw this year's mingxiao lantern at the docks when you arrived at the city?
it's probably not as complicated as it sounds. it's all thanks to... a masked fool. maybe i unwittingly hurt her... and then in a flash of kaleidoscopic light, i ended up here.
well, the fact that you have a stellaron in your body is not something most people can boast about.
yes. i never observed it directly, but i used lab simulations and outbound surveys to establish a rough location.
very well, and thank you for the silk, mister kurisu.
why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
...if what oleg says is true, then svarog is an architect creation leftover from the old era.
you want a photo with him? sure! please give me your phone. i'll take it for you!
we talked to people in both the overworld and underworld. the final result was... a tie.
hehe, sorry, i'm getting too excited.
--then i'll take it gladly!
i have no particular need for luminescent spines, but i'm quite sure i can uncover a market for it with a little research.
the golden dream is getting restless. in the coming long night, i'm afraid you will face many tribulations and witness many tragedies. and finally... your sight will only see black and white.
good thing i was able to "send off" of all those summons of yours.
i see... perhaps if we were able to find miss topaz, she'd be able to give us some clues.
i'm always wary of the ipc's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. the atmosphere here is magical, i have to remind myself it's just a game.
i see, bana.
trust me, you don't want to know the cost of betraying me. just think of the things i said to you as our little secret. understood?
come on, even the chirpiest birds clock out for the night, right? i'm no different.
uh-uh-uh, it seems that you're forgetting, this is the grand narukami shrine...
traveler, paimon, sorry to keep you waiting so long.
right answer. now's our chance to get through to her. you, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
...it neither attracted their attention nor exploded... in the end, all i managed to recreate was the outward appearance...
the last couple of trailblazing expeditions have been downright terrifying... it's about time we had some fun, cozy, and cute adventures for a change!
same thoughts here. after how hard we worked to get our hands on this mora, it would be a shame to eat it all in a single sitting.
*sigh* you said you hate it when i call you "bro" in public! well i agree. it'd sound better if i started using your full name. right, broseph?
besides, there's no need to be nervous. this project is destined for success, i feel quite optimistic about it.
an astounding recitation of the ninja mantra, master kucha! i swear i will train hard until i become the dazzling ninja!
that settles it then. thanks for sticking by me throughout all this...
umm... is there anything in the tavern that has been... out of the ordinary lately?
is she being compelled by previous generations of guardians to make such baffling decisions? who knows... but this might make for good songwriting material.
calm weather? do not trust your eyes. your eyes can lie to you.
but despite our deep-rooted connection, it still took me quite a while to actually convince him.
so, c'mon! why are you looking for our good consultant? do enlighten us.
oh... i'll need to go back to the library and find out...
finally, that's all the jigsaw pieces... let's hurry back.
the carving? you mean the one i gave you?
...but that's a meaningless sacrifice, how can you--
actually, i didn't defeat master yanqing...
the meteorites harbor elemental energy, which radiates out and lulls people to sleep by some means akin to hypnosis.
actually, i've sensed a familiar feeling ever since i arrived here. it's brought some old memories to mind.
oh, well, it's all because i had an honorary knight by my side...
it's actually not new, i just never had the right occasion to try it on.
do you know anybody like that? a maroon jacket, emerald eyes, dark blue hair...
haha, that's the trailblazing life for ya.
(a pawnshop that grants wishes... is there really a place like that on this ship?)
of course. i didn't want to cause a misunderstanding, so i emphasized the title ninja hero.
after leaving inazuma, hmm... i think it would be easiest for you to go to sumeru.
that's why i've always wanted to become a real knight of favonius, to have the power to help more people!
y'know... i see you've been using the matrix of prescience to divine into kafka's past. well, i have a similar request...
huh? she's not angry? *sigh* is there anyone that isn't two steps ahead of us around here?
ugh, enough! jeez! we believe you, okay? show us the way already.
uh... well, let's leave that for now and head back to wangsheng funeral parlor. this big g matter is very closely linked to meng.
oh! there's a beautiful and touching tale about cape oath. maybe that would be a good spot?
they say it will suffice. experiencing the bizarre and motley dreamscape is the best reward.
hey, lynxy! come and have a look at this!
stop it... you want to achieve the paradise we promised, but the order is not the only choice!
uh... how do i explain... this particular piece of geomarrow is definitely not for sale...
i'm here for the watchmaker's legacy... and that's it. i think i've been honest enough.
*sigh* ...life throws all kinds of hardships at us. i doubt a single person in this world lives a truly carefree life.
great, well, now satomi can get started on that.
huh? my phone... himeko! there's something really weird happening!
...i asked amber how to make a baron bunny, and kaeya's been keeping me busy with various small tasks...
but if we wish to mount any sizable resistance against the vision hunt decree... there is still much to be done.
i see... i suppose that makes sense.
sorry, my bad... but it's not too late! you can order anything you want!
hehe, don't be nervous. just follow your heart's desire.
points for me, points for thee, this judge gives out points for free...
*sigh* anyone here surprised? anyone?
hmm... no, it doesn't seem to be here.
people's lives are at stake. why wouldn't you want another person to help? besides, i have some experience with the fragmentums. i'm sure i will be of use.
ah, looks like we found him.
i just mean where we first bumped into each other. i come up with fun names for things sometimes, okay? no need to hound me with questions about every little thing i say!
there was no need to, really... because my divinations are never wrong.
but, i don't have any experience in this area. i'm sure you're right.
too bad dan heng's not here. he's like a walking encyclopedia... he knows a ton of complicated stuff -- maybe even elevator repair...
if hoolay does come to attack the skysplitter... lieutenant yanqing, i need you to hold him there until i am able to arrive.
what if she thinks we're with the stellaron hunters? never mind the alliance, even i don't trust them...
alright then, let's bring this journey to a close!
i won't deny that rex lapis' passing seems advantageous to us. but for liyue's sake, we cannot allow ourselves to be shackled by rumors of our usurpation of power.
i'm yae miko, a light novel editor -- purely out of personal interest, and right now, what i'm most interested in is you... nice to meet you. the pleasure is all mine.
hehe, fireworks aren't just for festivals y'know.
i must be prepared for anything. if there are more formidable monsters lying in wait in this area, i must make sure i have the strength to face them.
i've also heard some things about this card snatcher you're pursuing.
sumeru's such a nice place. i'll be back for sure!
ha, not interested -- i need time, not money!
i understand your anger, and i will accept it... but this isn't the time. we should keep our eyes peeled and consider where the true enemies are hiding, and how to fight them...
hmph, i'll quote the angler again: "the field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
maybe next time. i've got something else to do now.
really now? so he's actually talented?
"what's that dolt gepard up to now? luka, you'd better fight like your life is on the line! if you lose, i'll make sure you wish you were really dead!"
yawning without covering your mouth? uncouth. i will pardon your rudeness this time. good morning to you, too.
you're right. this was meant to be a nice little get-together between friends, after all. too much formality kills the atmosphere.
(he, uh... had no choice? times are tough.)
wow... this is astonishing. is it some kind of magic? it seems to be... another copy of me?
if you don't say anything now, you may never have another chance!
"foreign object"? ...that sounds like a medical issue. will it require surgery?
i was wondering... is the train accepting new passengers?
sometimes i just put on a wig, change my makeup, and slip on a pair of glasses - just like that, i can go anywhere without a worry~
what do you mean, "be careful"? now you're making me nervous!
but what inazuma needs more than a warrior is someone like makoto.
wow! is this really a school? it looks grander than the theme park!
so once the boulders are out the way, mining can start up again?
three thousand, seven hundred years... according to our records, the adepti signed a contract with rex lapis to protect liyue three thousand, seven hundred years ago.
that's right. i often make tea for the knights of favonius, so i wanted to come here and see what i can learn.
continue on your journey and maybe that moment will come to pass.
have you concluded your articulation, sir?
i wouldn't dare "let go" and "relax." however, i am more than grateful for being able to rest here for a while.
the look on your face is practically screaming "i'm the one behind all this..."
so i'm like, "yes, i do! you held me once when i was just a baby!"
i received some intel just earlier today. someone said they found clues related to a gang of thieves in the underworld's robot settlement. i don't know if they'll lead us to the sculpture, but it's worth a try.
...just tell her already! we come from a different planet!
besides, i'm sure your dream will come true one day.
i always do my utmost to reunite each item with its owner! but the ones that go unclaimed remain at the knights of favonius headquarters.
come on, let's go back to the administrative district and hang out for a bit longer!
...but like i mentioned earlier, we're in a bit of a bind -- we could really use a helping hand.
but the fact that she's also mister sunday's younger sister... no, i doubt he'd wish harm on his own flesh and blood, no matter how grand the ambition.
as for the potential liabilities we didn't have time to discuss earlier... one good place to start might be the fungi power-up materials.
okay, that's positive. your brain seems relatively unscathed, this is good news.
no one disrespects me, no one! agh! time to show them what you get when you cross world-class genius with pure, unadulterated rage!
i had intended to read a book to pass the time, but this one was just some ridiculous diary. nothing of note in it at all.
the interastral peace corporation -- who else? the one whose insignia is pretty much everywhere? that ipc!
make sure you're properly prepared before you set off.
but there's no need to worry -- this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a stellaron. even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
you should still check the expiration date for things like rubbing alcohol. if it's expired, it won't be effective.
hello, you busy bees. and what do you have to discuss with the funeral director today?
we didn't find anything directly related to the museum thefts, but there was one thing worth noting...
ugh, aren't you supposed to be dependable?
mechanics, research, and music are all things i'm pretty good at, wouldn't you say? but i guess making money's not on the list...
it might sound ominous, but to put it simply, the hyakkiyakou is just a gathering of the youkai.
since the silvermane guards are still getting situated in the underworld and we don't have any direct evidence, we haven't been able to apprehend any suspects.
wait, could it be that the yaoqing people have some secret formula that could help me?
people of the underworld, i dare not ask for your forgiveness -- i now know the reality of your decade of suffering...
thank you so much, mister wilder! we'll cherish every moment.
not that i know how to use it, but let's see what my intuition says.
we sure showed those troublemakers who's boss! are you okay, eric?
my pops will set off the firework that i wanted to give to you.
i believe that you two will come to an understanding once your journey is over.
yes, it's windblume again, alice.
but if i give up so soon... how can i learn to overcome future obstacles?
"don't look back. keep going forward..." i get it! if i do the exact opposite -- i'll find my way out! you're a true genius, march.
don't worry, i loved it so so so much! i think this ranks as the absolute best gift i've ever been given.
so, the final conclusion is...
after we split up, ayato went to see iudex neuvillette at the palais mermonia.
but when we went to ask him about it, he had no recollection whatsoever of having written the book.
urgh, alright, alright! honestly... look at me, a genius astrologist, forced into a juvenile role-playing game...
a fitting end to the tale of the departed -- one could not ask for a better farewell. go on, they're all here.
sorry, no can do. without the slip for reference, i can't make the same one again, and i'm afraid sakujirou is the one with the slip.
now that i've benefited from your experience, i'll try to follow your instructions the next time i'm attempting optimizations on the shogun.
the owner has always been good to me, so i'd like to say a farewell before i set off.
i see, let's give it a shot! who says we have to rely purely on swordplay to beat him?
it's pretty simple: we just need to snap photos of all the markings in the victory zone -- right?
miss himeko? from the astral express? i--it's an honor -- thank you for all your help in our previous... campaign. things might have turned out differently without your support.
hmm, maybe some of your neural circuitry is less intact than i thought...
good, i look forward to your instruction.
thank you again for your assistance for the astral express. may we meet again in reality.
madam cocolia... i am grateful to you for raising me, and for allowing me the privilege of choice.
you want to know who you'll be meeting in hanamizaka? let's just say... they'll be easy to find. you'll see what i mean when you get there, hehe.
oh, and your fireworks are ready, so just go and pick them up from my house whenever you want. while you're there, you can get my pops to settle the boat construction fees.
just call me mona! stop calling me that weird name.
aha! well, at least one of you gets it!
oh no, klee doesn't seem to really appreciate this kind of praise. okay, then...
sorry, i didn't notice.
ever hear the saying "out with the old, in with the new"? well, going out with a bang is the best way to start off in style on the other side! hee-hee.
(lady bonajade? i think i've heard that name somewhere before... was it from silver wolf?)
and my phone definitely doesn't have enough storage... so, memorizing it is the most convenient way to go.
that's quite a stash! not sure if it's enough...
even though we might be familiar with the way nature looks on the surface, each type of scenery evokes a different kind of "feeling."
yeah, she and i were hanging out not that long ago. what's the matter?
training fungi... and then domesticating them?
hahaha, how'd you know we'd need this?
don't worry, paimon. the shogun's chosen envoy may be strong, but tomorrow's match doesn't prohibit the use of visions. we'll make a formidable team.
i do apologize, mister cyrus... i must get back to my exam preparation.
ah, they're coming already! facing them alone... do i have what it takes?
that wubbaboo we just saw... it seemed a little upset. i wonder what madam herta did to the poor thing?
like a drowning individual in the deep sea, when one's body and mind bear immense pressure, agony, confusion, and despair will follow. i firmly believe that...
at the intermediate stage of my journey, or chuuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. the art of the polearm -- slashes and backslashes.
may i ask... where were the missing items recovered from?
you seem like a pretty important person. what brings you to this kind of place?
i'm sure amber would be happy to see the outriders grow as a team.
moving now to our third riddle... huh? why is the handwriting so... floaty...?
thanks for the invitation, but right now, i just want to focus on practicing swordplay. masters, let's save the tea for later.
this truth remains, whether you choose to believe it or not. your sensei taught you ninjutsu so that you may step in when a mission needs you.
a mountain of yesteryear now sits as an island in the sea. almost anyone from mondstadt could reach it now, just by jumping in a boat.
me neither, if only we had a snowmobile... we never get to bring anything cool from the express.
(hey! that's not the right thing to say...)
you're a senior in dreamweaver academy? i'll be going there too! i'll be sure to ask if i have questions!
mister reca is so amazing. he convinced the family so easily.
as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "pythons slither without feet, as manta rays glide without wings."
so, how could i possibly resist it... i mean can you imagine? i can actually free myself from this icy medical cabin in this dream...
the duty of the silvermane guards is to serve the people. so, where can we find these robots? clara, can you lead the way?
ah, good show today, both of you. it was so much fun to watch.
wait a second... did you say "gnosis"?
but where did i put it...
it's waaaay too much of a coincidence. a stellaron hunter shows up at the site of a stellaron burst that just happens to be occurring nearby. does anyone really believe that?
hey, you're gonna take it!? yinshu, this isn't your fault -- you don't have to do this.
uhh... my head is spinning...
look, the ambrosial arbor's roots...
"unlikely, potential..." meaning there could still be conflicts...
hehehe... okay, i'll stop. now, a question for you. traveler, what is your ambition?
...huh? wh--what're you saying that for?
coffee... we can't really make that here...
i've left keqing in charge of the fireworks show. if you're interested, why don't we pay her a visit together?
merchants already have enough challenges to deal with, and as paimon explained, my help was unconditional. please, sell your wares to me at the price you would sell them to any other customer.
...are you done ordering? you... you have great taste! haha... i... i'll get the bill...
it's fine, she wouldn't mind. really, she wouldn't.
i didn't plan this gathering only for everyone to walk on eggshells, ai ya!
good thing the conqueror of demons and i are both as swift as the wind. and whoosh! we made it just in time!
please don't worry, mister dan heng. if someone must be held accountable, it won't fall solely on your shoulders.
i'm not sure. there don't appear to be any changes... however, the many doubts that once plagued me have dissipated.
serval, we're racing against the clock! no time for head-wrapping.
oh? y'know, it might be interesting to see you get in trouble.
just stop whining. at least you're in one piece, right?
what do you think it was about the jade chamber that defeated osial?
hehehe, let me give this "shooting fireworks straight into the skies with a bow" business a shot!
we've dealt with similar phenomena multiple times throughout the ages. each time, we successfully restore the balance between life and death.
so i introduced a lot of concepts that aren't part of traditional chess, as well as different chess pieces and even boards.
"the xianzhou luofu cordially invites jarilo-vi's warriors to join the wardance."
i stared out at the sea for goodness knows how long... i just couldn't let it go... i just couldn't.
since you're here... can we assume that you're fully aware of the situation in penacony?
by the way, did i hear you mention that clorinde used to work under you?
i've summarized my experiences from the mock exam and created a new reading list...
why? because the whole of liyue witnessed me destroying my jade chamber.
miko... the people of inazuma are afraid of me...
yes, you see things the way they are, however they may appear on the surface.
hmm, this does pose a bit of a problem. if we can't find your brother, well, we can't perform an exorcism with nothing to exorcise, can we?
you know, the night sky of teyvat is truly marvelous. all the answers in the world seem to have been hidden within.
yay, we did it! can't see the smoke anymore.
...in fact, it once belonged to me and cocolia. it was our shared treasure. if you don't mind, bronya... could i take it back to the workshop?
although, if what dan heng said is true, i doubt something that could swallow the express would be a picky eater...
unfortunate, but most entertaining.
however, since akahito's poetry collection was an important gift to be presented to the shogun, surely one of those two methods was used to protect it.
...ugh, that noise! do fragmentum monsters usually sound like this?
even after we found out about his mysterious past, he's still the same dan heng we've always known!
i never thought it'd be so luxurious...
oh yeah? huh, maybe she really liked you...
i mean, it does sound like something a masked fool might do...
we might as well just be direct and ask her where she is. she seems like the type of person who appreciates a straight approach.
right, we need to figure out how to help them. the ipc is too big and powerful -- even if bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation...
i'm noelle, a maid of the knights of favonius.
...seriously? thanking us like that, and then immediately sending us on another mission?
miss tingyun, are the long-life species on the xianzhou... all like this?
it's hard not to get a little irked thinking about it.
...memory loss, huh. you must've been injured.
do you think topaz is around here somewhere? maybe her cronies are acting without her authorization...
oh, we haven't seen serval since we got back! let's head to the workshop.
oh! it's the traveler and paimon! what brings you to this side of town?
ah, you know, young people! their rooms always reflect their personality.
the philosophy of life that he shared with us just now, that was makoto's view on reality. she always saw things that way.
it's fine, take it! c'mon, just look at its big, happy smile!
there will always be somewhere. after all, you guys are on the path of the trailblaze...
combine the adepti sigils with the wonder cores and insert them into the jade chamber's control compartment.
...but since we're already here, they could use our help.
take a look, our adventurers spend the whole day scaling mountains, clearing domains, and smiting enemies. danger and peril are their bread and butter.
if it were me... i guess i'd choose to build a cage for the little charmony dove.
the organizers have chosen the theme for today's event, and that theme is: "of earth and water born."
the family recruited many artists, architects, and scholars from across the universe to form the team of dreamweavers that built the dream of penacony.
do you see what i mean now? their attitude was just as i expected.
but through our local customs, the pioneering spirit of the firecrackers has been passed down to this very day.
alright, then i'd like to have a few more.
i also perform similar care for my sword every day, and familiarize myself with its shape and weight... to the point where it feels like a natural extension of my body.
so... let's start by going to the stormbearer mountains.
though it may take more time to garner the specifics, i can read the gist of a situation at a glance.
uh, pitch-dark hook the great, where is the fight club? can you show us the way?
yikes! so serious! i was just curious.
(i'm always logical! and based on my deduction, pretending to be an officer isn't gonna work...)
it dropped from klee's backpack, so i thought it might contain some ancient knowledge, but...
the eternal freeze is no ordinary natural disaster -- meteorological records from hundreds of years ago cannot explain the cause. to put it simply, it's a problem that has plagued belobog scientists for centuries.
this goes against the rules we set for ourselves at the start.
they were tough times. but i had a clear goal and plenty of motivation.
...mister gallagher, you even know my name?
i know, right? i'll teach them a lesson myself if i catch them in the act, that's for sure.
if i just go ahead and tell them that the great mujina youkai doesn't exist without knowing the full story, then who knows -- i may be doing more harm than good.
master yunli's old mettle is taller than a person. being able to wield a weapon like that must mean that you have ridiculous strength, right?
then, i will have answers for you, even regarding such distant and foggy matters as gods and kin.
i am currently unwilling to deal with any business. i am also incapable of it.
yeah! let's do this again -- the right way. this is boothill. you guys started off on the wrong foot. he's actually a really nice person.
the old folks aren't very mobile, so c'mon, let's help them out. we'll get rid of the weeds first and then deliver the pickled radish.
here is the pass permit. show it to the okuzumeshuu at the gate, and he will let you in.
...it doesn't matter. everyone has their own preferences.
if i were to bring my disciple to meet her, then the lead is already mine, no?
what do we do? do we fight, or run?
hmm. so even i, who seeks eternity, am constantly changing my form of existence...
the yuheng, keqing... she's quite hard to talk to. she's so uptight, hehe... really makes me wanna mess with her. she wouldn't knock me in the head with her sword though, right? or would she...?
i knew you'd be excited! check out the master of gossip over here.
sit on the chair, stare at the painting, and relax your body and mind. but try and be natural, there's really no need to be nervous.
forty%... sixty-five%... eighty-five%...
they were a tightly knit group of friends, but eventually, they all grew up and decided they each wanted to go into business themselves.
well, you bet right on that front...
so you suggest accepting aventurine's proposal to team up?
yes... that certainly sounds like a lot of trouble... although, that's not quite what i was asking about...
a blade is like a tea-leaf. only those who sample it many times can appreciate its true qualities.
jokes aside, did you see madam yukong frown at us? i thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.
sorry! if you really don't want to be examined, i still need to take care of you!
that's what the old hag said. we astrologists can't predict our own fate.
so it can only mean... that you are happy to see me again. you have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
mm-hmm, i picked the venue especially for you -- a humble local eatery called kiminami restaurant.
...but that won't come to pass. i'll do as you ask. i'll leave.
maybe the stellaron hunters were telling the truth. it seems like something really did happen to the xianzhou...
and yet, despite this, i thought it could do no harm to ask the question, on the off chance that you are interested.
why you...! hmph... since you're letting me stay here for free, i'll let that pass...
have you still not realized your situation? from the moment you appeared, you were doomed to one fate.
it would not be appropriate for me to be seen there myself.
i'm making early preparations for what is to come.
well, the underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. it seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns -- just like the outskirts of belobog.
this is your plane of euthymia. it's your inner world.
ah, good timing! there's something i need you to do.
whoa, the fort's packed... i've never seen this many people here before.
i heard mister yang was once the leader of a secret organization and saved a whole planet! not to mention he's been a teacher, and even a storyboard artist! *sigh* he must be an alien or something...
while they were preoccupied with that, sayu could infiltrate the tenryou commission and take the report, as well as any other evidence she might find...
right on! but you can say whatever you like -- a good adventure shouldn't be full of rules and regulations!
we just left there. talk about coincidence.
yep, we were outdone by a couple of kids. kind of embarrassing when you think about it...
i was gauging his reactions just now, did you see? unless we have irrefutable evidence, he won't question cocolia's orders. if you go after him now, our plan's as good as over.
when the silver sting swarm lands on a planet, it looks like glittering snow has fallen. after every battle, i look back... and see the ice-cold remains of the cavalry in the swirl of silver fragments.
(so luocha hopped on a starskiff and fled with the help of his accomplice... and that, ladies and gents, is the truth behind luocha's disappearance.)
hmph, you think i was bluffing? my full title is and always has been "mona megistus, the astrologist."
what do you mean? it's improbable that you've crossed paths with my past self... what i mean is, there is nothing left to retrace there -- only nihility.
first things first. follow me to the entrance.
hehe, if you find yourself at your wits' end, take it out and see what happens. maybe your prayers will be answered, and all your problems will disappear in the blink of an eye.
hmm... something i want to do... i already do what i want every day.
hey, wait! just think about what you're doing! and... don't mention our names if something goes wrong! ugh, i hope they don't get into trouble... this is nerve-wracking.
dah-da-da-dah, dah-da-da-dah, oh!
it's okay, there's no need to be embarrassed. the desire to cuddle up to a soft tail while sleeping is quite natural.
i finally get to meet you, honorary knight.
me? ...you think i can choose a suitable target?
goodness, i presume that the tournament is proceeding very smoothly indeed? otherwise, how would the host and sponsor themselves have the time to spare to chat with contestants one on one?
life is ephemeral, and i only wish to be a piercing arrowhead -- to be the hunt -- until my very last breath.
so it's literally a helping hand?
she's always bragging to me about it, but it's difficult for me to really imagine without seeing the place for myself. can you take me there?
peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while...
yo! baseball bat ninja. ninja ruri. ninja hiryu.
yes. plus, fischl is still nowhere to be found, and i highly suspect that she's even more eager to find the entrance than we are.
to bear witness and to defend everyone's destiny... that's exactly what i try to do.
miko invited me here to experience the fun and festivities along with everybody else.
what's with you turning into a scaredy-cat? i didn't see you worrying about lawsuits when you wrecked that giant mech.
i see that it's no boast to call them liyue's delicacies.
four commissions... hmm, m--maybe if i can squeeze out some time from my breaks...
mondstadt grilled fish... you have a point. all it needs is a fish fillet and some pepper.
wicked tongues, wicked lies, all of them destroyed, say goodbye to evil plots, strategies and ploys. the life of the party, savior of the school, let's hear it for the hero, here to keep it cool...
i don't fully understand yet. but my intuition tells me that the reason for everything... it's that seed.
you noticed it too. i was going to bring it up with you while we were preparing the food. in that case, yes, just leave it to me.
allow me to take the investigation matters from here. you needn't worry any longer.
we rescued him from the snow out of the kindness of our hearts. we had no idea he might be using us to get past you! are you really dumb enough to fall for his...
it's f--freezing here -- the blizzard's so fierce! the power from the trailblaze path isn't enough to stop the cold...
how about we start with your name? now, should we call you misha? or...
i wouldn't have made a difference. my orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but i couldn't just blow up the space station with it -- herta would not like that...
finally, if you still think you can copy the fatui's strategy of providing me with deceptive information to produce flaws in my judgment...
no, but... i do have an aching feeling in my chest.
your fangs and claws have grown dull!
i've only seen this kind of monster before in the restricted zone...
phew... good thing i let him go alone -- my calming influence would've ruined his training.
no wonder yinshu said she had to cover her nose...
what sort of person would wish to reach the summit of that mountain? and how is their desire strong enough to exert an influence on others?
hmm, i can almost guarantee that your mister yang is already on his way.
*sigh* i gotta find something fun to do... sitting around doing nothing is a fate worse than death.
hm? oh, hello traveler. and i see sayu and mister ogawa are with you. is something the matter?
let's get right to it! the first theme is... "riddle me this"!
a simple and direct method, yet more clear than any language could convey. it even allows me to verify my own existence.
but fear is not entirely bad... although i've been scared a few times, i still feel happy now.
*yawn* i drank all that tea. why am i getting sleepy?
as you wish. it's fine by me if you don't want to tell the truth.
this is the part that intrigues me -- the invite sent by the family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
keisuke, you seem to like settling things with a duel. so let's do it your way! i challenge you to a duel!
the great mujina youkai is pretty popular with the kids, so of course they're gonna get upset if someone tries to tell them it doesn't exist.
and on behalf... of myself, i'd like to extend a warm welcome to all our guests!
also, does miss topaz even approve of your so-called "support squad"?
a compliment!? continue...
...elio would always say there's only one type of destiny: the inescapable type. he can see the future, and we... likewise are aware of our "predetermined end".
to tell the truth, this lantern rite's been a busy one for me. i got xiangling to give me a few recipes and i've been trying my hand at them. since you're here, why don't you have a taste...
aw, that's so kind of you! you just made a loyal customer out of me.
actually, today's a little different. i'm not here to buy anything. i wanted to ask if you could take a look at some goods for me.
i bet that hacker kafka pals around with had a hand in it.
oh! you're back already? sooner than i expected!
stellarly brutal! you've attained the skills of a semi-emanator when it comes to reciting the ninja mantra!
i expect they still hold a grudge against me to this day.
if i had to say one thing, it would be that the decorations are a little simple. it wouldn't hurt to consider adding more... presentable articles of furniture.
it was inevitable that their business would send them all to different corners of the world, and that they'd have far less opportunity to see each other in the future.
losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
here you are talking about offering your life, and yet you are too afraid to face my blade?
steel your nerves... a ninja hero never fears!
twenty years! we can't let all that painstaking work and talent go to waste.
from a young age, my mother taught me to be forgiving and to preserve the goodwill in people's hearts... even if i am but a small glimmer of light in this world, i must try my best to shine brightly for others.
*sigh* the universal one: "please."
but if you find something to look up to and move forward with hope, then your steps will grow lighter... and if you should fall, you'll be on your feet before you know it.
oh really? i thought i was persona non grata at bubu pharmacy? you're being unusually generous today.
wow, good for you miss jingyan.
you mean, a change of location? hmm... yes, staying in the knights headquarters and in the library all the time does tend to make me feel as if i always have to be studying...
brrrr... it's freezing! and this place feels different somehow...
the starry sky in my divinations would never look as perfect as this. some stars would lose their way, and others would fall...
after all, a life with no obstacles tends to narrow the mind. people end up believing that only they are on the right path. sometimes, obstacles are more valuable than smooth sailing.
but how can i change her mind? i've tried, but she won't listen. i don't know how to get through to her...
furthermore, i had even predicted at the time that i may wish to modify the shogun's operational rules at some point in the future. however, such changes would not be conducive to eternity.
i had no idea what to say, i didn't know if i should object or just follow along...
i shall not go back on my word. i have committed to giving it to you, what you choose to do with it is your business. you are quite free to give it to somebody else, if you wish.
so, have you thought things through?
as long as i'm polite and respectful and don't cause a fuss, they won't look to cause trouble for me, either.
i have read in a book before that mondstadt and liyue each have their own, unique tea cultures.
my friend once said to me that only people with a strong will and a clear purpose decide to go traveling. maybe it's to see a certain view or to fulfill a certain wish...
phew, i was worried things were gonna get ugly again. a peaceful solution is always the best solution.
so you heard my announcement, did you? what do you think? interested?
never-changing eternity is the promise i made to my people.
don't you have something cool to say, like "appearances can be deceiving"?
to have you do such strenuous work yourself... i should have come to your aid earlier. i have neglected my duty as a maid.
run around all you like during the day, but you should be careful during the night. when i'm not around, best keep your wits about you.
hahaha, well then, last but not least, let's say our good-byes to big g.
ah, i must say, i would relish the opportunity to watch the fatui getting a taste of their own medicine...
master jean's time should be spent on more important things.
opportunities like this don't come around every day, so i hope you enjoy it. after all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges -- relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.
left? already? left mondstadt...?
if the next stage of the investigation is successful, we should be able to open up the industrial hall to the public.
huh? i wonder why? when we split up, she said she was heading home.
it's soulglad! but i thought they didn't sell soulglad at the bar?
faced with a calamity of such magnitude, we have agreed to put our differences aside for now and unite against this common enemy.
many people dread the sound of thunder... to me, it sounds fondly familiar.
well, here's the thing. even if skott apologizes, do you think he'd actually feel sorry for what he did?
the blizzards here are brutal. if we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, belobog would long since have become a dead city -- both above and below the surface.
so... when's the aurora due...?
mister alfalfa and i discussed it. i'll present a gift to the astral express on behalf of the family as a token of gratitude for the nameless' contributions to penacony.
don't tell me... you two were placing bets on us?
do all you can to suppress them and fence them in!
everyone falls asleep here equally, regardless of our different agendas...
why, yes -- it was charlotte! i assume you've heard of her, no? that daredevil journalist?
we have to stop this breeze from growing. even if the ninja initiates decide to make the leap, it should be a conscious choice of their own, and not sorcery that coerced them into it.
but since we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing, he deserves the benefit of the doubt.
...whoa, looks like the battle here was intense...
come now, there's no need to stand on ceremony. loosen up a little.
i'll be honest -- i'd never had coffee before.
hehe, you've only got yourself to blame thoma... all those strange things you ate were ingredients you added yourself.
not at all. you don't have to worry so much about how to compete with that book. all you have to do is provide some interesting ideas based on your travel experiences.
welt, how about a drink first? penacony's soulglad is very famous.
recently, her highness invited me to try her signature cold cut platter... sorry, i mean die heilige sinfonie!
let me do a quick count... one, two, three, four... great, equal numbers on both sides.
but maybe we're missing something? it can't be that easy. after all, it's a riddle from liyue... what would their equivalent of the dandelion be? if there even is one...
are you still under their spell? or has the ninja power of my righteous chop dissipated? fear not, i can do it again!
the portion of what i pay that exceeds the average price of luminescent spines in the past, you will need to pay back to me by some means in our future business dealings.
but... time is precious... if i rest...
as for the akademiya... let's go once i get myself a set of sumeru-style clothes.
...i understand, but the sound of the shutter and the camera bulb might send it into a frenzy...
and what about you guys? take your time, we're not in a rush.
don't worry, i haven't forgotten. i will be sure to remind the tenryou and yashiro commissions of their duties in this regard.
ugh, can't we run around to them for a change!?
don't forget to return to the parlor later. there's something i need you to do!
since you're curious, why not go and talk to the buyers? i'm sure they'll give you the answers you're looking for.
defense or offense, we need to pick one and go all in.
ahhhh... well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the underworld, we can finally look for the stellaron.
i heard that your great-grandfather was very industrious when he was young. but later in life, he no longer bothered with the forging arts. it appears that his failure took quite a toll on him.
there are also stores that sell luxury goods, apparel, trendy toys, and even cars... as long as you have enough alfalfa coins, you can buy anything you fancy.
you can't call it divination if you reject anything bad and believe the good unreservedly. that's just self-deception.
alright. then i'll get to the crux of the matter.
and lo and behold, when the dice came to rest, i counted precisely six of the pyro persuasion! it was all over before i could say, "pyre, pyre, pants on fire!"
she left us a letter. hmm... could this be one of those "open-in-case-of-emergency" letters? i've never gotten one of those before. should we wait until we run into something dangerous?
hahaha... uh, -- it's mainly just that i, uh... can't always comprehend the... lofty ideals and, uh... principles you discuss...
well? the things you wanted to see, but also wished not to see, are here before you.
so if you drink this, you can suddenly sing like an angel?
oh, you're right! i almost got all excited for nothing.
hmm, i want to reserve some of your spare time. let's go on a vacation together.
if all the characters in the animation are based on characters in reality, then clockie's counterpart is definitely the watchmaker.
it's just a guess, but there are also some footprints on the ground here.
well... i do think there's something fishy with this tv.
turn back around... ninja heroes never retreat!
i'm so full... guess now we just wait for the light show.
i agree with you, black swan. that's why the most critical aspect of this plan is not to convince everyone to choose the right path...
establish a connection with the new world -- rejoice with it and share in its fears.
given your position and that of the international trade association... please try to exercise more caution in the future. you do not want to incur further unnecessary losses.
n--no! ...nothing! this book... it's too early to read this book...
it's called liyue millennial. based on classic chess, but with different rules.
that's why you have to develop your talent pool -- otherwise everything falls apart when you go on vacation...
remember, you two also need to take care of yourselves! i'll be back soon.
...that's great! a young cute girl full of energy living her best life on campus? that experience is practically made for me!
take it from someone on the other side of your so-called river: you know better than i do that penacony has already deviated from the harmony. whatever your intentions may be... i foresee only one outcome.
a projection of real-world fate, to form an image of reality...
i did a quick scry when i came into this world, and when i saw the stars' reflections, i was at a loss for words... it looks like fate in simulanka is directly based on teyvat.
alright. well, i'll leave the decision to you.
okay, thanks! if you find out anything, don't forget to tell the people with the green scarves!
yeah, the first time i heard about it, i knew straight away that it was probably something the parents had come up with to stop the kids from running off all the time.
wait, are you saying my swordplay still isn't good enough?
hmm, there seems to be quite a market for this... ahem, never mind. let's get ready, and start the game.
ugh, why do i get the feeling we're not the ones doing the hunting?
true heroes in immersia don't merely settle for "satisfying!"
can i drink half now and save the other half for later? just in case skott beats me, i can use it to recover...
good. and as agreed, please use top-grade materials only.
i've seen many clever disguises that can conceal appearances, but they can never cover up who a person really is. and you're no different.
let me get some aideen tokens for you. with those, you'll be able to try any of the attractions here that you fancy.
uh... you're not talking about the memory zone meme, are you...
it is my pleasure to announce that the winner of the masterful chefs finals is:
wow... so this is what happens when i try to go with the flow...
that's true, but this... really doesn't seem fresh...
that might sound silly to you... like, why do you have to be happy just because it is?
for mortals, even if they possess the great power of a path, they can't create a flawless world like gods do.
if i want to become a real knight soon, i have to continue to put in more effort than the others.
i'll definitely be putting in a few words next time we meet yukong...
so today, i won't tend to any of that other nonsense. i'll just hang out here.
hmm... i'm a little worried that quinn might just throw a wood carving in a drawer and forget about it...
my guess is that it's because we had communications with many worlds before the eternal freeze. luka, have you heard of the story of igor haft?
...and perhaps the grownups among us could remain silent? this is a children's program...
...at least he won't be getting in our way again. let's go find that gallagher and ask him the intricacies of the case.
oh... how studious of you.
well... if you're okay, let's move on to the next stop, which is just a stone's throw away from here. please follow me...
pom-pom can't just leave the express whenever they feel like it. you didn't know?
i think welt's anxious that he can't keep up with you youngsters, but he sure seems young at heart to me...
ohh, he's gone... i do hope there are no further misunderstandings today.
the engine of creation... sadly, i never got the chance to see the robot myself.
clara, we'll help you investigate what's going on with the robots.
as long as the core content is interesting, my expert team here will be able to flesh out the details.
one down already! we're on fire!
now they are towering obstacles that i have no choice but to overcome.
please, enjoy. after all, it's your first meal here as a new visitor, and your last. i wouldn't want to give you the cold shoulder.
a chance combination. hmm, interesting. may i try this drink?
it's the place in the photo alright. is this... a games parlor!? what kind of problem can they possibly be facing?
hmm? it does? well, doesn't ring any bells to me.
there is no way... i can't believe it...
we found it! this must be miss marjorie's missing monocle.
n--no thanks! i'm heading to the opening ceremony of the dreamlight anniversary!
i've heard that the peddlers often close up shop earlier on the last day because there are fewer people around.
...if we couldn't hold our defensive line, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our supply of aid to the underground, which would have collapsed without us. that was the supreme guardian's explanation.
yes, but not entirely.
looks like march has fallen in love with the way of the nameless. that's good to hear.
but wangsheng funeral parlor awaits your distinguished patronage.
"sam" something, "kos" something... i can't read the rest, but it seems like a name.
care for a game of liyue millennial? it'll give me an opportunity to see exactly how good you are as a player.
thank you! as appreciation, i'd like to give you a token gift.
hehe, it's alright, it was worth it!
it is my hope that with this information, you will be better equipped as the supreme guardian to make a wise and informed decision.
i still have other business to attend to at the jade chamber. i'll leave keqing in your capable hands.
it radiates dazzling light perpetually, just like this glamorous dream.
learning from experience, writing diaries... it seems like adventuring requires constant self-reflection, just like studying.
hearing you speak, it sounds as if your voice has made somewhat of a recovery.
hehe. i just wanted my things back. hardly an unusual sentiment.
i have seen and learned a lot during our time together.
i--i'm so sorry! i heard that the conductor was extremely adorable, but i never expected... hope they're not angry.
the work of the astrologer is to show people what fate has in store for them, and that's exactly what i do. there will always be those, however, who are unable to accept what they are told.
*ahem* i mean, they certainly seem to suit my taste.
and all of this was caused by the meteor shower... this i was not expecting.
please, i am march seventh, a swordmaster who will represent the luofu in glorious battle!
ooh! i think i see it! oh, uh... it was pretty obvious.
even though the protagonist refuses to acknowledge his innate talents, he has a rare dedication to justice.
...which means the fragmentum has already taken root by this point. even though the stellaron is sealed, we won't be able to reverse the damage immediately...
here we are. this is the place.
where's your sense of loyalty!? uh, that would be nice though...
who is it? shop's closed today, you'll have to come back tomorrow!
so you'll have to come up with something new for the next chapter of "the miraculous adventures of the traveler."
huh? arlan wanted to go on assignments just to experience stress!?
serval, this dunn, do you know him?
however, even the sweet dream has its limitations. while it provides solace to the disillusioned, it can't completely eliminate pain in reality.
but please believe me that in that monochrome world, there will be a glimpse of fleeting red, and when you make a choice, it will reappear before you once more...
the matrix of prescience has amazing powers, and can iterate and reiterate kafka's past... so it got me thinking -- if i turned the matrix on me, could it calculate my past?
look over there, the windrise tree! symbol of the great hero, vennessa!
yeah, farewell, everyone. may your trailblazing expedition never end.
your determination is admirable! ninja initiate gigaku, you have already stepped into the ninja hero domain.
here we go again, back to our old stomping grounds for another adventure!
let me answer that with a question. you claim that you were willing to pay a high price because you trusted me. but is that really the full story?
i used to think just like that samurai... that i was first and foremost a warrior, and my only duty was to face whatever challenge came my way.
hehe. gorou, now do you understand how appealing your tail is?
being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, march. since we've been invited, it's only right for the astral express to attend the ceremony.
goodness. this reminds me of fishing... not an easy catch.
much as i expected. the insufferable research maniac has exposed his true colors to our two protagonists... you seem to be edging ever closer to the truth.
but if i just marched straight in there by myself, i'd probably get miss kamisato in a whole heap of trouble, hehe...
hehe! look what we have here! isn't this the fan we're looking for?
it's okay, clara! we're here to reason with him.
hey, i was seriously worried when you didn't respond. thank goodness. the order's dream is over.
what should we do? this is going from bad to worse!
of course that wouldn't work. neither do i have any intentions of pushing ninja initiates to adopt the way of the dazzling ninja.
the right to punish inazumans for their crimes is mine alone. not yours, signora.
besides, we both know you wouldn't be here at the grand narukami shrine unless you had a request for me, too. this is an opportunity to demonstrate that you come in good faith.
does that mean... there's a god connected to these dream-like mirages, and the fatui found a way to research it?
heh, i suppose this is one blessing from the adepti that we should be thankful for.
no, no no. aiya, you're no common tourist. i simply won't have you talk about yourself that way.
but when he heard that, he said "mister dan heng was right."
and the whistle you heard was the sound of the express arriving at penacony?
exactly, this is where you and firefly encountered "death", which we now know as "dormancy". considering its connection to dreamflux reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
let's talk about this later when you're back on the express. you and march must be tired after such an incredible journey -- it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
... i'm sorry, jiaoqiu. i didn't expect you to use poison that way. what a miscalculation. if only i'd found you sooner... if only i hadn't sent you to the shackling prison...
we'll probably end up running into more of norbert's goons up ahead.
i'm still worried about the owner. let's go check on her.
i can't shake the feeling that we missed something today. maybe i'm just overthinking...
i think it should be your choice, and yours alone.
your present will is not the product of erosion. i shall no longer stop you from attempting to modify the rules.
okay, "a pawnshop that grants wishes"... i see. it's just a marketing gimmick.
so what happened back there? why did the supreme guardian send people to arrest us?
well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, hehe...
as i am sure you already know, everything on this land accumulates history and value as time passes. that is the nature of liyue.
if -- and i mean if -- we can truly find a way to uproot the fragmentum's corruption, then maybe we can stem the silvermane guards' losses...
that's true. and that's why i'm also here for another purpose -- to visit hoolay.
hehe, i'll try my best. in the future, i'll get some extra materials in to cover any unexpected changes of plan late in the day.
with me present, they are unlikely to blame you even if we do happen to interrupt the negotiations.
traveler, paimon... what do you think?
what... kind of knight? i--i always thought that just qualifying to be a knight was challenging enough to begin with...
nice, it's sweet. the sensation is not so different from eating a dessert. a unique beverage indeed.
for now, some practical advice will do!
this may sound embarrassing, because i would sometimes forget stuff i really shouldn't have from past experiences... it's just a habit of mine, don't mind me.
of course i understand! all cute things in the world share a special connection, after all.
i'm sorry, i invited you to come and watch the fireworks, but now i have to run a few errands.
these records remind me of something my mother once said to me -- "can civilizations built by humans really stand against the will of gods?"
i'll just have to stay in mondstadt temporarily. once that old crone's reached the end of her days, i'll be free.
why does this place feel so bleak? ...xinyan, are you sure this is your mirage?
also, i want to go and ask everyone what they thought of the fireworks.
descendant of the kujou clan. your turn.
it seems... i still have lots to learn...
there should be another pool around here for us to enter.
wild grass, berries, butterflies, a cool breeze... when i want fresh air, i like to go out where the plants grow wild and touch the life-filled world with my own hands.
...yes, every celebration must come to an end.
sorry... inazuma's pretty far, so maybe some key information got lost across the ocean.
great minds think alike, hmm? i wonder, does that qualify me to, maybe, take the position of shogun for a couple of days?
if all i wanted to do was make some quick mora by exploiting their blind faith in me, i have a million more effective ways of achieving that than hosting an auction.
what you make of my words is up to you. i do hope that most of it flew over your heads, though. the wangsheng funeral parlor is just that, a funeral parlor. nothing more to it.
--they are not scum!
yep, pom-pom has a deep connection with the astral express. anything that could harm the express always stresses out the conductor.
oh... you mean, studying isn't the only preparation i should be doing?
see, it's like i said: if you wake up and dan heng's not around, then you probably won't see him the rest of the day either.
what's wrong with that? we've got ten fingers, may as well use them!
no, something else. all the talk around luminescent spines is just empty hype.
what would i know of the adepti? ai-yai-yai, that kind of stuff is top-secret! don't come asking me about it!
it'll give you a chance to figure out her moves in advance and come up with a counter strategy. that should be a big help, don't you think?
i think that this is beneficial to them.
i'll convene the qlipoth fort architects immediately to discuss the contract. as for the locals, i'd like you to gauge their stance on the matter.
i imagine this must have taken baishi completely by surprise.
yeah, he's gone... wait a sec, who're you!?
you're a fiendling who only knows how to take orders from the evil ninja and go around causing trouble. what right do you have to judge me?
*sigh* another locked gate. time for the old dilemma -- break in or climb over?
because skill doesn't thrill unless you've also got style!
okay, then let's head back to mondstadt and see if anyone needs help!
i believe that as time goes by, this firework will only grow brighter and more beautiful in your heart.
huh, i think i'm getting rather good at this...
i am honored to have the opportunity to exchange techniques with you.
even though i initially wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about you...
back already? you've met with jing yuan and wandered around for a few hours. so, what do you think?
what i saw surprised me... a good number of the architects in belobog believe that qlipoth is the one and only aeon... it's clear that their conclusion was limited and lacking in perspective.
kamai and the samurai's parting was one of the first things she experienced when she was partially sentient and didn't have her human form yet.
he doesn't have to be so melodramatic, does he?
whatever their reasons might be, if our customers come to us looking for help, we're not about to leave them high and dry.
bam, and it comes out just like that. no matter how many times i've seen it, it still looks magical.
...i must have been... negligent in some way... did i leave him with a bad impression of mondstadt...?
that's right. i am the astrologist who has plumbed the depths of the ocean of stars. surely, you have long calculated my arrival as well.
to sum it up, we are "gatekeepers," guarding the border for the sake of both the living and the dead, hehe.
well, you can find all kinds of local delicacies here -- clockie pizza, oak cake rolls, alfalfa salad, and the classic soulglad! feel free to pick anything you like! today it's my treat!
no, the prototype was merely a proof of concept. its appearance and intellect were not based on ei. it was a test.
thank you, knight of beauty! we don't have much time left... may we meet again.
no one knows more about ore than a blacksmith!
this room... why is it upside down?
is chevreuse... still not joining us today?
alright, seems like we've wrapped up everything here. come on, off we go.
so... what about if i join you instead!?
ah, i see. so in other words, i need to do some sort of visually agreeable action in front of you, right?
yeah! that starskiff was pretty cool, there must be loads of interesting things in exalting sanctum.
after that, he hardly saw them. but whenever one of them did come back to visit, fireworks would always be involved.
leave? but now that mother is gone... where can we even go?
but as for evil spirits, i think you're scaring yourself. even i have only encountered malevolent forces a handful of times.
i imagine that an item as delicious as this dango milk must sell exceptionally well, no?
huh? oh, i... i was just thinking aloud. don't worry about it.
of course, becoming the dazzling ninja is my way of the ninja.
anyway. now that i have been defeated by you and your plan, i will honor your wish to abolish the vision hunt decree.
well, if i were leonard, i would want to make sure the core lands right on the snowy summit that i never made it to while i was alive.
infernal construction what now? how would we know anything about that!
luocha turns a corner, but the corner leads straight to an inn... then he exits the inn and goes into spare time book shop without buying anything.
(this is luocha's trick -- feign weakness to get the gatekeeper to lower his guard.)
should i take this to mean that you doubt the relative safety of leaving this in the hands of the tianquan?
matsuzaka and the others are still waiting for me so we can go hunt down the great mujina youkai. i'm like a big sister to them, so i can't go back on my word.
hunting is not a game, it is a battle of life and death. are you ready for your death, abomination!?
take this wooden toy, for example. the wood is good quality. if you took it apart, there is quite a number of useful everyday objects that you could turn it into with a little work...
*yawn* well, here we are. i feel sleepy already.
i always feel at ease when you're by my side. ah, but of course, please don't let me get in the way if you wish to participate with someone else...
what do you mean, "strange"? it took a lot of work by a lot of different people to get this thing finished. don't you think it's a very descriptive pen name?
is that the jade gate? it's huge!
i understand. the more that weighs on your mind, the more your fears become dreamscapes.
"...since you've already noticed, i guess i can let you lend a hand."
oh, you haven't heard? "lesser lord kusanali" is the deity in whom the people of sumeru place their faith. it's their chosen term of endearment for her.
yeah... you could be right about that. is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
come on, let's go back and see the children.
that's the belief of the architects... but for us, hell is an endless fragmentum, a few exhausted silvermane guards... and the stench of death in the air.
"the camaraderie and solidarity of its members form the backbone of the knights of favonius..."
think of it as a catalyst that can reproduce the raiden shogun's combat moves. i made it from my own memory, which means it should be perfectly accurate -- unless of course, her skills have declined.
ooh... so many options. i'm seeing stars already.
ugh... you're so annoying...
so... so this is the kind of food you like? after i get back, i will have to study it properly...
back to the question: i would personally choose to build the little charmony dove a cage.
yeah! see, the two of us would never have misunderstandings like this.
we are looking for the most distinguished guest here. as the host, i shouldn't be involved in this discussion at all!
i thought you should know all this before making a choice. goodbye.
i'll go play with gorou, instead. it's been a while since i've seen those fuzzy ears of his.
me? i'm fine. as soon as i saw all these people gathered here, i suddenly felt weirdly relaxed.
i'm not a local, and there's a reason why the bloodhound family is after me... i also have my own purpose for joining you on your journey...
no problem! leave it to me!
well, this is a dramatic change, unique in all of the millennia of liyue's history. everyone is eager to do their part and make their mark in the age of humanity.
steak? good point! in a real emergency, all you'd need is a piece of meat... you wouldn't even need any seasoning.
um... i want to learn about the liyue diet. adjusting the dish to accommodate what i'm used to seems to defeat the purpose of coming here...
and i finally got wind of your movements when you were on the way to wangshu inn.
yes, and once we're done, we will find a merchant to give us an appraisal of their value.
i hope that it might be a highlight of your journey. if you ever grow weary in your travels, know that you can always come back and visit liyue.
ugh... it was too far up in the air, i couldn't get to it...
message not sent? why not?
the cocolia i knew would sit on the roof and listen to my songs, but... not the supreme guardian.
well then, it's time you felt the power of "mechanical fever!" pela, let's show them what we're made of!
well, technically there aren't any seats... but anyways!
my pleasure! here, give me your phone.
little layla here breezed through her first battle, souka won hers by a hair's breadth... but mine was rather disappointing. my opponent was a frightful bore.
you really care a lot about your family, tartaglia...
what exactly is he... talking about?
it just means you'll tell me all the details. no hiding anything, and no telling fibs.
but why did she have to mention that i broke the synthesizer...
thanks for your help, miss fu xuan...
something's off. these traces are fresh. someone just left the scene... would this person have anything to do with what happened just now?
ugh, how can you call me a weirdo? i mean, wouldn't you say it's more... charmingly naive? or... disarmingly different?
okay, thank you, arnold.
...not hand over our fate to this seed of ruin!
y'know, you sound sweet enough, but you were talking about getting us escorted away by your cloud knights. if it weren't for mister yang...
hehe, don't worry, i know. i think they're very cute, and i'm happy to protect them.
yes, i think i might ask souka to ditch her original characters and just make you the protagonists in her next novel.
so, if i were to take on that ipc guy now, what would you say are my chances?
...dan heng got on the train before me. he never mentioned his past... if you get the chance, why don't you ask him about it?
hehe, i'm glad we're able to discuss some lighter topics.
from the campus group chat, of course. i joined the group before school even started so i'd get to know more people. that's just common sense.
as it stands, the votes are even. your opinion will make all the difference.
haha, let's go then. first, we need to think of a way to get to the other side.
sounds like a wonderful life -- i'm sure many have dreams of that.
there's something i want to discuss with you.
however, try as i might, i could never forget that incident.
well, that's that then. let's head back to the jade chamber.
thank you all for being here today at the masterful chefs finals. i am the tianquan, ningguang.
i can't remember the last time i went for a walk like this. i never thought i'd take one through such a strange place, with someone i'd only just gotten to know.
sadly, the past has all but vanished. but seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
hehe, you could say that... we were like sisters once -- inseparable. of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian...
then... what's going to happen to miss robin? she and sunday won't be able to deny their involvement in the charmony festival, they're siblings after all...
"the immortal spoiler"? ugh, some people just wanna watch the world burn.
meng's already crossed the "border," that's the only way to send big g off.
what is it that you hold so dear that is making you so persistent...? no, don't tell me. give me more time to understand you myself.
i felt like i was neglecting you guys, so i wanted to find an opportunity to catch up.
it seems that perhaps now, you can appreciate my feelings on all of this. in which case... perhaps you would be willing to reconsider your stance?
ever since then, i've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. i'm hoping that one day, i can find my past...
the time has to come to make a decision... this chaos cannot be allowed to continue any longer.
tomorrow we'll set out for the final stop -- the great mine victory zone. the championship is so close, i can almost feel it!
okay, leave it to me! i'm ready.
fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. to resist the invasion, the architects had no choice but to redeploy the guards to the front line.
don't worry, it might look like my mind's on other things, but i'm still listening!
the warehouse is right over here... i moved the fireworks there in advance, so it shouldn't be too much work bringing them back.
there are thirty-two versions of my full name circulating among the troops. how do i know? i'm an intelligence officer after all.
vision... vision...? oh, this thing? yeah, whatever...
but if you're seriously still insisting on turning a profit under these circumstances, i'm afraid you're beyond redemption.
um, is that the person up ahead?
being able to enjoy tea with my closest confidant -- it feels like i'm in a dream...
oh, pela and hook are here too? let's make sure we get them in the background!
hey, who's bragging? anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary ipc workers. surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than aventurine, do you?
d--don't worry lynxy! i'm sure you'll get concrete proof one day...
it requires one to take their sword firmly in both hands and cut down the hopes and dreams of others... even those of one's closest companions.
it was an emergency, so i never had the chance to formally apologize to you, and admittedly, i was the one to blame.
the fount of knowledge and boldness of spirit that your travels have bequeathed upon you are sure to imbue your policies with rare and valuable foresight.
is it that you find playing chess an uninteresting activity, or that you're unhappy about my lack of novel ideas?
looks like nothing can be found here.
i'm sorry... if only i could have passed the selection exam earlier...
...might i remind you that i am not here to amuse myself.
...i think i offended someone again.
it's just a minor error. this kind of thing was bound to happen. a small modification to the shogun should fix it.
kujou kamaji is wounded. descendants of the takatsukasa clan, it is your responsibility to take care of him.
...and on top of that, the kind of medicine practiced in the chenyu vale tradition goes against the natural order of things.
seems like a lot has changed during my absence. what exactly happened?
i'm in full support of her view -- prophecies are very important, but how can people allow their lives to be commandeered by just a few words?
it's precisely because we're friends that we should spar often and learn from each other.
a disciple should act like one. how can they steal their master's thunder?
to be brutally honest, "we took out a loan and made a speculative investment" is not a sob story.
great to hear! since the stellaron crisis subsided, belobog's been feeling a little more cheerful. we're really grateful for your assistance...
and... if i win?
that's right. did you hear that? repeat after me: dream-- flux-- reef.
it's okay, don't be upset. actually, i brought you a little something to cheer you up. how about that, hmm?
i do believe it's the finest estate i've ever seen!
oh, did i mention? ei saw that convocation ritual we performed over the grand narukami shrine.
hehe, it's funny how he tries to act all mature, but whenever it comes to something he's interested in, you can really see his childish side.
can i do anything for you? i'm at your service.
compared to mondstadt, there is far too little here for a maid to do.
but if you ask me, everyone's being a little too conventional so far. let's push the envelope a little! go nuts!
broken into pieces, and not a single soul around... this must be the way things ended.
i want to go with you, i do! i always wanted to catch a glimpse of the stellaron with my own eyes, and now it's so close...
although i don't think anyone will have any objections.
i'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. i, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. i'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
i'm going to head back and make some preparations. meet me outside the yae publishing house.
something i never have time for...
...before i left, destiny's slave told me that this journey would bring unforgettable rewards. even though the script he gave me only had a few lines, i couldn't ignore them.
don't mind me. it's just a habit. owing to events in the past, i've become easily... forgetful. it's only when this sword is unsheathed that those hazy memories start to become clearer.
i can't believe how close it is to the city center...
i will use my blade to confirm whether you are out of practice or not.
most of you were not aware of their arrival... but it is thanks to them that our world now flourishes with hope.
because of the difficult situation we were in, we formed a temporary alliance to help the residents of the underworld resolve a few... issues of survival.
the father of penacony, mikhail char legwork, one of the legendary nameless who laid the foundations of penacony!
now, i finally understand why he can't decide what to do.
i never thought you'd be such a bore. never mind! if you stick by me, everything will become clear.
huh, i just found this in my pocket... how did it get there?
an entity formed with strong filth would be highly aggressive. but when purified, it presents in the form of a memory.
however, it's all thanks to him that the dreamlight anniversary is going ahead once again. i hope that we can finally have some fun this time!
now, we also know that every aspect of the vision hunt decree's promulgation and execution has been enthusiastically spearheaded by the tenryou commission from the outset.
huh? strange, i remember no such thing.
defeating signora head-on in a duel means that your strength exceeds my expectations.
you have to experience enough to know if you've gained or lost anything because of the stellaron, and to know who you really are... learn to control the stellaron and then you can control your destiny.
...ha? what does that mean?
if we were sticklers about truth and fiction, we would've missed out on so much beauty and emotion.
don't worry, i have made preparations. the wound dressings are ready and the millelith have set up an ambush.
hey, relax! i've seen plenty of stellarons -- it'll be fine.
everyone believes that there are some missions that only you can accomplish.
it is the cradle of my vitality, and the meaning of my birth. and for the longest time, it was... how i should have looked to the rest of the world.
resting... for the sake of training...
relax, pom-pom and i are here to take care of the train.
my keyboard guy is pretty good, but i still miss our military days playing in the band...
but even so, i still hope for -- and believe in -- miracles. astrology is eternal and rational, but fate may not be. it is cruel... but it can also be beautiful.
oh no, my ninja power is dwindling.
uh... whoops, guess we were getting a little too carried away there. well, i'll go tend to my own business now. if i receive any news, i'll be sure to come find you two again!
himeko showed me her masterpiece. i gotta say: soooo cool! it was hard to resist the urge to open it up and see what was inside, but i managed to control myself...
a duty-bound soldier and a resistance leader... it's hard to be rock 'n' roll in front of people like that.
*sigh* looks like i'll have to do it by myself this time.
don't you remember what mister giovanni said? this player beat the last reigning champion -- it can't be her...
mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. and, after he left, it became three.
just me? why can't we just talk here...?
huh, so is this game already popular in belobog?
s--sorry, master diviner!
you can go and... have a look around?
i'm alright, don't worry! everything worked out eventually. let's wait for the rest of them to get back...
yes, i know... it was on purpose, wasn't it?
of course, everyone that takes part in the creative process will be paid.
"you should not get confused. if you should become confused one day, not even astrology will be able to help you then."
whoa... so this is an aranara...
easy now, layla. all that's left for us to do now is to watch and wait. the bond of companionship is not something so easily severed by the designs or devices of humans.
or... we could go check out some other fun stuff elsewhere. your call!
let's talk about the slumbernana association. there's an important seminar scheduled for today, right? are we in time for that?
besides, my problem with him wasn't that he was a strict father...
she hesitantly looked back and forth between me and her old fox friend.
"we have decided to make you confess all your crimes in person. the time for change is now, your twisted desires will be stripped away by us."
i suppose that might be why we always seem to meet by coincidence.
you must find a way to recreate the circumstances of that day.
oh, how strange -- me too! ...i'm joking, of course -- i slept like a baby. sorry to disappoint you.
looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
hahaha, sorry 'bout that, mister morris! it's probably because i'm used to carrying fireworks all the time, so it doesn't feel like a lot of work to me.
after all, leaving it there, it's bound to get hurt by wild animals or something... and that'd just be too sad.
i don't think anyone realized, but back then we were so close we didn't even differentiate between each other's possessions. we shared pretty much everything.
...i see. looks like someone is getting the miners involved in the stealing after all.
you guys actually experienced something so exciting... seriously, bring me along on such adventures next time!
you've tried in the past to prove to me that there is a connection between the sacred sakura and makoto's consciousness. but unfortunately, you never did persuade me, did you?
gotcha! see, that's what you get for annoying me!
hmm-hmm, oh, you just wait. the next time you dine at my home, i'm sure you will be pleasantly surprised!
it's just that dried valberries are not very suitable for making dye. i'll need to get some fresh ones from the stormbearer mountains.
at most, a little childish, perhaps. which is another reason why i didn't tell anybody about my plan.
she is a top xianzhou leader... mister yang, do you think this could be belobog all over again...?
if it were me, i'd just leave him be for a couple of days. he'll recover on his own soon enough.
you're back at last. the wait was exceedingly dull.
in the years that followed, i followed the trail of that light alongside my cloud knight allies, and saw it fall countless more times.
...hehe, there's no one else here, pela -- no need for such formality.
anyway, people seem to be behaving in a very orderly fashion. i don't see the liveliness you spoke of anywhere.
you could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. if you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
because i trust you! even if my masters have doubts, they'll trust your judgment!
they've scampered off in different directions. those fiendlings are up to no good. we'd better get moving.
ahem. yes. of course. still... the owner's business has had it pretty hard. it must be a truly extraordinary ring, to be worth spending this much mora to find.
let's go! one more round in the administrative district!
...if my meager strength is required.
you need to choose your words carefully if you want to persuade him of something. it might be best if i talk to him... though i'd need a strategy first.
those stellaron hunters... they even factored penacony into their plan! nowhere's safe from them!
but i am mona, progenitor of the future of astrology. nothing can stand in my way.
of course i want to live on, but... what fate owes me, i want it paid back, not passed on. no one else should be involved, because this is a grudge between me and fate.
need to take stock? just say the word -- we'll head over together.
the information about robin, firefly... and the other victims... i don't see any commonalities among them.
cat got your tongue? it's fine, he seems like a good guy. hi, argenti! i'm march seventh.
wangsheng funeral parlor, wuwang hill, funeral... what more is there to say? these three belong in the same sentence.
what an unconventional way of playing your cards... i'm impressed.
not right now, since this meteor shower was originally something like a family legend.
we're here to gather everyone's opinion on the matter. i know this is a little sudden, but we're running out of time. what's your take?
...ah, you mean the little girl in red? i remember her -- i saw her in the overworld at lady bronya's succession ceremony.
this time we're playing the role of a real detective... but before we start, what are we going to say to the family and aventurine?
seems the devs forgot to include a surrender option...
and they even called us names... they said we were...
you recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." for most of the residents here, especially those in the underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
miss furina is now one of my esteemed clients!
cease your pretensions, bandit.
if such a thing happens, i'll settle it myself!
all we need to do is bring those disillusioned fans back to their senses to quell the rogue waves of fiendlings.
i wish it were made up... unfortunately it's all true.
so how about it? will you join me?
thank you. it's a lot to handle, but i'm sure you can manage.
and last but not least, i will answer the final part of the prophecy.
ei seeks eternity. to her, mortal lives come and go in the blink of an eye. of what consequence to her are mortal concerns for her wellbeing?
there is no other option... i must act with haste -- the ceremony is about to begin. i will not abandon thoma like this.
but every encounter i've had since coming aboard the express has been strange to say the least.
...i have no idea what you're talking about.
hmm... yes and no.
this was a reunion of sorts, but there's no time to catch up. we'll celebrate properly when it's all over.
this was ordained by fate! long had i foreseen it.
...the madam guardian investigated your backgrounds.
it's cool, i'll be fine! i'm not a little kid anymore!
i refuse to believe it! there's no way that old hag looks like anything like this.
worry not, for very quickly, you will awaken from this dream, forget everything that has transpired, with naught but a faint lingering of loss.
really!? haha, that's great! if i had gone looking for it myself, i'm sure i would've missed it.
honorary knight... i am a little conflicted. what should i do...?
without the necessary tools, and without new knowledge, it will take me some time to see your destiny clearly.
i concur with you. ninja hiryu is a punctilious ninja indeed.
hey, what's the big gathering at the concierge about? we've just arrived and there's already drama?
no, this won't do! i must ask him to rewrite the story!
allow me to introduce you to the most popular little guy in paperfold university! it's more beloved than clockie.
i can't believe they've chased me this far... looks like we'll have to say our goodbyes. don't worry about me. just go and enjoy the ceremony!
come on, let's see if that guard over there will let us past.
yes. no more stellaron hunter interruptions -- it's time to get our original plan back on track. our next stop is penacony, remember?
so how do we go about participating in these festivity auditions?
yes... i have to hand it to you, you can be rather considerate when it counts.
then in comes a bunch of outlanders in strange clothes who gawk and run around everywhere...
traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
i see. the spatial ninjutsu that you displayed earlier was truly ingenious. i wouldn't be surprised if you were a memo ninja from the garden of zencollection.
wait... are you that stellaron hunter hacker girl? what are you doing here!?
as much as it pains me to admit it...
it took nearly twenty years from design to completion to make gears and wisdom... we can't let all that painstaking work and talent go to waste. we have to get it back.
stop trying to resist me!
you definitely sound like a... what was it again...? oh, amicassador! by which i mean -- nice speech.
well, there's no way he'd get past dan heng's sharp eyes.
the world remains constant over the centuries. but human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. transitory.
you're welcome! although if you really wanna thank me... let me play holodisc with peppy -- pleaaaase~?
the content is fine. now we just need to promote it.
why'd you come find me out of the blue? miss me?
this final match allows later generations to understand the origin of warrior's spirit and the meaning of martial arts.
...sounds like you two are getting along! what's numby saying?
good. in that case, with regard to the matter at hand, let's vote to decide our next move.
wow, mister reca was telling the truth! i truly am a genius!
uhh... thanks for your well-wishes.
if that's the case, it appears that we have nothing else to worry about on penacony... looks like it's time for us to embark on a new voyage.
if it weren't for you, i wouldn't have had any idea about the hardships people were going through in the underworld. it made me feel like... maybe i could help a little, and make belobog a better place.
ugh, obviously i can't tell you why, or... you'll see, don't worry.
to pom-pom, i'll always be the train's mechanic, haha.
that's why i've come to ask for your help. i don't have enough proof yet, but i'd like to speculate something: the source of all tragedy lies within the family. if you could trust me... we could find the proof to support this claim, together.
you mean to say that you don't trust me completely?
i always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food... hmm? you'd like to see me do that? hah! i'm sure you would.
this body has no need of rest. but i am an assistant to the one within. if she wishes to rest, i must follow her will.
see? those things are not--
i prepared a whole batch of fireworks for the party, but i forgot to bring them over from the warehouse!
so that's how it is... i never imagined we'd gather the remaining details here.
what!? no! no, no, no -- can't you see i'm just short of hands here?
he thinks he's dead... although when i first fell in, i also thought the same.
there must be something contained in this dream bubble. it's just we haven't figured it out yet. you also have faith in the watchmaker, don't you, gallagher?
never mind, mister yang. if the xianzhou alliance say they can handle it, then we're wasting our breath. let's go.
this building, this playground equipment... i've seen it all before.
i pestered dan heng to tell me about his experiences, but alas, what could've been a magnificent saga was reduced to a few words and a grunt.
this is a dandelion wine-based cocktail -- i asked the bartender to add calla lily because it has a calming effect.
alright then. i believe myself to be relatively well-read, but with stories like these, i don't even know where to start...
besides, this has only come about because i failed to make a timely decision. this issue started with me, and i shall be the one to finish it.
wow! you are getting really good at these kinds of lines!
first things first, though, we need to get out of the city. there's too much magical disturbance here... let's head somewhere where the ley line flow is a little smoother.
could you help me carry them over, mister morris? i won't be able to fetch all of them by myself...
but after shingo dies, you'll be next.
you're back! did everything go smoothly? do you need a cloth to wipe the sweat from your brow?
each season brings its own festival... and each festival, in turn, brings a fresh challenge to the task of maintaining public order...
me too! even though i didn't bring much mora to spend on this trip... it's still better than nothing!
he will be fine. cloud knights, search for the target!
since we're all refreshed, ready to head out for the day?
perhaps the reason you do not possess a vision is that such an ambition has yet to be engendered within you... it's a possibility.
ah, this is the one. please wait for a moment.
i don't know what grudges they have... but this path is a dead end, too.
i had this specially tailored recently -- and i must say, i am really rather fond of it.
another case was where i offered distinctly more competitive terms in an investment, and this ended up arousing their suspicion.
here, these are your wages, as promised. not a single mora short.
i suppose i should get some sleep. hmm, i must say, i do find it hard to doze off peacefully without the soothing sound of thunder booming in the background.
great observation mister gongshu. it's amazing what you notice when you're not fighting...
everyone there is exquisitely dressed and always in a hurry. the greatest wish of the local pepeshi people is for their future generations to work in the gilded hour.
shh -- you're being annoying! i'm not kidding -- this is straight out of the book.
not a soul in sight? the hounds drove out the visitors, and now their whereabouts are unknown too...
if cocolia threatens us by taking bronya hostage...
oh, i see. so if we catch it, there's mora for the taking?
so you're a wine merchant? you must have excellent wine knowledge.
hehe, to be honest, even though i've thought about it countless times before, i still haven't found an answer.
hee-hee, you like it? it's yours. a farewell gift from us.
certainly. pain is but common to a ninja and i shall never flinch in the face of it.
according to the report, lord ravager phantylia is the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy.
why is the antimatter legion targeting you guys? it seems they just ignored the surface of the planet and came straight to the space station.
hmm... the geomarrow fuel activation component probably stopped working. do you have a spare one?
i was just thinking that, we can't rule it out.
but i worry about the worst outcome: if the dreamscape's anomaly really exists, and it isn't a natural occurrence, but instigated by someone behind the scenes...
now that we've finished all the chores, it's time to talk to the imatanis about sakujirou.
strange. i don't remember seeing a big planet near the xianzhou when we were on the express.
hmm? oh, i thought you would have figured it out by now. alright then, i'll indulge you with a little more information.
let's ignore that raven and proceed! there's a secret passage in the cave ahead that leads directly to the top of the tower.
i understand that. but if the dreams of which makoto spoke are true eternity, a short moment for which the shogun does not exist is nothing to fear.
we live in peaceful times, but this harmonious coexistence between life and death should never be taken for granted.
take this one for example: "the good thing about being reincarnated as a hilichurl is that i only need to eat sunsettias to become stronger"...
you sound exactly like master yanqing. but for now, both he and yunli have been forced to go to the alchemy commission for some well-needed rest.
if their names are inscribed here, then that means...
hey, this is called "proof by exhaustion!" it's what the angler does best!
oh, but if you wanted to chat, i'll happily oblige.
so i won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. what matters is that i tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
hmhm! speaking of secret moves, i've prepared some flaming potent tea.
well, it's all in bronya's hands now. she has to make the final call.
i'll be at uyuu restaurant -- find me there when you're done. i will assemble a team, and we can work while we eat.
fine, we'll keep our guards up. our last hotel experience was eventful, to say the least.
do you want to give it a shot? close one eye, aim carefully, and fish it out quickly!
with that thought, there is only one choice: let the bloodhounds send him back home! this person deserves to be punished!
are you leaving? this old town is too dangerous. we'll accompany you part of the way.
and also... my mind was consumed entirely with the plight of inazuma and the fate of those closest to me.
when my bell rings, it means the moonless night is upon us.
but i would prefer to assure my victory in this contest, and upon giving it some thought, you came to mind!
...where did i go wrong? is there any hope for me to improve? if i could start over...
it's rare that i'm this serious, can't you just humor me for once? sheesh!
even if we are doomed to destruction, we will go bravely, walking hand in hand into the darkness...
something up with her? she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
hmm... i personally think the situation on edo star might be more urgent. as nameless, should we not extend a helping hand?
ahem, that's enough praise for now... anyway, if you did want to continue working as a part-time manager and handle the daily operations of the history-culture hall, i recommend talking to miss eris.
destination xianzhou, here we come!
a lot of the old folks like to brag about how i used to be their errand-runner back in the day... hehe.
she even factored my immaturity into her plan.
if you like, i can give all of you a small private show any time.
isn't the fontinalia festival happening right now? i heard aeval tell us on the aquabus that furina introduced the tradition of going door-to-door and asking for sweets.
there's only one way to find out -- let's go ask. i've always found ipc staff easy to talk to.
it's the same routine. you've mastered it, right?
your analysis is accurate. however, in my humble opinion, now may not be the best time to call the harmony shogunate for aid.
what's this...? some kind of energy flow?
in fact, the name "baal" and the title of raiden shogun was understood to refer to both of them, right up until--
but training and work are still the things i need to focus on.
...i'm kidding. dan heng needs the room to sleep in, after all.
ahem! that's just my surname, don't mind that... this is so embarrassing, hahaha...
no time for guesses! let's just head to rivet town and find gepard first.
it's vast and deep like an ocean. even the humblest people can find solace here.
don't worry about it. as far as the astrological aspect goes, this will be a piece of cake.
for my part, i did my utmost to fulfill the duties of a responsible adult.
surely you don't think all that was "business development"!?
even if the ending has been predetermined, that's fine. there are countless things that humans cannot change.
nope, won't fit... better try another.
if it wants to devour me, it will first have to beg for my mercy!
no matter where you two go, i know that our friendship and its warmth will support you.
ah, so that means... we're not going to the luofu.
hey, even i can say things that sound profound and mysterious!
i mean it... i admire you a lot, and i'm so proud to be friends with someone of such fine character.
...that's ninjutsu i learned by myself. it's hard to teach it to others.
but before the end, there are many things that humans can do while on their journey.
alright, alright -- it's all a misunderstanding. you two should reflect on your actions!
dreammaster, it's just to prove that the charmony festival has nothing to do with the stellaron. if we're being overly cautious... i will return to the stage to offer tribute in song, just per the arrangement.
so i am not against dressing up, far from it.
i agree, but it struck me as an honest letter -- i found the contents quite moving. it's hard to imagine she'd write something like this just to deceive me.
hearing, touch, thought -- through these, you gain emotions -- cherish them. with emotions, we make choices. and so we return to the original question...
i have heard about the thunderstorm, though. as to the cause, it is not inconceivable that, as you suggest, her will has wavered somewhat.
so for ordinary folks, the best-case scenario is ignorance of all matters concerning spirits and the afterlife -- or even better, a belief that none of it exists.
i always wondered -- how did he, a rich kid with virtually no real life experience, suddenly think of becoming a smuggler?
they don't seem to care much about "death"... instead, they're more concerned about the charmony festival and the watchmaker.
yes... she had such a great love for this land, and for its people. in this respect, i still do not compare to her.
just a minute, wait! this is for you.
i feel like it needs a sign saying "mortals forbidden" or something... are you sure it won't fly into a rage if we walk past it?
i plan to wear it the next time i'm out shopping. but there are too many designs and colors... i can't decide.
mister kurisu, i need to know the exact time and location of the theft, and anything that stood out about the perpetrators' appearance.
as expected of penacony's festive superstar. i'm so jealous...
not bad, huh? hehe. let's go as soon as everyone's ready. don't worry master masakatsu, we're on our way!
but... i'm still not sure which of them is our tail...
*sigh* it's a shame, they still wouldn't give him a permit, even though he was born and raised in inazuma.
however, there are still other things we can do. let's keep going.
ever since you encountered those borisin spies, you've been so busy that you've hardly eaten anything. you can't defeat hoolay on an empty stomach.
their divinations will lose the power to guide, and will not be able to pierce the fog of the unknown before them. principles are principles.
what about you, lynxy? did you find anything good?
oh? you play rock 'n' roll too? cool!
ninja initiate gigaku, deliver your final line.
never mind, it's not that important. the important question is: what are the ipc doing on jarilo-vi?
maybe visiting the nation built by the geo archon could help me learn something new...
y--you're quite welcome!
only by achieving victory in this battle can we secure a future for penacony. and only then, my third and final death... won't come true in the most terrible form.
unlike the outside world, what inazuma seeks is eternity. in other words, a state of tranquility, where very little ever changes.
haha, i'm only kidding.
ugh... i know, i know. let me think about it...
now that your measurements are taken, let's go to mingxing jewelry and put an order in.
...*sigh*, i told you it'd take a while to tell the story -- let's get back to the workshop first. by the way... wanna help me pack my bags?
maid noelle of the knights of favonius, at your service!
hmm, interesting... so many merchants and business magnates, vying to invite me to dinner.
when i read this notebook, i realized... she was just like me. underneath whatever position she may have held, she was just an ordinary person.
i'm sorry, i said i'd forget such problems for a while... and, as expected, here they are keeping me company.
allow me to introduce you all to zhongli, a consultant at the wangsheng funeral parlor.
actually, don't tell me -- let me guess! hmm... from the looks on your faces, you've got some questions for me?
i can only help people with small things... like finding lost property.
but let's make a deal. how cooperative you are now decides how much immunity i give you when this gets investigated.
well, i wouldn't expect you to trust us, considering that you have had far more interactions with the adepti. the reason i invited you here was to clear up some misunderstandings.
come on, start praying with me! ! please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful. please let this trip be uneventful...
i must admit, without her highness' reminder, the weinlesefest may well have completely passed me by...
yeah, um... it's a difficult thing to talk about, but here goes...
...you're right. i've probably been idle for too long -- it's easy to get stuck in your own head.
perhaps you haven't met me on the battlefield, but i'm certain you've heard my name. now, i'm asking you a question, so answer me! tell me...
hah... the scenery out here is fine indeed, but the wind is a little strong. our preparations to receive guests within are complete -- so please, this way.
this is a big town. where should we start?
um, you might not wanna hear this, but your general gave us his word. we have to be present when you question kafka.
you didn't want to listen to us! we were here to rescue you and you started a fight for no reason!
ah, it's too late for regrets... i'll let that one go.
there's something i need your help with -- i had to make it up to you somehow.
...that's just my charm! and i didn't cause any trouble. you just have to get used to me... look, dan heng agrees, right?
as far as malfunctions on the train are concerned, i've usually dealt with them before you guys even realize anything's amiss.
wow... i didn't expect to find a place like this in the underworld!
you can head back to your rooms for some rest, or stay here and make yourselves a cup of coffee, whichever you like.
what's going on inside the mine? any ideas?
let's go. the venue for this meeting is in the kanjou commission headquarters up there. the view is excellent, making it a perfect place to drink tea and discuss creative ideas.
either. both are confidential.
so, this must be an adepti abode... hmm, though it's a bit different from what i imagined, it's still most fascinating.
yeah, you're right! we've even dealt with a lord ravager of the destruction, so a follower of the order won't be a big deal!
you will miss much by refusing progress... you seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
sorry. maybe i was overreacting...
looks like we've got to help those guys kneeling down over there calm down a bit, right?
give me a few minutes, just a few. i'll explain every--
i also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver beidou's message. here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
plus, this is the family's turf. teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
after all, few have ever proved capable of withstanding my blade. it would be a pleasure to train with you.
nothing looks out of place, and everything's spaced out just right.
so, stay with me a while, and let's chat about the simpler things in life. anything at all.
aww, poor thing.
now that i think about it, perhaps i never needed to recommend that store to you in the first place.
things are getting more amusing by the second.
sure, i'd be happy to do that for you.
i wish to borrow a tea set from the yashiro commission.
oh, disillusioned fiendlings... awaken now and continue down the path to seek your own way of the ninja!
consider this -- no one will lose their life on account of having their vision taken away...
that's because that wall records liyue's secrets. merchants have always been attracted to secrets.
i know, right? that's just how she is! she used to call herself megistus, actually, but once she took me in, she changed her name to trismegistus...
huh? we've been transported again, but we're not back on the beach.
...it seems like i'm too old to qualify for that.
thank you. i was really delighted to learn that you also entered the competition...
uh... is this my room? i didn't get a chance to tidy up. don't judge...!
let's go. braving the unknown... that's the real spirit of trailblazing!
eh? how come... mister alois isn't with you?
well... *ahem* astrologists are often regarded as something out of this world, right? but what if my mirage is nothing like that...?
hmm? haven't i already mentioned that i cannot make food?
a ninja's super hearing can capture even the death of a proton. you spoke loudly before me. i wasn't eavesdropping.
whoa, there are so many huge mushrooms here. they're big enough to lie on!
there's something in it for you as well, should you come with me to get that box.
starsnatch cliff, another beautiful location -- and so elevated! this place is super famous for its nightscape.
...most people in a frenzy don't stop to ponder the details.
to put it simply, we are just looking for the right person to help. we had a very long discussion about it, but to no avail.
i was shy! talking about personal stuff like that in front of everyone... it'd be too embarrassing!
yanming, what is it that you've prepared?
just give me one second with my scryglass, then we'll see where exactly this homeland of yours features in your personal history!
uh... this morning? yeah, that's right. he's on urban patrol duty today, right? that's why he popped round and asked the favor.
you keep playing. i'll go and get some drinks.
so the "holy land" in the book's title refers to the immernachtreich. this book sings the praises of the prinzessin from the perspective of the people in her kingdom.
and this is our final hope. ena's dream is founded upon the harmonious choir, namely everyone's shared wishes. it will only materialize once the aspirations of all beings in penacony merge as one.
you're surrounded by all kinds of friends, secrets, and destinies. it's incredible.
between these two, who do you think is tougher? don't get me wrong, i'm just curious.
the embodiment of the harmony? so, the true purpose of the charmony festival... is to usurp it?
miss fu xuan? is that you?
is everything all right, bronya? i didn't know miss topaz was so... intense. she seemed nice when we met her.
museum manager -- voted among the top three "most highly desired careers after graduation!" in a belobog academy poll. needless to say, we offer a competitive package.
come with me. to make this chess piece, i need to take some measurements.
i understand. that's why i've been taking things one step at a time. the first step was changing your mind.
i realized something else when going through the data bank -- the encryption for your data bank is pretty weak...
and when we were in dreamflux reef, you may have noticed that for some reason, nobody outside of the crew... had ever talked with clockie.
it's always very fulfilling to work here! more so than when i'm cleaning for the knights or anywhere else.
i just finished today's cleaning for the knights and was about to start my training when i saw you!
my oh my! i had no idea i was up against such a legendary warrior in our card duel earlier!
the guards stationed in the underworld reported that some suspicious characters have been meeting at a hideout in the great mine late at night.
one must start by focusing on the person's individual circumstances and communicate a complete willingness to help, then slowly move the conversation in the desired direction...
don't be sorry! it's not like we're in a rush. wanna come to the city with us? the snow plains are freezing, and it's easier than you think to get lost out here.
back in the day, at youkai gatherings, once everyone had had plenty to drink, one by one they'd start soaring into the sky with their youkai powers. there were so many of them that their silhouettes would block out the moon.
you've heard of this military tactic, right? when you surround your enemy, leave one side open for them to escape. a skilled hunter must be well-prepared, waiting for the prey at the most advantageous position.
my scryglass has long since preordained all that will take place beneath the stars it reflects.
ah... ms. belinda, is that you?
have you... made up your mind, firefly?
but according to the data recorded in that robot, svarog... the architects dug out the truth long ago. the research results were purposely hidden away to ensure that the outside world would never know of them.
we will meet her here presently.
when i was younger, i didn't know what weariness was. even at night, i was restless. i'd always drag my brother along to count the stars. the more stars i counted, the more energetic i got...
that old man's story... it's so tragic. fortunately, this sweet dream gives him joyful memories to hold onto for the rest of his life.
never mind who they are, let's just film them. that way, if they do anything bad, we'll have solid evidence against them.
you don't say! then it sounds like the shirasagi himegimi has a plan... awesome! i've been thinking about breaking him out too recently.
that's right! i hope that this sweet fruit will help you brew the sweetest wine.
she was there. she just made sure no one could see her.
so i would advise you to be cautious.
i'd like to walk around a bit more... don't worry, i won't go far. see you tomorrow.
your average astrologist would definitely give up at this point.
no, absolutely not! haha... it's not like i'm worried about everyone judging me after seeing my embarrassingly pathetic mirage or anything...
oh, how about this! do you need a hand? as long as we can get through your orders, you can help me process my ore, right?
aiya, enough with the modesty already! if i didn't know better, i'd say you seemed nervous. just focus on judging.
alright, i admit that for a few seconds there, the thought may have crossed my mind.
i know. our ancestors wouldn't have risked using one if they'd had other ways of avoiding calamity.
but if the tenryou commission does catch up to you, then make a run for the boat.
you see? brothers and sisters need to have a scrap once in a while to get back on good terms.
illustrious names? ...uhh, sure. i'm march seventh, this is mister yang -- oh -- mister welt yang, and this is--
don't you think it's a fun idea, someone being reborn as the raiden shogun? that's all that light novels are supposed to be -- a bit of fun.
pfft! as if anyone wants your junkyard scrap mechs!
i'm going to take a nap... just a quick one.
anyway, master jean did say that as long as we keep on top of our work, we should take a look around while we're here and get involved in the poetry gala as much as we can.
it's you two! what are you doing in fontaine?
but people's lifestyles began to change after liyue harbor was founded. they no longer had to travel out of town to tend the fields anymore, so the use of firecrackers for emergencies also began to dwindle.
oh... is that right? well, i'm not sure that's a very suitable story for klee. um... we might keep looking around.
greetings, old friends and new. so, what brings you all to wangsheng funeral parlor this fine day?
by the way, have you heard about that recent murder case?
which means that the content of this book must have been approved by her... in fact, no. it may even have been her idea in the first place.
if one believes that astrology grants them unlimited power, they will face banishment by the stars.
hmph. then i will come again once your preparation is complete. i have time.
norbert said he usually communicates with mister cold feet through the door of a room in the goethe hotel. the usual agreed meeting time is... right now.
and let's not forget we started with no initial capital. it's reasonable to expect building something from nothing to be highly demanding.
looks like you've been keeping an eye on the skysplitter. have you noticed anything unusual?
ah, yes. about what we had discussed before... i did try, but i'm afraid i couldn't reach the old hag. i'll try again tonight, but i wouldn't get your hopes up...
so, honorary knight... the ore mining training... h--how did i do?
this tastes wonderful! uh, would you mind teaching me how to make this? after all, it is my duty as a maid...
stop! don't you dare insult xianzhou swordplay like that! if you have the guts, i'll show your mechs what i can do!
however, in order to lift the curse, we need a suitable location... and we need to make some preparations.
left, to the end of the corridor. i will wait there for you.
even if i had that kind of power, i wouldn't dream of abusing it. i assure you, the dried fruits and pastries i brought are quite ordinary.
as it happens, i also received an invitation letter via sara.
don't think that's the case, gallagher. i'm sure mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
i'm really sorry for bringing down the vibe! quick, dan heng, tell us a dad joke to lighten the mood!
march... march? please reply. have you left the room?
do not merely cast your protective gaze upon the land. instead, focus your sights on our city and each of the citizens that dwell within it.
hello! i'm noelle, maid of the knights of favonius.
that's all for now... nothing more noteworthy.
your arrival is untimely. the morning star has just waned... breakfast? no, i--i've already eaten.
...ahem, sorry, i was in work mode.
looks like we've come to an agreement! any objections before we proceed?
strange, there's nothing in here... let's keep looking around.
what a coincidence! someone else who refuses to listen to the doctor's orders.
actually, i've never seen a rabbit in real life, i've only seen pictures and read about them in books. so when i first saw pom-pom, i thought...
and there's this one, this book's about... mmm... hmm... hmm?
the tombstone that belongs to me once bore the inscription "glamoth's iron cavalry," then it changed to "stellaron hunter," but one day...
and even ei is finally starting to come to her senses. quite a miracle, given how pig-headed she can be.
every journey into the unknown is a mystery waiting to be solved. but often, it is encounters with the unexpected that make the journey all the more interesting.
pleasure! but are you thanking us or giving yourself a compliment?
wh--what? no! are you serious?
ah, hello little ones. i take it you have received my commission, hmm?
she stares at the screens. is she looking at herself in the mirror? ...what does she mean by "try again"?
i cannot guarantee that we will win, but we must try our best, if just to give the crowd a show they will not forget.
hehe, no need. while what's-his-face is handling that, we'll take a walk around and ask people what they know about the two brothers. maybe we'll find out some amusing details.
a perfectly clear statement turned confusing thanks to your translation -- you've made me lose where i was now. anyway, this is how i operate in battle, so you might as well get used to it.
hehe, no need to be nervous. i'm yoimiya, and i run naganohara fireworks.
i chatted with him a bit when avin was showing me around. he seems really knowledgeable. i bet he'll know something.
i have a feeling that it could be some sort of code...
i'm not so good at analyzing people, but seeing as you asked...
my apologies. i am unfamiliar with this particular ninja tool. it's best i leave it to you.
it will be a lot of work, and i'm most grateful to you.
your confidence actually makes me even more worried... this isn't like helping a child make a snowball.
uh... kind of, it was general jing yuan who helped us shoot it down.
kujou kamaji... a descendant of the kujou clan, i presume.
right, we should get going. i am not letting new business escape us.
regardless, i cannot accept my home is moving towards the very opposite of what the harmony represents, while still claiming to uphold it.
ah, we're finally back! ...i forgot what fresh air tasted like... nom, nom, nom.
it sure is... *sigh* let's press on and see what awaits.
...uh, i wasn't worried about you. if you must know, i was wondering if bronya was okay.
oh, by the way... the museum's previous manager resigned recently to pursue his dream of becoming a writer... so, if you're interested, do you think you'd like to take up the post part-time?
ooh, is that right? well, you wouldn't be the first person who's tried to put wangsheng funeral parlor out of business. if you're serious about it, you'll have your work cut out for you.
even though sweet dreams are nice, they're just illusions. but for him, they're the only way to survive, even if it means giving up on reality... that's not really living at all.
pom-pom? what are you talking about?
blonde, tall, good-looking... *sigh* those landau genes sure are something else.
mm, maybe not. he's still wheezing from the trouble we got into on the xianzhou. you didn't notice?
there is nothing to feel distressed about, because nothing, i repeat, nothing, happened here in these woods today. did it?
hehehe... you are the same as ever, kujou sara. no one can match you when it comes to loyalty to the shogun.
"keeper"? you mean guard, right?
why is the family running a school in a dream anyway? do people really come to the planet of festivities just to study?
this may seem a little sudden... but in my view, you are the only person i can entrust this to.
sure! i can help out with the tent -- i memorized that section in the camping guide.
i double-checked with micah, and everything he said about the family, the watchmaker, and mikhail is true.
well hello there, young ones. what brings you to the shrine? it just so happens that i have a wonderful novel here. i highly recommend it.
we can both perceive these extraordinary things in the dream, probably due to our ability to react to memoria. but you're more attuned to it than i am.
i never leave a question unanswered. i am a ninja, aka rappa.
since the goal here is to bond with our fungi, we should treat them as friends and create happy memories with them. eating and having fun together are vital components of "friendship training."
what are your thoughts on the scenes we just witnessed?
drinking like this is disastrous for one's health...
head to the nearest platform. getting to the express is our top priority.
perfect. okay, so i have some paper, paintbrushes, and paint at the shop. let's go to the shop and paint your story there.
before our next expedition, i need himeko to teach me some negotiation skills. beating people up all the time is cramping my elegance!
long story short, regardless of why the xianzhou alliance invited us, joining this wardance is of august meaning to belobog.
ah... i guess even troupe members can experience existential crises...
while that might be the biggest reason, it's not the only one.
guess that's a no... well, maybe we can talk about potentially expanding your company's services sometime.
well, i was born in mondstadt, yes. my parents migrated to dornman port, and i traveled with the old hag for a while, after which i settled down in mondstadt city.
next time, maybe ease off on the surprises?
the pure waters of melted snow are optimal for hydromancy.
it's like that party game that the people of the yaoqing love to play: they hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
but you never mentioned this to me...
despite that unfortunate outcome, i still believe it was the right decision. birds aren't meant to spend their lives in cages... they belong in the sky, even if they can't fly.
*sigh* i've had a lot of free time recently, so i was thinking about writing some new songs. sadly, that's about as far as i got...
gepard said that you wanted to help us reverse the damage that the eternal freeze and fragmentum continue to wreak on our planet... but that night, mother summoned me, and ordered me to take a detachment to arrest you.
yes. you should look forward to it.
you're the one who needs to leave. i'm not letting this go.
may your blades... ah forget it. let's go and make this a quick victory!
sounds like it might be kazuha's grandfather.
if it's a gunfire trial... we should be able to settle it with a fight, right? i hope this won't waste too much of our time.
even in the ice... could these guys still be alive...?
i know... thanks, you guys, it's just that fireworks are banned in the city for a few days. i'm not that upset, really.
...wow, things are getting tense!
all the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. i stand before it alone and unchanging.
it's so dangerous, don't you worry about him?
mother and i are so similar in so many ways. the things she faced are things that i too will go on to face.
areas around mondstadt... slimes... leave them to me!
sorry, i'm afraid we need to take the pinball machine to reach this place... you go first, and i'll be right behind you.
it's a whole row of those gate robots! we saw one in the divination commission...
clients in need come to our door and write down their commissions on blank wooden tiles. then, they squeeze those inside the parlor through the crack under the door.
i bet argenti would think these fireworks were really... beautiful.
...thank you. seems you understand me far better than most people.
walk with me. let's forget our problems for a while.
so, in argenti's eyes, wubbaboos are a thing of beauty...
ah, it's nothing. nothing at all. now that we've eaten and drank our fill, we should be off.
and no guardians of liyue chess set would be complete without you, would it?
ugh, who designed this operating system! it's so unintuitive!
really? seems like i got it wrong, then...
well then that's as good as nothing for now... so, what should we do when we get back above ground? after all this talk, we're still back at square one...
ooh, do you think we'll see anything interesting after nightfall? like... a statue coming to life, or an eerie fire underwater...
so, i rode the aquabus with yoimiya and visited the opera house on erinnyes island.
no, not at all. don't be so nervous, i'm just here to look around.
here we are again. what kind of song are you in the mood for now?
in those days, it was difficult for people to contact one another while out farming the land, so they would carry firecrackers with them to give signals when necessary.
seeing it up close... this vein's even more spectacular.
it's fine. i don't mind, so long as i can alleviate your suspicions.
let's go! i can't wait to finally get back above ground!
hmph, if you think you can commit crimes and go unpunished, dream on!
here's our ingredient for you. oh, but i can't take full credit for it! i had help from an alchemist, but right now, she... umm...
i don't know. before i could figure out what was going on, it spat me out...
haha... i was just joking. i've been waiting for you.
yes. the truth of the matter is that there were two twin gods, baal and beelzebul.
what's going on... how come we're back at the start?
is that so... well, i respect your choice.
understood, ninja hiryu aoi dan heng.
ominous? clockie is a household name here. there would never be anything ominous about him... right?
suffering and pain -- the fruits of blind hate, a hero draws their sword ready for the fight to break.
given that we are in a mirage, xinyan, did anything significant happen inside the house?
when you put it that way... it is indeed difficult to distinguish dreams and hallucinations.
i guess... wait, no! it won't do if you have no idea at all, even if you are a fake disciple.
master yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. i don't think you have very good taste.
according to my scryglass, we've arrived at the mirage. okay, let's find the entrance first...
haha... i have my reasons.
now let's get out there and win this thing... we'll move faster than a firework shooting straight into the sky! it'll be like whoooshhh and the round will be ours!
again? i'm starting to get nervous of "arranged rest" on this planet...
finches pinch the rice and scoot, while the boars of the forest anxiously root!
too chicken? i was giving you the chance to back out! but you're actually insulting me now, you cheeky...
thunder's roar and lightning's flash. so ephemeral. this is why reaching eternity is desirable. ...actually, no -- this is why reaching eternity is necessary.
(anyway, it's not like we're gonna be able to conjure up exactly what luocha ran into. why not use our own interpretation to bridge the gap?)
robin believed it was because the harmony had been tampered with somehow, but as far as i know, there aren't many entities capable of interfering with the power of paths.
what about that smiley fox healer and the guy with the hood...
why would someone keep the plant in there if it's dead?
uh, you already ate that, remember? i can't just get you another one now, can i?
one day, i believe it will overshadow all seven nations.
let's go for one more round in the administrative district! i wanna take more photos!
so i am afraid i can't help you.
it's pretty much the same situation here. neither party is willing to compromise.
ah, it must've been poor luocheng that you followed. maybe he didn't notice you, but he could still feel your presence. now we know what caused his nightmares.
wait! can you recommend some sights? it's not that late, we wanna take a look around.
then let this be our final duel, the conclusion to that which began five hundred years ago.
hehe, you are the one who's been acting like a child from the very beginning.
during the irodori festival, the area around the outlander affairs agency will become the main exhibition space for light novels.
ah, yes. so, before alice left, did she tell you about a fifty-year agreement, and about a certain box?
i've merely changed your state of mind for you to feel more at ease.
...that's how families are.
he must be a fan of this book too... i knew angler mystery fans couldn't be bad!
in this splendid metropolis, some have a dream called penacony, but some have dreams... that are no different from reality, even though everyone who comes here harbors the same motive in the beginning.
heehee~ of course! i'm a college student who keeps up with the times.
but they said i had to join "the moles" or something if i wanted to find out... and to do that, i had to prove my strength by winning a game of hide-and-seek... do you get it?
our little miracle worker here seems very different from everyone else around -- don't you think mister yang?
you're saying... you like how i wear my vision? you certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. well then, i bet you'd like to pet it.
this is something i made up so that good luck will be on our side, that's all!
well, in case you'd forgotten... i am a genius!
maybe i should just do a quick reading for safety...
here, take it -- the corridor of fading echoes mastery mark -- you've earned it!
who knows, perhaps you will have a completely different impression of me after i change outfits.
it certainly feels that way. it feels like it was only yesterday when you were teaching me to hold a musket.
yes, this should be plenty of valberries...
compared to the aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of aeons and the paths.
but this is just our first meeting. it's a little too early to announce it to the general public.
so... i am very curious about this mysterious individual. i would very much like to meet them.
but as a maid of favonius, i can't stand idly by when people are in need.
no matter. the fiendling deserves its rightful punishment. ninja initiate merchant, though...
excuse me, glory. have you heard anything that might be described as a flapping sound in this area recently?
your equipment probably has better specs than mine -- i'll leave the picture-taking to you.
sorry, i know the invitation was very last minute... but i needed to get the news out as soon as possible. the longer people waited, the more rumors started to swirl. the situation risked spinning out of control.
i didn't mean it like that. if we ever ran into any problems, i'm sure i'd figure something out.
hello, i'm here to collect the item i handed in for repair.
at least we know who to look for next. we can ask the bloodhound family for information.
looks like the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding.
to the wolf masters, foxians are nothing but property, cannon fodder used to slow down the xianzhou attacks on the battlefield.
i can't believe my own eyes either, but i know that sculpture inside and out.
i said, why haven't you left?
a wide open view, fresh air... it's such a nice place!
"a small something for the lost..."
yes, though it is something very precious to one of my informants. it reminds her of her mother.
...it's you. don't sneak up behind me next time. lucky for you i wasn't armed.
ready for your tea break? please wait here while i get it ready. oh yes, i also made lighter-than-air pancakes! you simply must try one, it's my specialty.
so, even the mighty stellaron hunter is willing to admit defeat, huh...
wow, what are these? they're so cute!
this is one problem that even the musou no hitotachi will not be able to solve.
not to mention that shoddily designed backdoor command... did you honestly believe that no one would notice the litany of vulnerabilities in your grand plan?
the situation has changed, and it seems that companion... has deviated from the original plan.
honestly, this would have happened sooner or later. you just gave me an excuse to bring everything forward.
look for another -- every platform linked to the gear bridge should have a similar terminal.
er... just one chest? i'm sure that's not a trap. should we open it...?
you know, you're right, paimon! is it just me, or have you gotten wiser since we first met?
they're the ones who accept ena's dream and indulge in their happy illusions...
warriors of the past who spilled your blood on this land, your noble souls now rest in this earth.
i believe firefly is trying to say that she's heading off to another battle.
so i hear you're an honorary knight of favonius? i envy you! i suppose that makes you my senior... anyway, it's about time someone threw you a welcome party, surely? leave it to me!
i must be seeing things. why are there two fu xuans here?
sadly they are quite mistaken! i am still far from becoming a real knight...
i have to say, it's hard to believe that this was your first time playing!
i know your past. the things you want to see, to touch, to know...
i will be eagerly awaiting your visit. it would be wonderful if you could visit my home and enjoy a taste of our tea and desserts.
perhaps it's because... i'm the electro archon's familiar.
people show you whatever side of themselves they want you to see. i know this for a fact.
...exam preparation? ...defend mondstadt?
i must uncover the reason why mikhail cut ties with the family, and who exactly it was who betrayed us all. do you remember our arrangement, mister micah? well, here's my answer...
don't worry, we can keep a secret. just make sure it doesn't happen again!
i'm so lucky to have two great masters! but why does it feel like things are getting a bit weird?
although these three items are rare, i trust that with your connections and capabilities, procuring them will not be a question of "if," but of "when."
oh dear, everyone's laundry is still on the line! may i be excused to fetch it in?
let me know if you see her, alright? i'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. she always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!
fireworks that disappear in a flash of light are probably the furthest thing away from the eternity that our shogun desires.
allow me to introduce my assistants to you. they help me take care of business at the workshop.
but it turned out you had come to rescue me... you came for my sake, to help me reach the best possible outcome.
if we can get rid of it, your world will be safer too!
as for what the trailblaze, the aeons, and akivili are all about, let's talk about it when things have calmed down a little. i don't wanna overwhelm you now, do i?
sounds like there really was something on her mind.
let's not forget that i am the eldest daughter of the kamisato clan. i would be very surprised indeed if anybody in the kanjou commission felt that i was accountable to them for my actions.
yeah... feels like we're missing something...
anyways, what i'm trying to say is that we're seeking ways to remove the influence of the stellaron and the fragmentum.
don't fret, it's just a few bandits.
persikov was dead set on carrying out his experiments on this island. most of his subjects were junior fatui soldiers who all signed a waiver before the experiment.
in the bar? but aren't all the ingredients right there on the counter?
thanks. i feel like i'm starting to get the hang of it.
don't worry. the shogun's not broken, i've just temporarily disabled many of her functions.
don't forget we're on a tight schedule here. be sure to bring back the evidence in good time.
hmm? was there something else you wanted to talk about?
youhei, your brother's life is hanging in the balance, and he's using his final breaths to call on you for help. whatever shall we do?
one, two, three, four... so many training targets...
my first thought was, "has a great disaster befallen inazuma?"
no stress, nat. just tell us what you really think.
the exam is drawing nearer and nearer, but there just seems to be an endless amount of material to review... *sigh*
can i see this as an invitation from diamond to the stellaron hunters while keeping the ipc in the dark?
but do you still remember what size your sister wears? the kimono might look a little off if you get the size wrong.
normally you'd want a heater inside a building, right?
i know how much it means to you. it was a gift from your mom before she left liyue harbor, wasn't it?
no matter what tartaglia's true identity might be... he's doing something good right now, and i think he deserves to be treated accordingly.
revenge... is also a form of the hunt. however, that doesn't explain how she managed to bring the stellaron into the scalegorge waterscape, which was guarded by the vidyadhara.
hah, there's plenty of precious stuff in here! you aren't looking for treasure in the museum while pretending to volunteer, right?
besides, only the loser would want to get--
gallagher... does have a troubled past, it seems.
i think we should lead with a bang, dip into a slippedy-slide, then whoosh into a woop-woop! boom.
*sigh* forget it. i think our taste in nicknames is different.
not really, though it wasn't the friendliest conversation. we didn't see eye to eye on everything.
perhaps she's around here somewhere? shouldn't we take a look?
we're almost there. can you still walk?
you caught a cold, ate something bad, or just scared yourself sick, it's anyone's guess... but i'm leaning towards the last option. it wouldn't be the first time in my career.
of course. we've come this far. surely there's no other option than moving forward.
it takes someone with sturdy sea legs to handle this job, but even then... i just can't tell whether beidou will be able to fish out everything herself.
just... enough with the ambiguous phrasing, okay? you'll give people the wrong idea... ugh, forget it. let's just go.
they're embryos for now, but their transformation into larvae could be imminent... and their growth may exceed our initial estimates.
maybe he spent all his money on startaro bubble tea and couldn't afford a hotel room!
the venue is right over there. why not go and take a walk around? oh, and if you meet my fellow finalist, do pass on my regards.
take a right turn at the end of this road and you'll reach the trade district. there are more people there, and perhaps someone knows where she is.
...i understand.
you've made an exceptional contribution toward the building of the new jade chamber.
without knowing it, i've ended up fulfilling several of my mother's wishes already. *sigh* but going to a festival is the one thing that i cannot do for her.
we have such a good relationship, so... surely you won't mind?
only a strong enough will can prevent you from being swallowed by the giant waves of abstract space. only if you are strong enough can i deliver you to the right destination.
yes, but i won't be putting my feet up. there's a lot to take care of here on the train.
uh... i--it's hard to describe.
mikhail, that's the name. now we all know him as the watchmaker.
speaking of which, don't you think that the concept of "focusing on the now" perfectly suits the current inazuma?
everyone, pay attention. the other party has obviously come prepared.
understand the local culture and immerse ourselves within it.
but how long can your will remain strong?
then we need to get moving. the longer they have to react, the fewer clues they'll leave behind.
indeed. but today... can you help bea come up with a solution?
exactly, that's what we need to take care of next. fortunately, i've already managed to identify the author -- he's a failed light novelist named tomoyuki.
curious? about the heater? it's just a standard geomarrow radiator -- you can find them anywhere in the administrative district.
the path to hell is paved with heavenly treasure; devils trying to fool you, better get your head together. the hunters hide greed with a welcoming smile; don't be beguiled, it could be your last mile.
that was really how i felt back when i first started out in astrology but...
would you be interested in continuing to work as shrine maidens? or perhaps you'd like to work as editors at yae publishing house instead?
and while i'm no expert in exotic dishes... if i'm not mistaken, pizza is round, is it not? like mora meat.
you can see us as... kindhearted interstellar public servants, lending a helping hand to any world affected by a stellaron!
yes, and also... never mind, i'll just show you. it won't eat up too much time.
too many faces, too small a budget. maybe next time.
quick, act natural and get inside. don't get spotted!
if only himeko could come with us...
not telling yet... we'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but i'm keeping you in suspense for now~
if there's anything you want to talk about, zhongli, you know you can come to me. i'm all ears.
hmm, wolvendom... i remember reading that there are wolfhooks everywhere, but the book made no specific mention of any other plants...
that must be the first step in their mind control process. you were lucky.
so... should we tell everyone the deal?
indeed. and that little girl heading into the fragmentum all by herself... it doesn't bear thinking about.
well, i assume so, otherwise he wouldn't have been scared half to death.
great! maybe, just maybe, things will be different this time...
perhaps. but if this is indeed the world that people desire -- if this is precisely why life chooses to slumber -- should we still seek to change it?
let's write about inazuma in the third chapter, shall we? i can help with this one. we can use the vision hunt decree or your experience in the resistance, any ideas?
my pom-pom toy... not a bad idea! that's kinda like bringing the conductor on vacay with me. ah, but i think it's too big to stuff in the case...
this is an adeptus relic from liyue, right? it's incredible. i thought you were joking when you asked me to get into this pot.
exactly. they traverse freely between different worlds as memetic entities and are only visible to certain people. doesn't she sound very much like that clockie you saw?
don't worry, mister yang.
...but it would consume a considerable amount of time to explain the tenets of astrology...
ahem! excuse me... anyway, in my case she practically beat the door down to get me to come along... whatever she says, please don't be too astonished.
the man stopped and realized that it was as if he was in another world. strange creatures that didn't appear to be human were all staring at him...
we must celebrate both the completion of the jade chamber and the fact that liyue has weathered another crisis. this banquet must be the most spectacular ever.
after a lot of thought, i think i've figured it out.
xinyan, do you think this could be your island?
wow! we wiped them all out in a single explosion! that's what you call efficiency!
let me take a look... mm, so these are the suspects. ahem, hmm, i see...
this place is the rift between dream and reality. a place reserved only for those who have awakened from ena's dream.
of course! in mondstadt, roses represent the saying, "as wine bottles are corked, so too my lips are sealed."
are we really going to eat that...?
i guess sampo. businessman, magician, liar, and now guide... this kind of work was made for him.
my scryglass was still blurry, but i felt a force coming from within. i couldn't see its exact position, but i knew that it was changing.
you're self-contradictory and unreasonable, only striving to further your own agenda. there's no need to listen to such lessons!
after all, if i were to leave the city, i wouldn't be there when people needed me...
jeez, you sound just like those parents on the xianzhou! can't i get some praise now?
you...! every time an important moment arrives, you hesitate.
next time you wish to see her, you can come and take the pass permit from me again. she would never admit to it, but she does, in fact, get quite lonely.
not to worry! mister giovanni will explain it all, right?
oops, aaaand i'm busted.
...to the festival's invitation, to all lies, and the singular truth...
come on, master diviner -- i'll give you a whirlwind tour of belobog.
but if nothing else, i know that we must avoid another war at all costs. the people cannot be made to suffer like that again.
hmm... i ended it with a period. it was a statement, not a threat.
the wind that blows from afar carries fresh life to these shores...
well, it's nothing too poetic. i was just thinking about all the twists and turns we went through when we first arrived at the xianzhou ship...
while words can be deceiving, your gaze, your breathing, and your scent... they reveal more than your words do.
i thought this is just the kind of thing that'd get written into your "script".
well, we had a lot of stumbles along the way, but we still managed to kick butt and save the luofu without breaking a sweat. feels kinda surreal.
we're here at last! the family sure doesn't play around with their entry protocols. our bags probably know what it feels like to be a celebrity now, with all that attention!
i think you need a chance. a chance to discover just how different you really are from everyone else. everybody keeps telling you about how special you are, and how you have a stellaron inside you...
it's unnecessary, as far as i'm concerned. but since you are inviting me... a change of pace might well be nice.
the shogun can't do much at the moment. come straight in and see me.
"be ambitious in life, do something big for once..." coming from the mouth of a wealthy gentleman, that sounded rather curious to me.
(uh-huh, so why is he telling us all this?)
hehe, thanks, klee, i feel like we really get each other. we'll be great friends, i'm sure of it.
this morning, rex lapis appeared to me in a dream.
how? because i'm a master of true astrology.
because she is a god. it's not that gods don't need the company of others, just that the idea of a god having company seems indulgent to her.
although we've been through so much together, i actually know very little about the astral express. i'd like to start visiting more frequently if the opportunity arises.
now that you've had your fun, it'd be wise to leave before it's too late. the music of the harmony doesn't tolerate discord.
when ayato approached me about holding the test of courage event, it dawned on me that this would be the perfect opportunity to help chizuru face her problem.
you scared me! wh--where... are you now?
now that we've taken up the mantle, we can't afford to fail them.
hmm? have you finished exploring the festival?
i have deep respect for my mother, but she's no longer how i remember her. perhaps i never realized who she truly was...
hey, stop blaming others! didn't you lose to me, too?
i--i'd like to get your opinion on something, as a senior knight!
well, it's not often we have the chance to chat. i'm sure you must have a lot of questions?
i like to go to the library on the weekend and take out some... literature. then when we're finished reading, me and my friends meet up to discuss it.
good morning! is work going well today, master diviner?
...also, those who sacrificed their lives in the war against the invaders seven hundred years ago...
also, don't mind pom-pom's antics. they're actually pretty interested in you. it's just that we haven't had new passengers on the express for a long while.
if you are willing to return what is mine, i will refund all the money you spent in the auction today.
great. then let me lay down the ground rules.
i'm not an elder. i was just being a bit sentimental.
so how about it? wanna help me out?
...okay, miss bronya.
my mother... she tried to force the voice of the stellaron into my head... it was a terrible feeling. i don't know what would've happened if you hadn't shown up.
mm, my thoughts exactly. but we need to be discreet. if they realize we're onto them, then we will lose the element of surprise.
however, this matter is somewhat complicated and may be difficult to explain. let me start with the raiden gokaden.
oh. um, thanks. i... never mind, it's nothing.
the nature of their day-to-day work is highly sensitive and confidential, so whomever i ask to fill in needs to be someone i can trust, and who doesn't have a conflict of interest.
i just hope that if a disaster such as the stellaron crisis were to happen again, we'd all be prepared for it.
...have we met somewhere before?
only to mom. you know i still don't get along with dad.
...th--the sampo hotel? this is goethe hotel!
i was wondering, madam herta, why did you become a championship contender?
haha. of course it did. that's because i didn't come here to sell my things.
kuroda? what are you doing here?
to put it bluntly, it was constant torture with no end in sight.
i heard that! i said i was treating. how could i be rattled by something as mundane as mora!?
this is the astral express, i repeat, this is the astral express. we have arrived in xianzhou territory. requesting landing permission from ground control... f--from the bridge, i mean.
in that case, i hope you don't mind if i stack all the star maps i bought over here.
wait. hold on a sec. this is the first time i'm hearing about this "certain person"... who are you chasing, and why would that lead you to the express?
...but there is one thing she intentionally left out: not all worlds that have accepted the ipc's terms have been saved.
as a guest from afar, there's no need to be so formal.
i never expected the corporation to know anything about aether copying tech! i thought that was something only punklordian hackers could handle.
in accordance with my wishes, the shogun did her best to create an eternal nation. a nation that, in theory, should remain entirely unchanged over time.
baseball bat ninja, your photo ninjutsu is exquisite!
thank you. the cozy furnishings and peaceful atmosphere on the express put me at ease.
you see, everything is possible in this land of dreams. the nightmarish past will disperse and fade away like bubbles in water, and the future that you don't want to face will never come.
you can probably guess from the name that the history-culture hall houses artifacts, replicas, and documents that are of great historical significance to belobog.
(his villain friends must have been waiting on the other side to buy the stellaron. he went to meet them.)
ugh, the culprit is still hiding in the shadows. can't we find even one lead?
although i have some understanding of the situation already, it could take an unexpected turn at any time.
...the principle behind this machine and the one you fixed when you first came to the workshop is the same. you'll understand when you see it.
oh! sorry, sorry, i got carried away.
it must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
geez, did you join the antimatter legion when i wasn't looking?
...the stage is set, this is our moment.
yes. inazuma was facing many great crises at that time. some were local in origin, while others... others came from the now-fallen kingdom of khaenri'ah.
it's just two hundred... but i never bring my coin purse with me on a mission.
thank you. alright here it is -- i've always thought it would be fun to recapture what life was like before i joined the liyue qixing.
okay, okay, the three of us then! sometimes, paimon offers an insightful perspective that can be very helpful to me.
rest? but... *sigh* ...i've still got so much work to do.
why hello... if it isn't the triumphant traveler. and why might you be visiting the shrine? a sign of piety, perhaps?
you need the encryption key, right? which captain should i bother then?
you're right, we've had a long day. let's just get some rest and forget about them.
himeko really knows how to convince people. hehe, between leviathan fossils and the wardance, the latter definitely sounds more fun.
this... this is the dearest treasure of the dazzling ninja school. we cannot do that...
oh, alright, alright. then tell me, when did your brother spar with domon's disciple?
go ahead and give it a try, little layla. don't worry, the little ones and i will be here to keep you safe.
right! why waste your time?
there's also "a guide to tavern chat," and "shortcuts to love"...
well, yeah, i mean, that's why our name is on the event. it's well-known throughout inazuma.
ugh, what am i talking about this for? way to get everyone down, huh.
because this is the only way you can uncover a secret that is even more unspeakable than the serial murders...
your home, family, friends, emotions, what you love and what you despise...
we've collected all three passes now -- that should mean we've solved all the puzzles in the victory zone.
thank you, master. this is... my greatest honor.
from now on, everything about this tournament will be up to these two to decide. and after all the experience they've gained, i'm sure they are more than up to the task.
you all are great storytellers!
don't know. my grandpa didn't know the specifics, and you've seen how wary baizhu is around me. he'd never tell me anything...
(uh-oh! his only escape is...)
whoa... the express is going to be much livelier now. but miss black swan, you'd better not use your memokeeper abilities to pull any pranks!
if we do find it, that's a big win for us! and if we don't, maybe we can still find something that could be used as a substitute.
i don't know her real name, but she calls herself gossipmonger....
i like hanging out with you. and the fact that you're here with me proves that you like hanging out with me too!
oh... okay, back to mondstadt it is! time for today's training to officially begin!
...some may envy this kind of life, but i have felt... trapped. when every choice and every goal has already been made for you... you probably can't imagine how that feels.
okay then. once it's ready, let's take it over to mister cyrus.
perhaps, we can think of another way?
at the guizhong ballista, yes?
walking the same path over and over will never be the same, there will always be something new. that's the meaning of trailblazing.
this guitar... was actually given to me as a birthday present by cocolia a long time ago.
it's been sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust for far too long. but now i've finally got the chance to wear it!
ah, finding treasure is pretty exhilarating!
wow... this place is really lively...
he's one of our old customers. he came back to inazuma from the outside world not long ago. while he was smuggling himself in, the tenryou commission found him and put out a warrant for his arrest...
these factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. it would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.
i'm sure this all sounds utterly bizarre to you, but to me at least, my mother's behavior is completely understandable.
they let you take part!? when did this place last have an inspection!
if you don't want anyone else to know, we'll definitely keep it a secret!
so, i believe that this year calls for a celebration of particular magnificence, something that would be closer to the hearts of every citizen.
*sigh* it's really quite frustrating. lately, my scryglass has been acting up whenever something major occurs.
*sigh* how do you crash into someone in space...
okay, we're done with chapter one. let's move on to chapter two.
that's just sophistry. if that were true, then only the powerful would have the right to determine the future.
that little girl heading into the fragmentum all by herself... it doesn't bear thinking about.
a planet covered in snow and ice... will i find my answer here...?
i was just strolling nearby when i noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
i--i was worried that it might be too... presumptuous to ask...
isn't this fight way off from the actual storyline?
seriously, i've never seen the luofu so lively before.
seriously!? you actually speak trotter?
it looks so... lame.
in this vast universe, there's bound to be someone who can heal your eyes. i'll find them. but until then...
if you don't drink alcohol, that's fine too. there are all kinds of fruit juices covering the whole price spectrum.
you don't have to confirm it with me. just choose one and take it.
now we just need to find all the malfunctioning robots and retrieve the sculpture pieces one by one.
this way, we won't be indebted to each other.
who would have imagined that i would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? ...no, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
it's dark out, so i'm going to accompany xiangling, xingqiu, and chongyun back home. as for the rest of the guests, i'll leave them to our consultant.
hmm... well, as long as i have been able to help you with your creative process...
ah, it's you two. it's been a while.
perhaps...? fair enough, it's tough racking your brains all the time -- i'm struggling to keep track...
no. but what she wanted wasn't my answer either.
knowing that it has your seal of approval makes me feel much more self-confident.
thank you for your guidance. with your assistance, i am gaining a more thorough understanding of my capabilities.
let's store the boat here for now, then. i'll fill sakujirou in when i get back, he'll need to make some preparations before setting sail.
uh... what's going on?
but let's not get hung up about that. the good news is, i've found something else out.
any last words before the duel begins?
sure. but... until then, make sure you take good care of your sword. if i ever manage to steal it one day, your life will also be in my hands.
uh, ahem, i mean... what can he do exactly? are we gonna set him loose on kafka?
that being said, opening a bar in this place... filled with monsters... is quite a feat. siobhan must have a lot of tricks up her sleeve, right?
with so many people rooting for me, i'm sure the match will be over before i can say "hyu!"
alright then. don't worry, it'll all be fine. i'll be right back.
oh wow, look who it is! are you here to hang out with everyone's favorite funeral director?
conductor... of the express?
aha! what if... baizhu knew i'd be on the lookout for her, and hid her away in advance?
i need some time to rally all the residents in the city... and then i'll meet with topaz again.
everyone else has also returned from the dreamscape. himeko and the rest are at the lobby discussing matters with the general. now that you're awake, we should tell the crew that you're all right. come with me!
if i didn't take them seriously, i wouldn't be a reliable maid.
i accept your challenge, hoolay. because the very moment you stepped aboard the skysplitter, you stepped onto your path to ruin.
is that not a good bargain, exchanging it for the one at the core of the plan?
i'd like you to try some authentic inazuma matcha and tell me what you think!
is this lady... your friend too?
but that's the magic of a smile. if you don't believe me, try it. look at it a few times every day, and you'll understand.
ah... *yawns* good morning. the morning air is the freshest. come on, take a few extra breaths -- it'll make you smarter~
thanks a lot for that!
i have never experienced a test of courage event, so i don't really know what to expect.
hm? why is there a crowd blocking the way?
no, not this frame. it's the one surrounded by puppets.
huh? what's this... did those guys leave it behind...?
haha, dan heng's not icy. he's nerdy.
you bring honor to the title of "guardian of eternity."
you don't really think i'm dumb, do you?
and then there's "eating well in mondstadt"... i never realized there were so many ways to cook in the wild.
haha, that's a great idea! i'm almost tempted to increase my budget now...
traveler, paimon. so here you are.
don't forget, kujou sara is also carrying out the vision hunt decree. she obeys the orders of the raiden shogun without question.
thank you, traveler. i am glad you are able to help. keqing can be a tough nut to crack, sometimes.
klee, you're super adorable, and your hat and backpack are the cutest! did your mom get them for you?
well, not really. i just don't know where i am.
we talked about a lot of things -- how she repaired the express, all about her adventures, a certain resident fluffy conductor, and you guys...
...huh? why do you look so excited?
i'm not entirely sure what it all means. maybe mister gallagher can shed some light on it?
after all those millennia... is this what jarilo-vi has become?
oh, i'm afraid this is all i had time for...
...wow, that's a pretty convincing argument...
i held ayaka's hand and we counted down together... three, two, one... and then, "splash!" we were beneath the waves.
well, although there's nothing left to disturb us, and we can finally kick back and enjoy our vacation, we still ought to be cautious while we're on these islands.
ugh, there he goes again! enough with the pleasantries. go let our guest take a seat.
change will come to inazuma, and with it, new possibilities. this will take time, but eventually, the future will bring healing to the scars of the past.
maybe you're right. mondstadt is symbolized by the wind... but my vision is a geo one.
ah, you must be thinking of sampo, right? i don't think so, our people have been keeping a close eye on him these days. the reports say he's been on his best behavior - not the slightest hint of trouble-making.
looks like some kind of antique? but who'd want to hold on to something like this...
i get it, serval. after all, you and mother...
the only thing is... there's so much to get through. will i really be able to finish them all?
therefore, the almighty shogun would send one of her familiars as an emissary to the martial artist, who would then provide assistance and protection in the fight against the shogun.
master kucha, have i... done something wrong?
...*sigh* we need to work on your emotional intelligence.
greed, a lust for wealth, and impatience can all cloud your judgment.
buuuut it's already getting late... how about we head back to goethe hotel for a bit and then set out on the express tomorrow?
we are both warriors, and the dialogue we must now have shall be conducted by the blade alone.
the story behind this guitar... huh, it'll take a while to tell.
i did say this is what "we're" going to do. i trust that the word "teamwork" is in your vocabulary.
more importantly... i hope that, between the two of us, we need not be concerned with our identities...
wait a minute, was that gepard's plan all along? use guilt to make me stay!?
i need a change of mood, and a change of clothes will facilitate that.
more fixing? i'm getting good at this!
yes. how can i maintain a proper astrologist's mentality if i stay with all these philistines?
alright, go and take a look around. there should be a mechanism somewhere that makes the whole room move.
huh? but... what about the savage monsters...?
do you wish to know the truth about the shooting stars at night? haha, they are but fleeting moments of luminosity. uh, you used to be one of them? are you a tengu warrior?
oh no! silly me, i almost forgot something super important!
yep. oh! once we find it, you should come with us!
*sigh* it's tragic... such wholehearted devotion, rendered meaningless by circumstance. have you been kept in the dark? or are you the only one left in the light?
leave this realm, and rise as you would on any other day. forget this fortuitous encounter, and return whence you came.
dislike? we were like sisters once -- inseparable. of course, that was all before she became the supreme guardian...
that's why i told them we were here for urgent maintenance! the front line equipment needs servicing just as much as the rest.
(and so luocha has to make a break for it! but where to? lemme have a look at the map... aha, gotcha!)
*sigh* serval's rule is: no rules.
mister giovanni... again? what's he up to this time?
with one more person around, we'll be able to have some variety in our chess games. i hope that that would be less of a bore to you.
the interastral peace corporation is a good example: they worship qlipoth, the aeon of preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
in all of belobog, you won't find anyone who speaks more elegantly or acts more like a leader than lady bronya.
it's my honor to meet you, general huaiyan...
...just thinking about it makes me feel more motivated than ever!
...sorry, hardly the time for me to be obsessing over all this.
no, i won't let that happen.
what's with all the people gathered around? what happened?
yes, i heard all that! i mean something she did herself.
i will leave the tenryou and yashiro commissions to handle the follow-up work, such as investigating the origins of this incident and tending to the root system.
this swing is covered in dust... hey, don't sit on it! it's filthy!
(they are still a ball of fire as ever.)
but what about the rest...?
i will -- and yes, we should. i'll hold you to that.
may death be the end of your boundless dream...
check out the items up for bidding and see if there's anything you might be interested in.
(hmm... seems bribing isn't an option.)
i think so too. but could you imagine having to hear names like "the traitorous ruler" for the rest of your life?
hmph! didn't think you'd accuse me of goofing off... never mind the gift i got for you then...
makoto never saw me as a fearless weapon. likewise, i should not regard you as a mere tool.
of course i do. it was never my intention to place control of inazuma into anybody else's hands.
greetings. who might you be?
but... i know that she's often looking for small talk with quinn...
i started preparing for this a long time ago.
you're a fast learner. in short, this is the last chance to get inazuma back on track. otherwise, an eternity of darkness awaits.
excuse me! we're looking for a child in a wheelchair...
on the contrary, it's the duty of the knights to look after any visitors traveling to and from mondstadt.
film! did you hear that? that film he mentioned must be the same one that was stolen from the museum.
as a guuji, there's one thing i know very well: people believe whatever they want to believe. some things you do not see, simply because you do not wish to look.
then prepare ourselves for our next trailblazing destination.
morning. you look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? what mischief were you up to last night, hmm?
i couldn't help but feel a little concerned, so i just came to see how everything is going.
hmm? oh, i'm okay! though i must say...
i never had the chance to receive a good education as a child. that's why i hope to teach these children myself. hopefully i can pass on some of what i have learned.
do i have the wrong wing... or even the wrong block? i'm sorry, this hotel is huge, and the hallways all look the same. it's easy to get lost in here...
but... as a maid, i'm only authorized to deal with smaller tasks.
are things that my mother wished to try, yes.
miss marjorie, here. we found your monocle.
normally, i have to make a special request to the chef if i want it to taste like this.
ahh... what a mess! i really want a nice cool drink of soda to help me calm down...
oh, zhongli? he took one of those fancy meal boxes and set off for the mountains. said he wanted to pay a visit to some old friends.
so this is the honorary knight's training method, right? i must try it!
absolutely not! don't worry, ma'am -- i will protect those manuscripts with my life!
hehe, that sounds great. i'm looking forward to it.
...careful, there are some strange things on the wall... and they don't look like they're from the dreamjolt troupe...
ahem, speaking of good sides with sake, i personally prefer fried tofu...
okay, let's get started.
still, whatever a rose means...
where's this anger coming from?
my question was in jest, but since you answered it in earnest, please stay true to your word.
are you dealing with attacks like this every day?
oh, really? come, come, lend me your ear so i can tell you a secret.
spontaneity is the best choice to make here! um, let's use this incense burner on the table.
and whenever i think of this, i feel something stirring within musou isshin.
marjorie's monocle has gone missing from her shop. we're trying to look for clues...
although your tail isn't professionally maintained, the fur doesn't look dry and coarse. to me, this says you like to take care of it.
madam cocolia, it is my firm belief that the visitors from beyond the sky are not the villains we had imagined before.
it's the realm within a dream bubble. this was left to the astral express by a nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
if the nihility represents the primal fear of life, rendering any lofty convictions insignificant under their imposing shadow...
himeko and mister yang still have to participate in social networking. being an adult sure is hard.
no, she didn't want to talk about that, and i didn't ask. i get the feeling that it'll bring up some unhappy memories.
even worse. if you find one cockroach on the express, it usually means...
i summed up my culinary requirements in four words. is that insufficiently simple for you?
one of the problems i want to solve is tackling the heating issue without exhausting geomarrow reserves. i've discussed this with serval -- she'll be the one responsible for handling this matter in future...
at that time, i couldn't imagine that one day i would be able to experience all these foreign places. but now, all those wishes that were once impossible don't seem so far out of reach.
what have you been doing at night instead of sleeping?
huh? is it for me? thank you, klee!
you said external forces might be messing with my head, right? that just makes me more curious. hmph, no one gets away with locking up my memories! let's go. i'll show you the way to goethe hotel!
but if i can't perform well in an exam, what good is my ability...
anyway, if you're trying to bully this young lady, you'd better watch out for the weapon in my hand!
hehe, i was excited the first time i experienced a warp jump, too. but i'm used to it now.
so you guys aren't that close after all? i thought you were sworn friends.
*sigh* one qiqi was enough of a conundrum, the last thing i need's another one... if i'd known this was coming, i'd have whisked him off to the wangsheng funeral parlor the moment i found him...
i'm not sad. it's just that... this dream is so loving and forgiving.
shh! don't let anyone else see us! i still want it to be a surprise!
be serious! i really wanna know...
i'm good, everything seems normal...
general jing yuan?
yes, providing the question pertains to something i am knowledgeable about.
if people of the past deserved the gods' attention, then so do the people of the future.
nobody sets off a firework to feel lonely, do they...
...that won't do. even a survey requires rigorous methodology, let alone an investigation.
well, this chance won't come often, and we do have a tea set. perhaps i should try my hand at making us a pot of tea.
i still have somewhere that i'd like to visit.
yes. as well-versed in astrology as she was, my master knew only astrology. alice, on the other hand, was skilled in a great many other mystical fields.
why, this is the most exciting sub-plot of the novel: the secret investigation. i'm sure you must be curious about where the magical powers of the wisdom orb and floral jelly really come from?
card backs? you mean like the kind with a treasure chest design on it?
even if you wish for it... i can't promise you anything.
if you're second-guessing how you look, you can forget about looking glamorous -- even the finest garments in the world will look out of place on you.
a single slash of a blade... isn't really accurate. it was actually two blades, just that the second one was faster.
open this door... take a look at the mesmerizing dreamscape, while you can still remember.
oho, i've never heard of a demon that boring before.
wh--what...? ah! you're so annoying! stop scaring me!
hey, don't rush her! so sorry, miss jingyan, they can be a little impatient. take your time, we can wait.
i think we're going to have a difficult time trying to rein in its popularity while it's the only work in its league on the market.
fiendlings, be gone! super brilliant enlightenment!
the result has invariably been that they "can't".
thank you for doing this. you... are also someone i want to protect.
actually, i have another selfish motive... i want to prove to cocolia that i was right. once we've taken care of the stellaron... maybe she'll go back to how she was.
...hold on... if the watchmaker really was a nameless, wouldn't that make him your predecessor? would you like to take a picture with him?
...and before you ask, no, i don't have any of that ice lying around.
one of them is yanqing, the boy we've all met before. the other is yunli, the granddaughter of general huaiyan from the xianzhou zhuming.
you are indeed.. ...dreaming.
thanks for your input. i'll make a note of your opinion.
i do believe he was prepared for that outcome. i could see it in his eyes.
really? then the next time we meet, i'll bring some fireworks for us to launch together! it'll be fun!
belobog, here we come!
remember when i mentioned that the cloud knights blocked all relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing happened? stargazer navalia is not under lockdown.
this crate looks promising. maybe there are spare stove components inside...
gamblers always place their bets on the next dice roll... but the bankers always have the last laugh, and they never touch a single die.
oh? you sure know a lot, captain beidou.
oh, paimon, you're just as carefree and enthusiastic as ever. well, it's about time for me to get into character. as a contestant, i need to go and get ready for the tournament...
...these are much more practical in nature! and of course, there are even books that focus on theories of love!
hi, ellin! i was just asking the honorary knight for training advice.
but i have experienced it all. that is why i have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
this is science! don't get distracted! *deep breath* focus.
...and i hope that you can all witness it with me.
we are putting our dearest baby sister in your hands this time. let us know immediately if anything happens.
hee-hee, i've got to make sure it sounds suitably mysterious...
darn, i wanted to see one...
good morning. did you sleep well?
why don't we try using the lamps' heat-transferring properties?
stop! all of you! put down your weapons!
why is that surprising? playing cards is an ancient form of entertainment, and i was curious to see what card games are like in this day and age.
hmph, you saw right through me. why else would i be standing here today?
...what!? that run-of-the-mill, huh?
by the way, i heard you were the winners. impressive! i eventually found the hidden dango milk too, but it was already too late.
i also have you to thank. the things we experienced out on the streets and the photo you took of me, they helped me come to this realization, too.
pom-pom and i are more than capable of looking after the express.
i'm hu tao, the current director of the wangsheng funeral parlor, responsible for... well, trifling matters having to do with mortality.
understood. alright then, don't you worry! i will lend you a hand.
but there's a premise to every legend, and that's belief!
hmm... choose your words wisely, geppie...
you just want us to buy your things! this is extortion!
uh... you drew the amber lord's gaze? right at that moment? that's too much of a coincidence...
no one knows what he did after he left jarilo-vi, and why he decided to come back.
perhaps that man is just an exception. let's not jump to conclusions. we should experience the dreamscape ourselves, just as i did at dreamflux reef.
the last time i saw her, she was preparing to meet someone on the snow plains. she even asked for a stove set from me...
let's press on. we can't activate either of these terminals, so let's look for the energy supply installation itself.
i was perfectly calm until she volunteered to help...
but you're right, i haven't had much real-world fighting experience... where can i get some?
when we first met, i was in a hurry. we didn't have a chance to sit down and have a proper chat.
maybe on an uninhabited island or in a quiet rainforest, just somewhere we can put work aside and relax for a bit.
the stellaron was sealed while you were sleeping. the ordinary people in penacony have no idea what happened. they just feel like something is missing from their memories.
however, their target is not the ordinary guests, but the ambassadors of the ipc. the family will certainly ensure that the safety of the guests is of the highest importance.
liyue harbor is very inclusive. as long as you respect the rules here, you will not be turned away.
no need for the melodrama. that was still a magical performance...
at this very moment, there is only one dream encompassing the entire asdana system.
ugh, read the room! enough with the mean jokes!
even though it has suffered fragmentum corrosion, this is still part of belobog. it was our home. the guards know this place like the back of their hand.
us silvermane guards have fought against the fragmentum for far too long and have lost too much... even though you've solved the stellaron problem for now, the number of casualties is still staggering.
that's right -- as long as we pose a threat to the stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
an amicassador's seal, a small box... a knife? a bow, and something wrapped up tight... i wonder what this is.
if i don't review my mistakes, i will only repeat them the next time i run into the same problem...
aiya, c'mon! can't you take a joke!?
everyone at wangshu inn is one of ours.
you've done me a huge favor by defending the space station from the antimatter legion. and know that while herta may not admit it, she owes me one. and she will not refuse me if i ask for a favor in return...
hee-hee! i love it, better than all that lifeless brochure stuff. we want people to feel warm and fuzzy.
enough cat and mouse -- drop your weapons and come with me.
wow, they smell so good! they look so crispy and crunchy! i think i'm in love!
right? i don't think it's fair for you to carry the weight alone. why not discuss it with others first?
oh... oh, i understand!
astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.
(no, it's not the best time to do that...)
you're right... but when people have nothing to rely on, they always seek out things to find comfort in.
everyone, could you all take a break in the next car? don't worry, i'll stay here with pom-pom.
don't apologize, get to know us! we've got a new sale going on.
surely... you aren't planning to turn a blind eye to them?
we swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the ipc, and then off we went on our adventure together... we're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.
ah!? who would do such a horrible mean thing!?
anyway, would ya like to pair up with me? we'd be an amazing team! with us working together, the second round will be a piece of cake.
use of force here is strictly forbidden. before you proceed, which of you would like to face criminal charges for dishonoring the shogun, hmm?
grandpa? do you mean... you're the watchmaker's grandson?
come onnnn! himeko and mister yang are grown-ups -- i'm sure they'll cope without us for one night.
well, you know, my "script" isn't over yet.
i see, sorry for taking up your time.
the conditions here are so... rudimentary. i wonder how long those people have been living here...
from her heart, avin brought forth urstone glasses. we found meteors that flew up from the earth, and we even became one with the shooting stars themselves...
oh right -- march and dan heng should both be in their rooms right now.
my bow... but himeko made that for me! you're lying...
i feel like going back to reality and resting too... come on, let's say goodbye at golden hour.
hi, we meet again... what i mean is, it's nice to see you. just call me firefly, as always.
...as said previously, rex lapis' soul returning to the heavens is the end of the contract, and it is also the end of an era.
yes, i understand. i will go back and search for the diagram. please come meet me at the kamisato estate later.
every child in belobog should visit this exhibit at least once... no, once isn't nearly enough.
however, it appears that sunday aims to convey the spiritual plight of the prisoners more than the physical aspects of imprisonment.
so, are we to just abandon the notion of progress... for the sake of wishful thinking?
when i read about the knights of favonius and the millelith in books, their rules and philosophies seem so different...
because i blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.
...this cannot happen. i must go and rescue him!
i'd heard about what happened to the xianzhou alliance. but as far as i'm aware, the family hasn't faced any such external interventions. who knows, perhaps i've just been away too long and missed something.
and what would a festival be without me? i'll be sure to go have a look, too.
this is a gift from miss yancui on behalf of all the restaurants on aurum alley. you are going to love this.
the parts related to you are only a small portion of the collection...
if you ask me, i'd say you're having a mid-life crisis. you're getting to be around that age, after all.
...i just want to be clear in myself, first. these fragments of history, the teachings i studied... it's all muddled together in my mind... i just... i don't know what i should believe.
i would very much like to travel across the seven nations... and see how people live.
so, your first possession, hmm? what was it like?
i think it's rather good. a lot of people still like the classic hero's journey. from ordinary soldier to great leader -- a fresh take on a timeless classic.
and your masters, the kujou clan of the tenryou commission -- they are the ones keeping the truth from reaching the shogun.
thank you. i hope the next time i come i won't disturb anyone.
...sound promising! i'll meet you in the underworld, then.
the yuheng... she has changed a lot recently. but is liyue better off with the yuheng we have now, or the yuheng we used to know? only time will tell.
fiendling chief... you're behind all of this, aren't you?
that's strange... how did paimon transform into a lavender melon?
now then. the schedule. let's see what you have for me today.
hehe, okay... thanks for the compliment, i guess. may i ask, with whom do we have the pleasure of speaking?
um... i guess it's because the animation has a retro style.
liyue is due another paper snowstorm. this time, you will be the one to change the prevailing weather.
see, there's a piece of paper here! it says "penya sergeyevna"...
and if i'm guessing correctly, there should be some sort of core meteorite among the bunch, within which is a crystal that harbors leonard's spirit.
allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a xianzhou ship that dan heng spent time on? that's gotta be fate! i wonder what dan heng stories await us.
before i'm able to fight alongside you, honorary knight...
yes. otherwise, the victims will never wake up... this core is the root cause of everything that has happened.
oh please, it's the result that counts~ gotta take risks sometimes if you wanna succeed~
indeed. i'm afraid it's almost as difficult as resurrecting an aeon...
phantylia... what is she doing?
"take your seat, present your answers, and you shall reach enlightenment."
ahhhh. there's nothing like dessert for improving one's mood. much more enjoyable than meditating alone all the time.
even if an antique is priceless, the happiness it brings lasts for only the moment that you obtain it.
so as a senior knight... this is your suggestion?
traveler, paimon -- let's try our luck at the international trade association.
the workers here are very skilled, so i like to come to them when i need something custom-made.
agh, enough apologizing. my ears can't take any more.
i know every individual word in these books' titles. so why is it that they make no sense to me in these particular combinations?
well, obviously, being the fabulously beautiful fox that i am, it wasn't long before the little girl was crazy about me.
yes, that's it. i'm not making excuses. it's the truth.
since you've made it yourself, i guess having a little taste is the least i can do, haha...
but as the victor, i acknowledge your honor
i'd be perfectly happy with that -- i'm just worried that captain beidou's business might be negatively affected.
because... aren't we supposed to be inside a dream? how could someone die in a beautiful dreamscape like this... shouldn't only good things happen here?
initially, i thought this might just be another case of a merchant hoarding goods in hopes of maximizing their profits. but once i heard more, i realized it must be the thief you are after.
whatever you do, don't get all worked up over nothing, okay? or else by the time we're out, i'll have to erase your memories.
hey, march. that's a big smile on your face -- what's the good news?
these days i just spend my time fixing things in this workshop and playing music. it's a pretty carefree existence.
even after all this time, being by her side makes me feel like a young fox again... perhaps it's because she's become more affectionate with age?
then, persikov went searching for the soldiers who had gone mad and strayed from the group, and took them to a hidden cave.
i wasn't expecting that either, but the assistananas insist i'm a great talent. they even gave me a membership card with a high level of clearance...
every piece of the jade chamber, from the stone walls and wooden beams down to the smallest ornament, contributed to its total weight.
after all, it is a grand event held by the family. the guestlist could be a lot longer than we imagine.
seele is still new to the vastness of the overworld -- she feels uncomfortable in a big crowd... i'll help her adjust to life here.
satelleden... so everything in the tale series is true...
what i'd like to know... is pom-pom a rabbit that learned to speak...? or a person that was turned into a rabbit?
it's important to learn to enjoy the simple pleasures in life. you might discover a new interest if you just give it a try.
unfortunately, it didn't stop there. from the early days of our journey into asdana, we were already affected by the stellaron. that strange dreamscape where we met... maybe it was a sign that your thoughts were beginning to drift away.
i... get it. being cautious around a stellaron hunter isn't a bad thing.
i'll be in the crowd, cheering you on. remember to give it your all, and most importantly -- have fun!
hehe. before you get too indignant, consider the fact that your concerns sound every bit as nonsensical to me as that blatant lie did to you.
you still don't remember? what about "findie"? that's one of their products... oh and the interastral peace broadcast! y'know, the one always being played on the express!
so what does he want us to take a look at?
if you are in need of mora, you should absolutely consider doing business.
once i meet that successor and have a chance to exchange knowledge with them, i should be able to read your fate more accurately.
that is of no concern. this is my recuperation state.
let's see... "hymn of the holy land"? i've never heard of a book by that title.
i'm much too busy with my research these days to dedicate time to a competition. besides, even if i did enter, there's no guarantee i'd actually win a prize, is there?
yes, that's exactly what i'm saying.
guys... does this place feel weird to you? it feels like... like there are loads of eyes staring at us.
with gears and wisdom back, the industrial hall can reopen to the public.
legend has it that there were five poets in ancient inazuma who were supremely gifted in singing and writing poetry. they are known as "the five kasen."
doesn't seem like there's any way to open this gate... ooh, check this mechanism out. look familiar?
as for what has triggered this change, i believe it must be the loss of his vision. for to be stripped of one's vision is to be stripped of one's ambition.
lynxy is one of my... uh, lynx is one of my... ahem! lynx is... one of belobog's number one researchers, and... one of my best besties!
picking up people on the road who appear vulnerable, robbing them blind once they've gotten on the cart, and then taking them to some archon-forsaken place -- is that your deal?
looks like they're not going to cooperate. but, they did at least tell us that the captain is at dream's edge...
nightfall has arrived. i will soon be able to begin my divination. ah... did i finish writing my astrology column last night...?
these techniques are all a crucial element of living a disciplined life. they are the result of refinement of the objective laws of the world.
it is as if we have returned to the moment when the laws of eternity were first established. your will today is as strong as it was back then.
hmm? sounds suspiciously like a compliment to me. i'll take it!
in return, i give you a blessing from me: good luck. i'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.
besides, it'll only be for a short while as we dine together. there won't be any lasting consequences.
bingo! except, i don't think you need to have a sweet dish for it to be a complete meal. personally, i always skip dessert.
...do you think the great mine was affected by our fighting on the surface?
i'm sorry, mister cyrus. but i'm afraid that my answer is still--
why... why didn't i remember this until now? my childhood memories are so blurry...
the value of items housed here can't be measured in money alone... but this little piece of stone could fetch a mountain of cash.
it seems like i've underestimated the popularity of this game. hmm... i suppose this calls for a few more volumes of "king of invokations"...
her body may have perished, but she became the sacred sakura. this, too, is a form of eternity.
who exactly you are escapes me, but you seem familiar to me.
sure, i'll keep an eye out. there's tons of options at oti mall. do you think she'll like trinkets like... hair accessories or brooches?
okay, okay, i--i'm counting on you!
inazuma today is completely different from how it was in the past. if i can see this meteor shower, i'm sure i'll be able to come up with a new kind of firework.
that's a very thoma-sounding suggestion...
i've never met anyone who was willing to talk. i could only stand at the crossroads, watching crowds of people hurrying like the wind through the jungle of steel, only to deposit the alfalfa credits that they'd earned into the bank's vault.
that's your big reveal? the important part is: we're from a different planet!
whoa, then you must be pretty tired after work every day, right? i mean, you have to swim all that way just to go home.
i know she's used to going into the snow plains alone for research, and we've always believed she can protect herself...
don't worry. i'm not here for you. i'm here to find march and discuss some... opinions about books, and i brought you a small gift. here. don't misunderstand. i'm definitely not here for you.
(hey! you don't know if you don't try!)
let's do this. i may never have come face to face with it, but this stellaron cost me a nice, stable job. it's time to get even.
nay, dinosaur fiendling. your feeble sorcery stands no chance against my dazzling ninjutsu!
...what? how is that possible? i need a moment to wrap my head around this...
well, life and death, jiaoqiu, it's all predetermined.
the museum is packed these days -- i've never seen it so full of visitors. you run a tight ship here.
whoa... this atmosphere is crazy!
haha, you don't need a jade abacus to get a feel for sampo...
such things are elementary for an astrologist.
everyone on the express is a passenger.
do you think we can trust rappa?
as long as i'm not busy, you're welcome any time!
huh? what would i need that kind of ability for? i'm no doctor.
i guess not! eagle sounds about right.
these puppets... where are they guiding us this time?
that resentment turned into a pestilence spreading amongst the ordinary folk. hysteric people mistook it for "the curse of the gods."
no, i said "top," not "mop"! you know, thoma even sent us some wine from his homeland not too long ago.
it's, um... right! you remember how you neglected all those flowers to death? i piled them all over there during a bit of spring cleaning, and now they smell terrible! so... don't go over there!
you may as well come clean. you know i will not turn a blind eye to any violation of the rules in liyue harbor.
...that could be a big issue. i'll have a chat with himeko about it.
in her, i see the fireflies of the forest, dazzling and bewitching, yet shining only for a brief moment.
to be on the safe side, how about we give him the frostening bottle?
otherwise... tens of millions of mora is rather a high price for lunch, even one at liuli pavilion -- wouldn't you say?
hah -- and who do you think were the inspiration for the tea society? us, that's who.
it's alright, don't worry. there just seems to be some kind of misunderstanding here. why don't you take this opportunity to clear it up? don't you think that'd be best?
liuli pavilion or xinyue kiosk. which would you prefer to go to for lunch?
sounds like you know a few things about art yourself, thoma.
you must have been blaming yourself all this time. you knew kamai and the samurai became friends as a result of akitsu haz{ruby#[s]haneasobi}ura, a game connected to your existence.
let's waste no time and head to the theme park then!
it's a deal then. next time you need something done in the workshop, i'll do it for free!
...this is the approach ei has come up with for realizing eternity.
good food really perks you up, and puts you in the mood to share some stories. ooh, actually i got a good one, you've gotta hear this one...!
well then, as promised, let's start rebuilding the bridge between the overworld and the underworld.
for example, i can foresee the outside world posing a threat to inazuma's businesses. these are the issues that i must work to solve.
in the past, overworld soldiers on the front line would lose their lives in droves, and yet the fragmentum's advance would remain unaffected.
shh... listen to what the people around us are talking about. the conversation has already moved on, hasn't it?
in the hands of a professional businessperson, the kind of information you will be exposed to would be worth... well, tens of millions of mora.
yeah, yeah, i get it.
oooh, not a bad choice. with the commerce guild's young master lighting the incense, we're all sure to make a huge sum of mora in the new year.
i think i'll leave that to the shogun. the greatest threat to eternity is still the erosion that comes with time.
you're saying that the real tingyun is still...
but, qlipoth the preservation... are they not one of the magnificent entities you speak of? is it not their strength... that has sheltered belobog this entire time?
they... set the ice down in one of the passenger cars -- it ended up being my room.
we've got a xianzhou general on our side! this time we have to... wait, does this seem familiar to you? let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!
let's leave the sausages here, i think someone might be missing them if we take them.
what does director topaz think about us having to take on her support squad?
before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
moreover, there were no complaints when people thought that outfits from popular works would make an appearance in the exhibition match. on the contrary, everyone seemed to think it was a special surprise.
can you identify the people who left these footprints?
since i do rock 'n' roll full-time, i'd say my hobby is... work? what's wrong with that?
...i have recorded all the clues you provided, mister limestein. thank you for putting your trust in the silvermane guards. we will keep you informed if there are any developments in the investigation.
it's just a few cards, honestly...
i had some spare time, so i decided to come out for a stroll. oh, did you buy this figurine yourself?
oh, that~ it's a botanical specimen -- little lynxy sent it during one of her research trips.
boothill? what is he doing here?
being able to live in such a wonderful place without having to pay rent... am i dreaming?
where's the input interface? ah, found it...
hmm... sounds like you know a lot about him?
the fiendling chief left atop this ninja tech bullet! let us quickly give chase!
it's not that i "know everything." it's just that i've been in your position before.
when i think back on all my hard work in the past, it motivates me to face the challenges that lie ahead in the future.
*sigh* would you be at all interested in checking out an inazuman festival?
or to put it another way, they were all people who have had a taste of something that was mine and convinced themselves that i am someone to be taken advantage of.
so, this building in the dream bubble is your childhood "home."
astral friends, i have an idea. but for it to work, i'll need everyone's cooperation.
i reckon so. in any case, i'd give my disciple a name like this as well, if i were to take one.
my mirage didn't contain any hints on the fatui or the machine... does that mean they had nothing to do with these mirages after all?
then we are in agreement. let's return and inform miss black swan.
not to mention, i might not have registered henning's cry if that weren't the case.
...long ago, i, too, was like you, with irreplaceable companions. we also embarked on journeys, making the best choices we could whenever we could.
oh, uh... your praise is quite unwarranted. i merely did what anyone in my position would have done...
klee, lady guuji is saying that we can print the book if we shrink it to half the size. are you okay with that?
what are you talking about? who's got cold feet?
and ultimately, her eternity is defined by fear... the fear of loss.
it may also be that miss firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
you poor thing! i'll go check the lunar calendar -- today might be unlucky.
"sacrificed herself," huh... sure. yeah. that's the whole story...
*sigh* here we are sweating over our training while she's busy sampling dim sum!
so sorry for bothering you every time...
i'm writing a letter to the astral express. it's been a while, and i thought i should let them know that i'm safe and sound here.
um, won't we stick out if we go in like this?
but i know for a fact that they were not born this way.
it was a long day today. all i need is a hot shower and a good night's sleep.
traveler, if i'm guessing correctly... you were repeating your wishes to yourself in your mind, weren't you?
of course not! what were you thinking?
this is bad news. i don't think sakujirou had enough time to make his mind up...
got any more encouraging words?
you can display it at home or hang it on your wheelchair. it'll cheer you up.
oh, i do! i really do. being born into a family of fireworks makers, i feel like since i was a kid, i've been obsessed with watching things go boom and then seeing all the lights and colors and...
ahahaha... i'm not quite a hero yet.
you know what? time for some fieldwork. maybe the answers to our questions are waiting for us at the scene.
with my words, xinyan's chords, and yun jin as our mentor...
while the nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
*gasp* careful, lynx -- there are monsters coming!
resistance will prove futile. you must come with me.
hehe, you should prepare yourself. i certainly won't go easy on you.
...uhm, nevermind. let's hurry over to the next stage.
i have some preparations to make first. could you bring my clothes to my room, please?
you are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity...
there should be a lamp nearby. inserting a thermic core should do the trick.
mother... you've always known the truth about the stellaron, haven't you? the responsibility of bearing that truth will fall upon me one day. such is the burden of being guardian -- to carry these secrets for eternity.
how should i pose? help me out here. it should look good but not too over the top. this isn't coming naturally to me at all.
i couldn't ask for your help and offer nothing at all in return, so this is my gift to you.
so loud... the voice... it's becoming more shrill...
to reciprocate, in the upcoming confrontation, if the odds aren't in the astral express' favor... i will stand with you.
you should join us too! it'll be a riot. if there's one thing i've learned from being a funeral director, it's how to throw a party!
"guard the border between life and death..." this is wangsheng funeral parlor's most important responsibility. and i'm stricter than most...
whew, this cyber swordplay is amazing...
there's a monster heading this way... what should we do, gepard?
why don't they sell soulglad in this bar? did something happen?
okay, looks like we've learned all the essentials -- let the fun begin!
they once fought against the ancient gods. they fought brilliantly in a battle that engulfed the whole world in darkness. although the gods were defeated in the end, their resentment persevered.
the astral express likely needs room for some internal deliberation. in the meantime, i'll try and locate gallagher.
what i've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the stellaron at a very young age. all the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point...
i'm grateful for your assistance. now, i will leave you here in peace to proceed with your work. i still have a few items from today's schedule that need addressing.
it's not often that the four of us are all together. what should we do next? hide-and-seek, hopscotch, or some shopping?
if we manage to convince her, i'm quite sure we'll be able to get you another audience with the raiden shogun.
hey, don't sweat it. you guys have a tough job, i know how it is. how's the situation looking?
well, kazuha? ready to go one-on-one against liyue's most notorious backstreet poet?
no matter. running into difficulties is part of practicing the craft. i must also become stronger myself in order to convince people.
wait, so that's what you're suggesting?
if she can delegate more resources to the investigation, that should help it move forward faster.
please, don't worry! i... oh! we also have the honorary knight here!
anyway, that's enough chit-chat. time for anti-raiden shogun training phase two.
when there are no acting gigs, i work as a guide near glaux avenue. if you don't mind, i can show you all the exciting things around here! maybe if i do my job as a guide, people will stop suspecting me...
back when i decided to isolate myself in the plane of euthymia, there was no yae publishing house, and certainly no stories of this kind.
although... it is a bit of a hassle with the constant back and forth. if only we could burn 'em by the batch...
i've never seen miss tingyun use anything like that to defend herself... it must be another gift that she never had time to send.
i wouldn't be where i am now. i wouldn't have known that they respond to wishes, and i wouldn't have seen all these beautiful sights in sumeru.
i was just making small talk, never mind the details!
i hope furina will like the gifts we prepared. oh, and if you still think we should get something else for her, just let me know! i should be able to make some fireworks.
so i ask you again. your high bidding price -- was it motivated by trust? or was it greed?
but that's already plain as day to you. and no matter who tells you -- be it me, or herta, or anybody -- it's not the same thing as feeling it yourself.
this is for you, seele. please help me pass it on to the outsiders. if... if i'm unable to see you again... they'll know what to do.
i almost fell asleep waiting.
hey, that's not fair! my eyes are peeled this time -- i'll make a run for it the second things go wrong.
to put it simply, makoto wasn't concerned about outcomes.
however, now that much of the mountains have collapsed, the connection of plants and water veins is blocked.
you want to save the people of inazuma from the vision hunt decree. so do i. the only difference is that i'd rather like to save this nation and save ei while we're at it.
there is a small inn near mt. tianheng that never sees a lot of business, even though its food is always great value for the money.
actually, this whole compound is the family's private property. i asked miss kiminami to prepare some ingredients and utensils for me so that i could cook a special dish here.
i understand. i shall become your shadow, just as you were once makoto's shadow.
are these puppets part of the stage setup? even so, it's so eerie that the entire front hall is empty.
and with the extra time, there are some other matters i wish to attend to...
stop trying to escape. if you believe that you can defeat us, why not settle it once and for all right now!?
well? did you find the answer yet?
later, this puppet wandered inazuma as an ordinary human male with his own consciousness, until... the fatui took an interest in him.
as for what my wish is... hehe, it's a secret for now.
would you mind if i took up a bit more of your time? tell me about the things you like.
well, since my brother is the one who brought up the idea, i suppose there's no need to worry.
wait, so while you seemed to be playing with your phone, you were actually arranging things with moze? are all yaoqing people as quick as you?
yeah, even i was worried that i wouldn't be able to get up! i still felt like i was drifting in the waves when i went to sleep last night.
if possible, i'd like to have your trust.
but before leaving, i'm sure you all have plenty to say to the nameless of the past?
i'm sorry, i didn't intend to hide this... i have to fulfill sam's mission according to the script. that aside... there are my personal motives: i wish to get to know this world as firefly.
then... if the gift doesn't matter, the choices are limitless... i can't decide...
fine, just fine. i went to take part in that steambird panel. it turned out to be more interesting than i expected.
splendid, splendid! now, allow me to compose a poem in loving memory of this dish.
y'know what, you're right -- we should work these things out on our own...
i'll be the taste-tester, of course. you got this!
and speaking of... i heard that it's customary to eat with chopsticks in liyue...
the restricted zone front line is on the other side of the gear bridge. it's an endless fragmentum with a few exhausted silvermane guards... and the stench of death in the air.
who would have thought that human will can survive in the skies for millennia on end...
it's alright, relax. i'm just here to look around. i'm having a change of pace today.
he admitted that a mysterious figure named mister cold feet persuaded him to target the museum exhibits.
the shogun does not make mistakes -- she is incapable of doing so. but i, as ei, would like to offer my apologies.
keeping such a conspicuous piece of art around wouldn't go unnoticed... the thieves must have disassembled it and hidden the parts inside the robots.
clients like these deserve better treatment. taking an interest in their daily lives will ultimately benefit not only them, but also me...
yes. maybe we're already used to bad luck, and we know how to deal with feelings of sorrow and disappointment.
dead-end here too... given the layout of the room, are they really suggesting we maneuver around using the walls?
things are getting weirder, huh? this monkey even has a fan club now. but since we have a way to get into the club, i'll go see what they're up to!
(so what! this is the tea society, remember?)
so you can definitely understand, why we want to be prepared.
life cannot be reset, but the dreamscape allows them to experience another life. so even if they have to pay a price, they would still make this choice.
yes. you were the person who came to mind. we may not have spent a great deal of time together... but i do place a great deal of trust in you.
when you put it like that, it doesn't actually sound too bad.
i just couldn't believe that he never lifted a finger to oppose cocolia's order to seal the passageway...
even while my senses are dulled by sorcery, i can still see the grotesque sins that are unfolding here... how detestable and deplorable indeed.
ahem, i... i mean, i appreciate the compliments... but what's with the flattery all of a sudden?
you and i are the only ones with ambiguous educational qualifications on the express... oh wait, there's pom-pom too.
i'm not quite following, but it sounds impressive, i guess.
still, your idea is very sensible. mora can only lift a weary spirit. it cannot alleviate physical fatigue.
i see, so you had big shots helping you. i guess that won't be of much help to sakujirou.
mm-hmm! oh, we brought you a message from bronya! ahem, "the blockade will soon be lifted. the people of the underworld will breathe freely."
but the secrets of the mercantile world are of no interest to you, are they, traveler? you're rather special, really -- and i think you're quite aware of that.
you can have it your way. take down all the flyers and that will be the end of it. is that accommodating enough for you?
but when it comes down to it, whatever differences there may be between the various games around, they all share one important thing in common: they bring friends together.
look on the bright side -- things turned out alright, didn't they? now everyone knows that the real problem here is the stellaron, and they're willing to help us out.
i understand the situation... it seems mister ogawa was only acting out of coercion from the kairagi, he had no intent to truly harm you.
but that does not mean that the liyue of today is the same city as it was all those years ago.
hey! wait a sec -- uh... those intruders, i wanted to ask. what crime have they committed?
really? that can't be right. i remember there were lots of cloud knights in the plaza...
and that is something our consultant would say. i think it deserves a standing ovation.
calm your mind, visualize what you want to create, channel your emotions to... what again?
w--wait, it's not going to suddenly start moving, right?
i've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on belobog, himeko?
oh... that sounds like ironwork going on over there. is it a blacksmith?
well, we have made quite a bit of trouble for you recently. how about this? you can pick any one object here as you please, and you may take it with you.
that's the spirit! come on, we should take some more photos before we head back to the express.
i can feel the presence of something inexplicable next to you, but it's a shame that i can't communicate with him like you can.
but i say with certainty that you will discover your own way of the ninja someday.
the raiden gokaden were once the top five schools of the forging art in inazuma. although these families were swordsmiths by craft, they also held many important positions in the yashiro commission.
or perhaps somewhere away from the city... starsnatch cliff, or windrise?
jumping through all those hoops in the matrix was pretty exhausting, but this little gift makes me feel like it was worth it.
now, all the major lineages, except for the oak family, are dealing with the aftermath. the family has invited the crew to the radiant feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.
it's because of this empathy you have, that i still hold out a glimmer of hope. despite all that's happened, i hope we can still find common ground... through peaceful means.
i know it's useless. all fates are already revealed in the night sky, with mine, too, just another among them. i can't change anything.
so be it. well then, you who would defy eternity... time for you to enlighten me.
"that ningguang," they thought... "she must be up to something. we can't let her get away with it..."
ah, i know what this is! it's an advertisement for a home-use object finder.
however, those dishes alone aren't very healthy from a nutritional standpoint.
it's okay... it's not like i even know what she looked like...
seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
why are you fighting!?
dear himeko, mister yang, and pom-pom, we're all good here on the xianzhou luofu, so no need to worry! by the way, how's your trip going?
still, it'd be nice if those kids would stop littering... it's barely lunchtime and i've already picked up three half-eaten packs of snow-white popping candy.
think about it -- you helped me fix my machine the first time you came here, and now you're helping me the last time too... that's called having a beginning and an end, right?
i wouldn't. you'll get hit by a forest boar if you interrupt a couple's romantic conversation.
neverwinter workshop... hey! didn't gepard say there'd be a show here?
he may well have had an inkling about there being two "raiden shoguns." but he always acted as if he was completely unaware of it.
but people's feelings don't just disappear, and it's those feelings that give fireworks their purpose. if nobody wanted to watch fireworks, then they wouldn't exist.
the time has come -- let's go fill her in. i'm curious to see how she's handling those qlipoth ministers.
morning. report your affairs, in order of priority.
oh, of course! ahem. i've actually gotten really good at this! hmm...
never mind who they are, let's just film them.
it's a pleasure to join you all in celebrating the grandest ceremony of the amber era, the charmony festival. firstly, on behalf of the penacony family's five major lineages...
in short, everyone needs a reason to stay. i hope you can find yours soon.
oh? is it time for me to join you?
that's it! the thing shaped like a giant iron ball.
before i lost my position, i was applying for permission to survey the stellaron directly. it was my research topic, but i'd never even set eyes on it. my research was all based on historical data and lab simulations.
really? the stellaron hunter girl did say he was a masked fool... and it seems like a stunt they'd pull...
ooh, they're all so pretty. lemme take a better look...
ready? one, two, three...
i trust you guys. but... regarding what happened in the theme park, what do you hounds think about it? it's okay. feel free to speak your mind.
as much as i'd prefer to stay and hear some more delicious details, i suppose we had better be going now that he's been found.
a great storyteller and artist like yourself would be the yae publishing house's ace in the hole. and i would personally be hounding you over your next installment.
huh!? so these are rooftops? how long would snow have to fall to get this thick?
far from it... i know it looks the part on the outside, but i still don't know if it will really work...
exactly. how are my masters doing at the moment?
maybe you'll find something that catches your eye.
ah! what about the girl in red? that robot is gonna take her away!
well it's not just the place, silly... i mean lots of places have courtyards and pavilions! why would i like the place, of all things?
gah, time's ticking! just listen to the grown-ups!
uh... thanks, pom-pom. but did you really have to come and remind me? i'm not a newbie, you know~
but we didn't let it slip away, and the haul is now ours. that's what counts.
i, of course, need to ensure my writers' manuscripts are up to par. so, i will be taking part in the tournament myself to get a little taste of what it's like.
still doubting what your heart tells you, haniyyah?
is there anyone else following us besides you?
ah, proof that i boarded the express. the conductor gave me this.
but the truth is right here in front of my eyes, and i can't deny it.
hello my dears! it's been a long time, hasn't it?
that's a question for the scientific research division, though they may not be able to give you a definitive answer.
you're on duty, soldier. stay focused!
a "warp trotter..." that's a pretty rare aether spirit... but they were acting kind of strange in the battle -- is there something wrong with them?
not at all! you're going to lose -- i mean -- spend all of them in no time once you start playing! just try it and you'll see!
i know that the knights will do their best to help you recover your goods!
raindrops are said to be the tears of the gods, shed in response to the sorrows of the world. their constant pouring is a reminder that the gods haven't abandoned us yet.
the meteorites carry his will, and can pass it on to others. in other words, centuries on from leonard's life, and the strength of his will has not diminished one bit.
huh, i could have sworn i've seen this kind of cup before...
*sigh* finally, all done... i better meet up with fu xuan if i wanna keep going through my memories.
the underworld is still a part of belobog. if svarog's existence constitutes a threat to the people here, i will of course stand with you.
okay, we can talk here. you asked me about the plan -- in fact, i've been mulling it over for quite a long time.
anyway -- i'm preparing for the tournament final that will be held shortly. anyone feeling poetic? i need ideas.
personally, i think all these rumors are meaningless drivel. across the sea of stars, the divine foresight knows better than anyone else what happened on the luofu and the meaning behind it...
as for how we'll communicate with lynxy in the future... we'll have to have a good think about it.
hey, satoru, how have you been? keeping well?
yes... initially, i thought that the answer might lie with the riddle of the watchmaker. i was looking in the wrong place, but i did reap some rewards.
...i'm not sure at this stage, but i'll keep an eye on her.
i have great affection for the arts: music, song, poetry, shougi, and dancing. and you?
hmm, i'm still up for a few more matches! oh well, i'll go look for someone else to duel with later.
oho! this mondstadter's got talent!
huh? wh--what's going on?
a--all of them? we only have three... no, two and a half people? isn't that too much food?
(next up... i need to have a look at the map, mister yang. hmm... he must have gone through that gate up ahead. no way he would've stayed put in such a small area for two hours.)
oh, there isn't, actually. today, i'm taking my traveler friend here around to see the sights.
are you okay? can you hear me? i didn't hear a peep from your room, and it really freaked me out.
qlipoth the preservation is known for their... indifference. unless you become a zealot like those with the corporation, it's hard to share in the aeon's power.
they were completely different when i first met them.
if i were to do that, i wouldn't be any different from you.
they're moving quickly. belobog is crawling with their agents -- all they talk about is "asset evaluation."
*sigh*... you're both impossible. go on then, go lend a hand to the shrine maiden in charge of removing the flyers.
i can't say that i know her very well, but i think she just has a lot on her mind, and is trying to come to terms with her feelings.
let's go. no need to fear. we have the numerical advantage.
we can come back any time to let herta conduct her research. she's absolutely fascinated now.
clockwork ninjutsu! silvergun shura once recounted its magnificence to me. please, it will be my honor to witness it with my own eyes.
miss tingyun must have left us these clues, right?
or a ball hidden in a bush by a kitten.
phew, i made it in time! thank goodness you didn't end up like that!
this time you'll get the chance to witness welt in action, haha. i'm glad he's going with you.
ahh, so that explains the grin -- you're excited about the celebration.
hehe, let's do it. i already have an idea.
when the sun's out, bathe in sunlight. but when the moon's out, bathe in moonlight~
my goodness! well, it sounds like they made quite a big catch.
urakusai, you'd be right at home in this era.
one who seeks the way of the ninja is a ninja initiate. one who upholds the way of the ninja is a ninja. and one who lives by the way of the ninja... is a ninja hero!
on the contrary, i think it is those that i have known longest to whom i should extend the greatest courtesies.
...and perhaps the grownups among us could refrain from acting like children?
then, there's a cloud knight soldier over there. perhaps he's here for patrol, but each patrol team must consist of two members, and obviously, he's not following the rules.
hmm? i'm great.
i am sorry. it is clear to me that your sensei is not possessed by any evil spirit.
ah, you must be charlotte? welcome, welcome... please, just call me mona. gosh, this is a long way to come from fontaine. i hope it wasn't too much trouble...
so. what did you want?
that's so kind of you. i mean you've already thanked us so many times.
...ugh, this is serious, y'know.
bring it on! let's see how i beat you this time!
...how much trouble have you stirred up exactly on penacony?
hey, dunn! it's been a while. i didn't know you made security captain.
gallagher, we raise a toast to you, the slumbering hound...
ah, you're finally here! we just finished our preparations.
we still have a chance, though. to make it happen... please, black swan, guide us to those with a strong will.
thus, the current situation is that our fatui antagonist is still at large, has the two rogue commissions wrapped around their finger, and is distributing delusions from the shadows...
haha... i fear that peeking would have been a little difficult from this altitude.
after going through the express' data bank, i've truly realized just how little knowledge belobog possesses compared to you...
then, what of the one who crossed blades with his own sensei and beloved fellow disciple, and defeated them both? can one truly remain unagitated, of still mind, in moments such as these?
hehe, since you are willing to admit that, i suppose that means we can still be friends?
wait, how can there be light coming from below the ground here? is this... a water vein?
...they aren't so different from us short-life species when it comes to worries and suffering.
yoimiya, little girl, you can print your book, but on one condition. okay?
ugh, you need to log out once in a while.
ugh, this game is far too complicated.
"the book is selling exceptionally well, traveler, but we're going to need an outline for chapter four as soon as humanly possible. when is the earliest that you can turn it in by?"
master masakatsu -- how do you feel? can you hold on?
there's an old saying in liyue: "a bed that faces the door... shall be haunted by a ghost of horror."
phew... so are we all good here, or what?
another wubbaboo! ...it's crying?
if i ever get the chance... hee-hee, i wanna go again.
lemme guess, what are we up to this time? could it be... heading to the front lines? leading the cloud knight charge?
wow, so this is sumeru?
no problem! the rules are actually quite simple. to start with, i've made some minor tweaks to the snowshine lamps, making it possible for heat to be transferred between them...
nevertheless, i will make sure to treasure this incredible opportunity in my heart.
the defeat was a heavy blow to her. it also didn't help that i forgot to bring her some tricolor dango and light novels when i went to see her...
uh, not even the supreme guardian?
yes, many who have lost or fear losing their visions have rallied together under sangonomiya on watatsumi island to form a resistance group.
the key is that the plane of euthymia represents ei's inner world. defeat her there and you may well have the chance to shake the raiden shogun's will.
don't worry about it! no one's perfect. if you have any more trouble in the future, just come to me.
ooh, i would love... n--no, no need. that would be needlessly indulgent.
this was a very traumatic experience for her, and she could never come to grips with it by reasoning alone.
hmm... well, i can take your luminescent spines off your hands. but we will need a detailed contract.
(come to think of it, she disappeared after mentioning that she was going to meet with the genius society. i wonder how things turned out for her.)
here we are. this is the yae publishing house.
someone did something to bring the mirages into being. as they were just passive side products, it was natural that they couldn't provide us with any useful information.
(right. i'll be using the angler's deductive method: reconstruct what happened from the bad guy's perspective.)
...mister yang, before answering that question, i wish to continue the previous topic.
yes. i'm the successor chosen by the architects. in the future, i will become the guardian who leads belobog.
looks like things are getting heated. i think we'd better get outta here.
*sigh* well, can't say we didn't try.
do you see that mechanical gear bridge? when you cross over to the other side, you arrive at hell on earth.
this is... a dead end.
"you have inflicted your twisted lust for power upon that innocent shop owner and insulted the extraordinary art of xianzhou swordplay."
all she said was that she's sick and doesn't know when she'll get better.
yeah, yeah, you're in the footnote somewhere~
well... miss asta, we've made our decision.
these two are my friends! as for the man lying on the ground... he's a scaredy-cat who fainted from fright.
listen to me, gepard! the origin and spread of the fragmentum is linked to the stellaron. the meteorite in the architects' records, it's--
you're like a broken record...
people of belobog -- hear me!
happy birthday! let's celebrate together and make it a moment to remember for the whole year until your next birthday celebration, and so on and so forth. then, you shall have an eternity of happiness.
saving money can be difficult, so i specially prepared a savings jar. every time i received a payment, i put aside some of it.
though i had expected as much, the tales of these heroes... truly are sorrowful.
i will, i will! haha, you're as earnest as ever.
if he had just become a regular doctor, there would have been no issue. after all, the wangsheng funeral parlor wasn't unlike a regular doctor's clinic in the early days.
...so that's why you slept for so long.
there's no need to use a vision in affairs that mora can solve. as far as affairs only a vision can solve go, i know of only one...
if you like it so much, i can always make a few more!
in the reflection of the water, i see the ascension of the morning star.
why are you always asking so many questions? of course not. i just had to say something because i clearly wasn't convincing her.
oh, right, yeah. got caught up in the conversation there, hehe.
no. she was not created to ever be turned off.
wha--? there might have been a slight misunderstanding, you see, my family's business is not the usual kind of business.
i know you've always perceived there was something special about the sacred sakura. but to me, it has always been there.
oh, that's a letter i was gonna send to my mom. i haven't even finished writing it.
so, sunday is messing with us? he said we'd have a final showdown on the stage, but why is there no one here?
however, i appreciate your kindness.
thank you, traveler. she obviously has some reservations towards me. though i've only desired to help and look after her, i'm afraid it's never culminated to much.
pay no mind, for this forgetfulness happens with each new dawn. it is an occurrence that we have become accustomed to for so long.
that's right. it is i, astrologist mona megistus.
huh? so that's why nothing's going back to normal! c'mon, we need to hurry.
...and now here we are running around doing everything. even the ipc takes it easier on us.
well, i'd better carry on here, why not have a better look around? my workshop will always be open to you... and your wallets, of course.
the trust that these four fungi place in their beast-tamers, and the bond they now share, have grown stronger than the wisdom orb.
oh, that's not important. what's important is that you've remembered the joy of going through the world.
the more i think about it, the more disoriented i get, which in turn makes me think about it even more... i just want a better life for the people of belobog...
now... we should have a way of dealing with those baddies.
dazzling ninja seal, open!
when the jade chamber fell, countless valuable items from my collection plunged into the sea. i organized a salvage operation, but still there were many items unaccounted for.
we'll split into the assigned groups then. let's not waste time.
they not only helped avin find her best friend, but they also showed us what an urstone is.
wait, the old hag!? ...huh, okay, now that you mention it, the old hag does have a fondness for picking out hats...
before ei began modifying her own godly form, she took it upon herself to create a prototype puppet...
patience. as stated in the cosmic ninjutsu inscriptions: "hasty knitting produces poor fabric, as raging fires fail to cook meat through."
wait, i remember! roast the sausage, not the bread. that's the password, right?
...exhausting... it was too far up in the air, i couldn't get to it...
what if i told you it was a secret art from the grand narukami shrine, and that i had the balladeer down on his knees begging for mercy in an instant... would you believe me?
according to the manuscript, the fatui officials did not support persikov's research. they believed he had taken the wrong path.
unfortunately, they picked the wrong fight this time. once we return to the yaoqing, i'll personally lead the verdant knights into battle.
at least, that's the most reasonable explanation i can think of.
i've trained hard in the art of swordplay over these few days. it's time for me to get in the ring and prove myself. let's go.
i have awaited your arrival with great anticipation, and thoma assures me that you do indeed possess the power to change the tide of the times.
there's only four of us now, plus pom-pom. each of us can have our own carriage to sleep in! you wouldn't have the heart to leave your carriage unmanned, would you?
oops, that just slipped out. it's actually another line from an immersia...
oh yeah, i just spoke to dan heng, here's the deal: we've all gotta vote against!
i shaved some dust off the meteorite and used it to do another reading. it was actually really effective!
...just as i thought. i'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
they'd run away as soon as they saw me, or they'd be shaking with nerves and unable to speak.
well, i was never beaten up by jing yuan in reality, either...
this is the indoor training area for the kanjou commission. it's thanks to miss chisato that we were able to use this venue.
topaz hasn't given me much time to consider. she wants me to decide as soon as possible.
and in your plans, the ipc always wins. even if you lose the bet... to the family, the life of an ambassador is still invaluable.
even if i was gonna release it back into the sky, it'd have to be strong enough to fly first. if i left it where i found it... i fear it'd never get the chance to fly ever again.
the one in the distance, fighting with other monkeys over a piece of fruit, used to be the smartest person on his planet, even having the knowledge to send people soaring into the sky.
if this is what they want, i'm always up for a challenge!
so i unwrapped it and found out it was a button, with a message on the back: "just press this button, and all of penacony will explode!" sounds terrifying!
after making some inquiries, i found them to be most uncooperative. so i had to resort to this auction to finally put a stop to all this nonsense.
now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!
i sure hope they're not arguing again... quick, let's head over!
well... this doesn't necessarily mean a thing, right? in terms of methods, both the fools and the riddlers could pull it off. hasn't the ipc cracked the message, too?
...now i must ask you and the astral express for help. do you think you could persuade topaz to reevaluate the situation? the express' reputation precedes it, perhaps there's still hope...
good luck, traveler. i hope you'll do well in the competition.
but you ought not be nervous. this is not coming from the yashiro commission or the kamisato clan. it is my own individual request.
so, you're going to ask me to personally restrain my partners to ensure my own survival.
if we didn't exist, their wishes would go unfulfilled, wouldn't they?
...we can talk about that another time! right now, i wanna give you a tour of the town... here we go!
for certain reasons, her wish was difficult to fulfill. but i managed to bring her a garment.
whenever i see the grand theater, i just can't stop all these thoughts from flooding my head...
please don't! we don't need to go through that again!
we can pay extra! and if you're short on staff to help with the printing, i can pitch in!
*sigh* we've gone from being chased through every street in belobog, to waiting on every corner in the xianzhou.
our journey begins anew. life passes like a fleeting rain, eventually merging with the ground. may our next encounter be... under a clear sky.
seele, can you tell everyone in the underworld that the stellaron has been sealed? tell them the blockade will soon be over... and they'll breathe freely again soon.
n--no! uh -- i've always seen you as a... m--masterful master diviner! hehe...
to contradict my own reading would be a blasphemy against astrology.
the chance to source the "defender's will" on behalf of the knights of favonius is a huge honor for me!
you're the best, master diviner!
goodness, what's all the commotion over here? discussing something interesting behind my back?
huh... now that you... mention it...
that used to be the custom, yes, and today, it's still a popular way to dress up during festivals. but it's not a hard-and-fast rule.
um, but i think you look older than me in terms of appearance...
oh, nothing... i'm just quite envious of your relationship.
if you want to know how to make money, i will honor our agreement and give you an answer. but that is not to say that it will work for you.
so by "no longer hear from," you mean you've been unable to get in touch with this friend of yours?
wonderful. then i'll see you in three days. i look forward to it very much.
it actually doesn't matter what i do. what matters are the people i work with. when i'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. talking to you never gets old, after all.
in the dream, i yearned to tell him that we qixing, though mortal, are equally bound to the contract. each passing generation of the qixing leaves many things of value to be inherited by the next generation.
and pretty strong ones, from the looks of it. i'll hold on to them! hehe, they'll come in real handy for the next onikabuto tournament!
trust his judgment, and keep watching. we'll be right there.
exactly, if fischl and oz can also sense something, then our suspicions are likely to be right on the mora... fischl's probably agitated because she doesn't want to confront her mirage.
sorry, i... had no choice.
hearing urakusai admit defeat has put me in the most wonderful mood. in return, it's only fair that we make sure to deliver on what they're all hoping for.
we will have to end the frivolities there. there is much work to be done.
i also carried the library's new bookshelves over from springvale...
all things considered, i suppose. let's hope we can all stick together and resolve this, like we did last time.
thank you all for hearing me out. we know very well why the adepti came here today... but please forgive us, we cannot yield to your wishes.
ah! s--sorry! i didn't see you there! i was deep in concentration...
i considered this matter worthy of my attention. so i pursued them, and they led me here, where i happened to run into you.
maybe igor even attended the wardance. the xianzhou people have long lives, so it wouldn't be something that happened long ago for them.
so... where are you from? i don't think we've met in mondstadt before.
i'm not there. turn back.
you guys sure have a toxic company culture over at the ipc...
no one gets left out of my stories!
oh no... we mustn't increase jean's workload any further!
such special inks are time-consuming and laborious to produce, and the waterproof coating could also prove just as difficult.
you seriously have to try her mom's cold cut platter. it's her specialty, or something -- anyway, it's simply delightful!
i'll be out in a moment. i'm just changing.
to solve the mystery of the watchmaker, it is crucial to get the ipc's intel. the path ahead is fraught with danger... but what's trailblazing without a little danger?
wait, don't go! take it easy, i just wanted to ask you a question...
it's okay, mister alois. we're not far from mondstadt.
a... note? looks like instructions from the butler for the other servants.
there's a familiarity to the scent in the air and the firmness beneath my feet... mmm...
if we want to get our evidence, we're going to need some help. now... come with me. we must awaken the professional.
can't disqualify him just for being a widdle baby! if he's the general's retainer, there must be more to him than meets the eye.
there's a dreamlike quality to watching these starskiffs depart through the jade gate. how long will these ships sail, and which stars are they traveling to?
the first time we met diting was during the kafka hunt. i could tell there was a mysterious connection between us -- whenever he barked, i understood what he wanted to say.
hang on! why am i getting a sense of deja vu?
no way, we got the same one!
my brother can't hold them back by himself. he wasted a lot of energy on us. he's my responsibility now. besides...
only sixty-three% of planets succeed? that's not exactly comforting...
no need for the formalities, we heard what the general said... if you need something from us, just say the word.
oh, that's fine by me, i'll beat you no matter how many times you ask for a rematch... wait, but what is that place, exactly?
these voices... they are just shadows of the dreamscape. pay no heed to them.
couldn't have asked for a better judge -- zhongli said everything i was supposed to say, only far more eloquently. so without further ado... i shall pass the baton to venti.
(looks like this isn't gonna work...)
you shouldn't ignore them, by the way. very often, they're an omen of something terminal.
this atmosphere really feels strange... are you sure topaz is here?
so, dan heng, you want to stay here?
well, go on, time for you to face my hopeless fool of a friend. i'm counting on you.
let's go. half the journey is still ahead of us.
miss tingyun... it's great to see you so happy... but i can't help feeling a little sad.
from before the memory loss, before the express...
fine by me. then i'll take my time. but you'll be begging to tell me everything by the time i'm through.
if only the funeral parlor had an employee as thoughtful, proactive, and responsible as him.
don't worry, this is my treat.
four against one. well, it looks like the astral express crew has a majority vote to head for the xianzhou!
you don't have to join me if you don't want to. i can go sort out the firework materials and the boat by myself, and then you can come and meet me back at the house later.
you'd be more likely to see me pulling up outside wanmin restaurant and selling grilled tiger fish from a food cart.
my readings told me as much. but before she left, she must have imparted her mystical arts to you, surely?
you wish to play against me? i accept.
chevreuse, the rest of the special patrol is here.
it must have been kafka! she's got a scary sword.
oh, what a cute treasure coffin!
thanks to them, inazuma's culture blossomed and gained great influence at that time.
well, can we go now? or is there something else you want to talk about?
...honestly, i feel that girl is hiding something from me. i knew cocolia well, and she was never one to suddenly change her mind.
alright, check out this move!
but when her own fox trotted up and whimpered to her, she finally set me down.
speaking of delicacies -- traveler, paimon, have you eaten your fill?
once things are in full swing, not only will there be lots of official and fan-created work on display, there'll also be exclusive giveaways, prizes, and new release parties.
it'll be easier to explain once we're actually in the history-culture hall. why don't i take you there now?
anyway, it wouldn't be hard for you to get her to teach you something. you're her sister, she'd be happy to teach you.
i just wanted to take an exam, so i could get used to the atmosphere... i thought it might help me better prepare for the knights of favonius selection exam.
as i said, i need to think about inazuma's eternity. and thinking takes time.
i'm afraid you're mistaken. you're simply too good-hearted to realize that the fiendlings were manipulating its landing spot with sorcery.
that's how things were until the day we fell out. a lot of our shared possessions never left her office again...
now we have to get dodoco's story printed. c'mon, let's go to the yae publishing house.
i see... but at least you have a sense of accomplishment, right? otherwise, you wouldn't still be doing it.
i brought you guys here, and i'm standing with you till the end!
i played games with them, but i also taught them observation skills, analytical skills, how to think critically. i never taught business, though.
three times!? this can't be serious, right...?
but i don't feel that making it easier to learn is necessarily a good thing.
um... what's going on?
you want to... create a situation where all three parties are present?
i've matured now. i'm no longer so easily swayed by random people's opinions.
haha, whether you understood me or not, don't you worry. i'll take care of the kids, and make sure they stay safe.
i didn't expect to meet you here. we were just talking about tails...
if you have a target in mind, let's go investigate.
see! how do you like that, harbinger! scumbag...
belobog has a heating system of its own. however, maintaining a steady indoor temperature has always been a challenge, no matter if it's qlipoth fort or the boulder town clinic.
we belobogians haven't set foot beyond the walls for over seven hundred years, let alone venture into the sky...!
leave it to bubu pharmacy to snatch the perfect opportunity right outta my hands at the last hurdle! never mind, i'll just have to put it down in the books as a deferred consideration.
and as for hoolay, i'll send my lieutenants jiaoqiu and moze to check on his condition in prison and ready him for transport. if there are no more questions, shall we get this started?
that's... probably not possible. time is running out, and she's a master of disguise. and even if we catch her, she won't come quietly...
by the way, i've just noticed... you're a nameless, right? is this your first time here on penacony?
see, new guy gets it! what did i say -- a man of culture!
my brother and xavier were speaking to the restaurant owner about using the place as a filming location, they should be here soon.
it's not a big deal, dunn. y'know, if you get a chance, would you wanna get on stage with us again?
how interesting. for a split second, it felt like countless versions of you, alike yet distinct, gave entirely different responses.
traveler, paimon, nice to see you again. welcome back to inazuma.
sounds like we did it. let's press on.
if i can pass on everything i have learned, i can create a legacy that will live on long after i am gone.
i'm constantly revising and expanding it. so far, there are over thirty editions.
as you wish! then, leave it all to me!
ninjas only strike when the opportunity presents itself. waiting might be the right course of action to take for now.
i'm content with being able to hear such a moving tune and feel the emotions and story behind it.
mmm, it's sour and sweet and has the scent of nature.
is this... the skysplitter? or somewhere else?
a fire that builds up, clashes, and burns, and an unwavering determination. they have roused the slumbering will, snapping its fetters to welcome new life...
traveler, not long after we met, i remember you mentioning that liyue, mondstadt... and every nation has their own unique fashion.
greetings, friends. it's been a while.
we can't just leave mother here like this. at least... at least let me leave this rose with her...
so keep your cool. follow me, the farewell ceremony site is just up ahead.
it's almost time. she should be arriving any moment now.
what's wrong? i've never seen someone look so confused before. well, don't worry, because director hu's here to explain it all!
yep, we're from the astral express~
if i win, then you need to say everything that's in your heart. no more running from your feelings!
nevertheless, in addition to us, there is also the resistance on watatsumi island.
i remember lots of folks like to relax around the plaza. let's head there first.
we're finally here. let's all head to our rooms first and put down our bags.
i trust penacony won't let you all down.
i'm not sure whether you have realized it or not, but i took you through a very long, scenic route and visited all kinds of places just now because...
...ooh! this golden crab is too delicious! i have never eaten anything this good in my life!
my brain must be filling in the blanks... probably because i never drank any famous tea in belobog.
this must be how penacony was constructed. with the aid of outsiders, the prisoners were finally liberated and established the land of the exiles.
that's why there was a flaw in your dream. in other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
in other words, fireworks symbolize the past.
...a fitting metaphor for the nameless' trailblazing spirit.
as long as i can fulfill that deep-seated desire... i don't care how long i live.
yeah, it's his problem, not yours.
you have to try this fish. it's found exclusively in the waters around seirai island. they shipped it to inazuma overnight, and it was still alive right up until i ordered it.
i've gotta say, aetherium wars is really fun, i've been grinding for several days straight -- barely even had time to eat!
uh, excuse me! anyone here? strange... seems like no one's around. guess we'll just have to keep going.
i know, but the thing that i can't get out of my mind... is the present.
going for the big reveal right at the beginning would have been an anti-climax of the most literal kind. i wanted to see how you'd react in a situation like this, and you did not disappoint...
do make the most of your trip here, won't you? quite a lot has changed.
we predict their next move, and we take them down.
our next stop is a small planet called jarilo-vi.
he was, but not anymore.
under the beds, the windowsills... nothing can be left out. the smallest corners are the most likely to gather dust.
i will also gather some people to try and root out the rest of the fatui in inazuma.
so my grandpa inherited the funeral parlor, while my great-uncle stayed in chenyu vale to practice medicine... they never spoke to each other again.
it's about time to start. find yourself somewhere to sit and we'll kick things off.
bronya said she's willing to wait seven hundred years for us...
listen, touch, and ponder, and therein lies the sensation. cherish it, because that's what makes us exist. such is the only answer humans can offer when facing the nihility.
the harmony needs a new direction. only by bidding farewell to the past can we actually sail into the future.
i appreciate your kind words, general huaiyan. but won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of yanqing and yunli's time? they should be preparing for the ceremony.
but with you by my side, we will emerge victorious. let's go!
well, it's a special case. only geniuses get titles like this.
this is the supply zone where the maintenance crew works. there's a path here that leads to the nearest railway platform. let's head over there and meet up with welt.
you see? serval's modifications to the lamps allow you to illuminate lamps that are out of your reach.
ahaha... that's very considerate of you. however, you don't have to go above and beyond for me.
but this girl once had an aranara as her best friend, and they haven't met in a very long time.
one-eighty. sold.
let's explore around. be careful, everyone.
or get him to hand over his memory bank. we could go through it ourselves.
and not only that, the entire theater is eerily quiet. no audience, no staff, no one around...
that's most likely top-secret. the manuscript didn't reveal any details, but persikov did mention that the machine was modeled after the power of a god.
that guy's been staring at us this whole time... hide-and-seek might have to wait -- let's see what he wants.
if you wake up to the same monotonous meal each day, you will start to feel fatigued even before you start working.
you must have met guuji yae before? well, she's a fox envoy!
hehe, i suppose i should start by telling you the origins of the irodori festival.
everyone has their own imagination. after some chance coincidence, she met an "aranara."
i'm just joking, of course. there's already a whole industry established for that. they don't need me muscling my way in to their business.
don't be upset, you win some, you lose some! how about i teach you a few new tricks?
and for that, i'll have to ask the two nameless to visit the shackling prison.
come on then, give me the lowdown. i may be willing to offer my skills -- it all depends on the situation.
uh... got it. thanks...
mmm... nothing major. how are you feeling these days? any aches or pains?
let me quickly inspect the ingredients in the kitchen...
the engine of creation was commissioned for combat shortly after its completion and played a significant role in the battles against the legion.
forget about training and work, just breathe and feel the wind... nothing else...
hah, then it's mere flattery... you pick your moments to wisecrack, don't you? now i don't know whether to take what you said earlier seriously...
oh, i am not a knight of favonius yet...
heh, no need to worry. i apologize for any inconvenience caused to your delightful dream journey. what you just mentioned about the chips really piqued my interest. would you mind providing more details about the incident?
so... what's the special connection between you and the player, then?
he wandered off, but he left behind the puzzle piece.
perhaps, there's something else we can do?
i've thought it over. there's only one thing i can do -- go ask her directly.
you sure about that? even our trailblazing space anchors sound better.
but could you... spend a little longer with me?
any potential clients around? ooo...
*chuckles* we need to give him some time, march. i think he treasures the time spent with you guys.
so, i have to pick someone and clear them of "interference"?
so it's the power of the aeon? i see...
i understand now that people won't always follow a beacon's guiding light. even though the way forward may be dark and dangerous, they will still resolutely forge ahead.
...why do you look so unimpressed?
as a traveler, there must be a great many things you know about that are complete unknowns to the people of inazuma. what is commonplace to you may be fresh and original to them.
and in fact, what meng has said is entirely plausible. spirits, on occasion, do find a way into our world.
never mind that. so, did you find the box?
(b--because, uhh... well, we're too law-abiding to understand bad guy logic.)
...you will see me appear once again as i have done today -- only next time, my blade will show no mercy.
alright alright, don't panic. leave it to me, you've come to the right person.
what are you up to? i only just convinced her everything's fine, you know...
just to be clear... you're sure i don't have to pay... for any of this?
now, if i only had a bottle of sake, that would make it perfect.
i can be a little bit camera-shy -- just don't laugh at me. here, you hold the camera.
tsk, you shouldn't make jokes like that in public, people may hear you and get the wrong idea.
well are those who rise in the early morn, while those late to bed i shall forewarn~
as promised, let me tell you the story behind this little heater.
a punchline with a straight face -- i suppose that's your specialty.
she's just a little... lost. it is only my wish to help her.
that's enough chatter. get to work!
it seems like there are some issues with the filming equipment today. we're stuck for the moment...
nope, she seemed normal to me. she was kinda harsh at first, but she turned out to be a nice, reasonable lady.
wh--what i meant was... i am not an official knight of favonius. i'm just a knight-in-training currently serving as a maid...
lamentable... my ninja speed isn't fast enough to outrun cause and effect.
so... mondstadt grilled fish... is the correct answer?
for example, by providing vision bearers with safe refuge, or manufacturing counterfeit visions for them as a contingency measure.
...that actually makes sense.
i know i still have a long way to go compared to the honorary knight -- listening to your stories is like reading about myths and legends...
time is running out. we need to hurry.
make sure you're all paying attention...
it looks like this is the right way. let's keep going!
as for how much my insight is worth in terms of mora, everyone has their own idea. there is no standardized way to measure something like this.
we must be close... i wonder who she is?
*sigh* okay... i feel bad that we didn't find a spare component.
it's much livelier here than the plane of pure silence and tranquility that i'm used to.
i see. so compared to a distant and uncertain future, what you really care about is making sure the people around you have a good life...
because you three made a great team back in the space station. my guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
the visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the stellaron. she knew that alisa rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it...
haha, he's my little brother, of course i don't want to leave him alone. but... i don't have any other choice.
elio only gave me one instruction: allow the astral express to pursue the grand legacy. it means that the watchmaker's legacy holds great significance to trailblazing, and to you.
alright, alright, stop joking around. the lightning-lord may be all-powerful, but they're not going to cause sudden memory loss. i'm just glad you're fine.
unfortunately, of the five, only the amenoma art still maintains its artisan lineage. the descendants of the isshin art are also still alive, but the craft has been lost to time.
hehe... i wish you both a fun-filled time on narukami island.
maybe. but i have to prove to her that my present will is no product of erosion. the future i shall forge will be a grand undertaking, one that will be resistant to erosion.
well, what else would you expect of a genius astrologist's mirage?
you could take the view that whatever i say to them is meaningless, because they are but disembodied memories held in the ley lines.
"tragic fate"... that duke turned his dying body to flames and sacrificed his life as a martyr. he was a determined and heroic pathstrider. not even a villain should be disparaged like this.
the express spends seven standard days at each stop. its passengers are allowed to do as they deem fit during that time.
do you know miss jade from the ipc's strategic investment department? bonajade exchange belongs to her.
at some point, she started going down a path that became increasingly difficult for me to join her on.
satomi is yae publishing house's ace in the hole. her specialty is that she can write all kinds of completely different stories, and all under different pen names. as for what those names are, well, that's a trade secret.
i called for the gag order and for the exuvia to be hidden to temporarily stabilize the situation, and also to prevent something similar to the incident in mondstadt.
at the moment, there are so many things that seem impossible... but are they really never going to happen? maybe it's just that the moment to disprove these "impossibilities" hasn't arrived yet.
well... doctor jiaoqiu? are we really doing this? shouldn't we defeat him in a more honorable way...? maybe we should just completely forget about this idea.
funny, the word "snatcher" didn't come to mind when i saw him... he struck me as more of a... potential client.
haha, i won't even be able to compete with you in a few years.
but what will i do about my astrology research? ...no, wait, i don't even have a place to stay.
but master yanqing, facing you in a duel... do i really stand a chance?
the silvermane girl? she's pretty. i like looking at her.
i am not who you think i am, nor will my home be as fortunate as your world.
*sigh* we need to follow these sparkly traces to find miss tingyun, right?
we've arrived! from here we need to take a starskiff to the cloudford victory zone.
all the miners here huddled together... anyone else getting deja vu?
but don't think we'll just hand over the mastery mark without a fight -- you'd better make sure you're ready before you even think about challenging us!
thanks for your invitation, but i am the silvermane guards' intelligence officer -- i can't just drop my work and go travelling...
indeed. in kafka's words... that's also a "missing part" of my life.
that's right. you remembered something about the aranara, haven't you?
so, listen to everything i say. let's go!
looks like yinshu isn't here after all... where could she be?
despite her... quirks, she's still an experienced adventurer. i think we should trust her.
oh, and don't forget to return the pass permit to me after you have finished with it.
but that's quite enough politics for today. let's get back to our fun little survival game.
cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge -- that the truth will spread far and wide: to save the world, we must risk it all.
emergency food...? though i have never tried any, it doesn't sound like a specific dish... let's think of something else.
relax, she's the strongest girl i've ever seen.
but it became something like a mission once everyone had handed their wishes over to me.
are such haphazard instructions really okay...
i can't say for sure, but they're definitely planning something for the charmony festival.
wherever the fiery giant treads, scorched earth follows. yet, it's those consumed by unending fire... who, after the flames vanish, quietly hold the ashes in their lonesome embrace.
am i? i feel pretty normal. anyway, this case has really got my detective blood pumping. i need to get to the bottom of it...
why did these two items appear together? did the raven bring the book here?
i don't plan to do anything like that. i think... i think i will set myself a new goal: to live each day without regrets.
if only amber or miss lisa were here...
but that general huaiyan, he looks... so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. is that old man really an arbiter-general?
...uh, i'm not sure it's as poetic as that...
doctor primitive...?
isn't that topaz's support squad?
hey, what's that supposed to mean?!
huh? something feels different about this place?
so, following the clues in the script, i came up with some theories about the meme. that's why i instructed silver wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel...
are you suggesting that the ipc has a remedy?
you're thinking that there's not a huge difference between me turning these children into my informants and the actions of those two businessmen. am i right?
well, it's almost time. let's send her home.
ah, i suppose it's settled then. i'll wait for you at the kamisato estate tomorrow morning.
hey, i understand. okay, let's calm down. tell us what happened so we can help you.
is that so? i am delighted to hear it.
g--gepard, it's you! i didn't think you'd have the time to visit with things so tense on the front line, hehe...
i never... looked at it that way before...
i'm so sorry! this is the last one, i promise!
everyone, i've managed to find the old diagram.
hehe, don't you worry about that, urakusai. arrangements are being made.
i'm not sure. everything happened so quickly. but regardless, the family must be hiding something -- something about the truth of the dreamscape...
i, um... decided to take a break today...
what, you'd rather leave it to our fox lady here? she'll probably break a nail, and then we'll never hear the end of it...
now, we may not know which mountain this was -- but we can safely assume that it's not dragonspine. otherwise, someone would have recognized it, right?
there were some very valuable images on that film, and we hadn't gotten around to making a backup... i must admit, the thieves chose a good target, and they were fast and efficient.
i wasn't scared by anything... but on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
last year? just yesterday at dreamflux reef, you were...
can i bring you to one more place? it isn't another tourist attraction -- it's my very own secret base.
ah! i've figured it out! i heard a loudmouthed guard say that a group of outsiders had met with cocolia... you must be them?
anything related to you becomes like a fog that even i cannot penetrate.
hah, try keeping me amused this time.
let them meet svarog, and let's see if his calculation result is any different. for you, for him... there's no harm in trying, right?
are there... no staff members here at all?
adepti sigils serve as a means of integrating the mechanical devices with adepti art. they are as indispensable as the mechanical core itself.
from this day forth, this body will remain your assistant.
whew... you scared the life out of me! we're here for the celebrations -- we're not looking for more conflicts...
isn't it just like cooking food over an open flame? if the house is a pot, then the heater is the stove it rests on.
that massive tree has suddenly sprung to life!
while you were away, welt and i did some research and came to some interesting conclusions. let me know if you want to ask about anything.
this is mister jiaoqiu, the healer working for the general of the xianzhou yaoqing.
haha, it's the real me, march -- real as they come.
this warp trotter -- i mean -- aether spirit... they've been acting a little strange. do you have any idea what the reason could be?
yes... we knew it was not a long-term solution and that it was only a matter of time before it would be exposed... but we cannot simply abandon master masakatsu.
i originally thought her a bit too... hard-headed. with someone of her character on the qixing, i've had some extra messes to clean up behind the scenes.
true. dan heng's always saying that clara's really insightful for her age.
but that's what everyone said before we went to penacony! "you'll be totally safe under the family's protection!"
honesty... modesty... these are the virtues cherished by the knights...
but i can't abandon my brother and the other guards -- i'm a landau! it's up to you now, i believe in you. you've given me new hope!
it's alright! i understand your concern, but it's okay. i'm also a capable nameless, just like yourself.
you wanna hear a story? alright, alright. sit here, and i shall tell you the story i'm most proud of -- the story of the naganohara family! you'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?
i'll be fine. it brought a few things back, of course. but i've made my decision to move forward.
i suggest that you act just before sunrise, while most people are tired and resting. you may find some important leads.
he's one of the fatui harbingers, right? sakujirou mentioned him to me before... and i heard about everything that happened in liyue, too.
i ought to sit down and conceptualize how to incorporate and play up the way of the dazzling ninja in my narration...
makoto saw a bigger picture than i did. in her view, a "dream" is more imaginary, more abstract than an "ambition."
don't come close. this bomb is very dangerous! and... i'm the real firefly!
*sigh* if i'm not careful i'll start boring you all with sob stories from the past. let's get back to you guys. if long-lost bronya told you to come here, you must have something important to tell me?
this is one aspect of the truth that i can share only with you.
but our enemy has long lain hidden within the harbor. if we do not act against them now, they will surely gain the upper hand.
come on, camping is about teamwork! let me have a try.
this must be the place. let's do this.
but, thanks to my brother, everything is getting better now.
she was built to resist erosion. her will is stronger than any other living being's, including you and me.
where are you... where are you...
because i had just severed ties with a lifelong companion.
but it is in this miniscule distance that paths cross, and countless worlds connect. the universe may not remember every person who leaves a tie along the silver rail, but we will.
yeah, that makes sense... general jing yuan knows how to handle things.
my pops actually received a gift from one of his old customers over there. it was from the winery or something...
the strategic investment department comprises the ipc's most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.
that won't be necessary, mister yang. as the angler once said: "a true detective operates as effectively from their armchair as from the scene of the crime."
naturally, since you are the face of that historic event. i intend to make chess pieces for everyone who was involved that day, including myself.
this is the dream jigsaw, right? so, we're supposed to find the exit? but where can we find the last piece...?
thunder's roar, lightning's flash, the wind's assault, and the rain's descent... all these things take place with no regard for the feelings of the common people.
negotiating with robots... i can't say i've tried it before.
it wouldn't be surprising. i've seen the ipc's file on blade. if the details are accurate, he's incredibly dangerous.
well... how else was i supposed to save your skin from the balladeer, exactly?
but with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, i need time to give it some thought.
...what was i thinking!? no... i shouldn't... that was a diabolical thought!
i'm sorry you didn't get to experience the festival atmosphere this time around... i promise i'll make it up to you all next time.
*sigh* what does it matter... i know just as well as anybody else that i've got no friends...
they pertain to three whose visions were taken from them... perhaps once you've met them, you will understand...
i... i don't know much about warfare, but i don't see why a commander needs to lead the charge. the situation here is totally different from the restricted zone.
concerns? if i told you of the concerns of the liyue qixing, do you think your shoulders could bear the burden? and, if you ever made the mistake of mentioning them to others...
meng, i'm back! i'm afraid we're still no closer to finding big g.
i suppose that means this coin doesn't belong to miss topaz after all. i wonder whose it could be... it doesn't seem to have any info on it...
it's the oldest and most famous animation from penacony. it follows the adventurous life of clockie and his friends in the town of dreamville. to date, over ten thousand episodes have aired!
who cares? they're here and alive. do they look like a mannequin to you?
...and should our feathers be damaged, then we share our wings with one another.
ready? my stomach's always ready for food and drink!
that chess piece i told you about -- we can start work now. i have the traveler's measurements here.
himeko must be eager to hear about what we've been up to on this mission too, right?
yeah, you've never seen it? the express comes here every once in a while.
it was part of an agreement she made with a friend fifty years ago. but she isn't as spry as she used to be, so now it's up to me.
nice to see you, clara. what brings you to the robot settlement?
...is that so? i haven't been able to shake off this familiar feeling since just now... maybe this is what they call deja vu, hehe. or it could purely be serendipity.
and then he just left. i took a photo of him -- he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
that's not what i meant. though i do admire the nameless...
sounds to me like you encountered a ghastly little ghostie in the wild?
mika, please go ahead. as a full knight of favonius, you represent all of us from mondstadt here.
i think i'm starting to get the hang of this...
you want to spar with me? of course, but no complaining if you lose!
fischl has been very excited about this trip from the start... but i have a feeling she doesn't want to see her own mirage...
the knight that i want to be someday... ohh... that feels so far away that it's a little difficult to imagine...
everything i do is to comprehend the truths of the world... even a vacation is a way to meet this end.
perhaps mister yang has heard -- there is a large boat called the "eventide" anchored along the sea of dreams, where soft music and dancing persist endlessly every night.
the express has its fair share of experiences with stellarons. the thing you're worried about, and the answers we're looking for are one and the same. besides...
yes, it does. i always thought that she must have grasped some elusive, arcane wisdom to arrive at the conclusions she did.
now, look here. this device is used to drive away evil spirits. it'll absorb the curse inside you and cause it to take a physical form.
that's good. i was worried you'd be a little uncomfortable.
are there any other ways for adventurers to make mora besides their remuneration from the guild?
i really can't recommend that store highly enough. a couple more visits, and you'll find that the fur on your tail is silky-smooth.
are you all right? can you hear me? do you remember your name?
it's such a mess... i must clear everything away quickly so that we can serve more customers!
haha, i can't deny that my hobbies had no part to play in this. however, regardless of whether it's light novels or a festival, catching people's attention with a fresh concept is the essence here.
the arbor's rebirth has frightened the elders who lurk behind the scenes... they fear the resurgence of abominations, much like what happened thirty years ago.
let's go, miss chevreuse. i look forward to working with you.
i suppose it wasn't too much to spend all this mora on...
just you wait and see! i'll show off my skills in the ring and win a match. i'll make both of you proud!
hmph, i'm not just a pretty face, y'know! i've got poetry on standby twenty-four/seven.
of course, all cooperation is based on one premise...
i understand, but... i must protect those that believe in the architects...
very good! the wish needs to be heartfelt, though, so let me help add a little realism to the equation:
you mean the "academic fraud" mister reca mentioned? i can't believe that sort of thing happens in paperfold university, too.
the traces... where did they go? is diting malfunctioning?
belobog kids are making snowmen while children here are writing prescriptions...
either way, he's an "enigmatic" character for sure.
right. especially with someone outside of the shogunate like myself, who is in a good position to test out where each party draws the lines.
*sigh* i know these kinds of stories are all the rage nowadays, but... i really can't bring myself to like them.
well, we'd better go find him then. back to belobog it is...
but... are we just going to let them get away with this...?
at first, it was but the size of one room. now, it is large enough to blot out the moon in the skies above liyue.
when i clasped musou isshin in my hands, i had the feeling that she was by my side once again.
yeah, based on misha's recollections, the scenes in the dream bubble appear to be his childhood memories.
i was so close to bursting into tears! that would've been embarrassing...
there is still much to do... the people will have felt the effects of the engine of creation. there are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal...
haha, i wanna see the stellaron too, y'know -- it was my research topic for over a decade. you don't get that many decades in life.
oh, on the subject -- are you busy these days? if not, then you should totally come along. i'll prepare an extra-pretty firework, just for you!
everyone, please do not panic. i believe that the family will give everyone a satisfactory answer in due time.
jiaoqiu always said i'm the most impatient person among the cloud knights, and i can't argue with that. so there's no reason for you to be more anxious than me.
madam yukong! after thirty years, we find ourselves fighting side-by-side once more!
then, are you willing to retract your previous decision? as for the debt... we'll find a way to gradually repay it, but it'll take some time...
he's probably already started collating the ecological data and survey results for jarilo-vi. it's always good to know more about the destination before you start a journey.
right? i knew you were a gamer! wanna check it out on the way?
you're right, but the things we've seen today have brought back many memories for me.
until we're back in the overworld, i propose a temporary truce and cooperation. your true intentions are of interest to me...
let's look around. if we see anywhere good, let's take a picture and let bea have the final say.
why...? because i also want the wardance to go smoothly.
we could always just go pester masterful chef, xiangling.
i'm afraid it's your own fault for adding all those strange ingredients thoma. the soup flavor wasn't quite the same afterwards...
i'll support you with all i've got, so go ahead and write the rest of your story!
you're familiar with many of the locals in the administrative district, right? if possible, i'd like you to head to the city center and see if they have any clues to offer us.
dan heng's situation is special -- we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
i'm heading out. i hope the next time we meet, we'll both have several more victories to our names.
the vision hunt decree was obviously devised as a means of manipulating the shogun, the ones behind it knowing full well her susceptibility as a puppet with a single-minded focus on eternity.
keep moving. just walk forward at normal pace and don't do anything to give away that we suspect anything.
there are things... i'm hiding from you...
...i see, so you need to know how to make yourself interesting, to draw people's attention...
as an observer, i get to see the similarities all the time, which naturally leaves me desiring to see something more unique.
i am the only one in all of inazuma who can visit her while she is resting.
many challenges still lie ahead for inazuma, but i am prepared for them.
yes, that's right. in any case, my weapon of choice is the greatsword... and i don't see any of those here.
i... i'm going to the knights of favonius library! there must be some guidance there on the subject of love!
oh -- i've been wondering -- you see that heater over there? why do they keep it outdoors? this city is so weird...
i trust her judgment too, but...
the almighty shogun... i have seen her on but only a few occasions, most of them formal ceremonies...
it is in almost every respect a far superior dish to the so-called "satisfying salad," the sole exception being the steep price...
you... weren't seriously thinking of joining me for the whole night, were you...?
but of course. that's why i'm here waiting for you.
makoto and you are inazuma's past and future, and both are indispensable.
the construction of the jade chamber requires a great deal of space. the abandoned mine outside the golden house has been selected as the building site. once you have collected the materials, please take them there.
there are so many people!
...still, i can't believe how arrogant she is. i was pretty mad with her for a while.
...aaaand i'm doing it again, aren't i? ugh. what i meant to say was, while kouichi is bringing the boat here, we should try to find some firework materials.
the resurgence of the sanctus medicus and the gathering of the borisin... are merely distractions orchestrated by an unseen force, meant to divide the alliance's attention.
let me see... hmm, i see, so if you first... ...and then you...
this place could do with a good spring clean... allow me!
norbert probably didn't believe any of that nonsense -- i think he just wanted to prove himself and add more to his fortune.
there's no need to be nervous, of course. now, let's have some breakfast before we leave.
remain vigilant at all times. any suspicious movements must be suppressed as quickly as possible before the situation gets out of hand.
people die, and i am no exception. death is like a script, a fate that cannot be defied. but that's exactly why...
hehe, perhaps... or you could take the view that she's acting like a little child, throwing a temper tantrum and locking herself in her room. don't you think?
this would be unthinkable on the surface. robots are merely tools in the overworld.
but now that i look closer, it seems like the lanterns are floating in midair. how is that possible?
and you are mondstadt's great hero, my equal in status. so...
yes. and just like your piece, the jade chamber piece will be scaled for the game.
well, i--it's just... the dust has settled now. the stellaron problem has been resolved, and cocolia...
to claim that i "made" her do anything would be imprecise. we reached a mutually beneficial agreement, as is always the case in our dealings.
traveling to other worlds is all that anyone seems be writing about these days. huh, goodness knows what they find so disappointing about their own world.
it really is nothing major, i stand by that. oh, but since you're so curious, let's have him relate the story one more time, just for you.
ah, that's the alley that gepard mentioned -- the one contaminated by the fragmentum, right?
alright then. i'll come out for a while.
...you and i have both witnessed the great loss that progress can bring.
huh? is this a broadcast?
and if a couple of ghosts do come, you could invite them to play a game! hmm... actually, why don't we put a table and some chairs in here? hee-hee...
he seemed genuinely shaken, though. i don't think he was lying. i was always taught to talk about the "false sky" during astrological readings... could there be more to such phrases than i have been led to believe?
what happened? the supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and gepard had to rush back to the front line... i don't understand...
the knights of favonius is the strongest shield that mondstadt has. how can i defend the people if i'm only ever dealing with minor matters!
no, i never issued such an order.
she had a valid point, and i could sense her genuine happiness. it's just that...
also, i wanted to ask you guys something. did you see a bunch of scary-looking men come by here, at all?
you were quite expedient, kyle. did you find anything out from the department of transportation?
my time here in liyue is precious. i should make good use of it to study...
until the bids exceed the value of the item you're after, you can keep raising the price. if the bids go beyond what you can accept, then you let someone else take it.
sorry, but could you give me a few more minutes?
if there is a way to bridge the gap between the two worlds, we can definitely go back to the time when you and i were not divided. when we could stand side by side against the eternal freeze and the fragmentum.
but before that moment arrives, we can still choose what we do... we all have this right, don't we?
i guess. to be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. you don't have to show up, but himeko might be upset if you don't.
attempting to storm qlipoth fort by ourselves? forget it, seele. i don't care how skilled you are. i'm not sending you on a suicide mission.
oh my, i'm human and so are you. can you get a grip...
come onnnn, you were the most excited last time we got off the train!
our current theory is that stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain aeon throughout the universe. we can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
based on what you've told me, it seems that all victims of the meteorites fell into a deep sleep, and all of them dreamed of a snowy mountain.
this sum was paid by northland bank, so they are still wary of me to this day.
...xipe the harmony. legend has it that they participated in the crusade against the imperator insectorum and devoured ena the order for unknown reasons.
...i thought the honorary knight would only ever be busy with powerful enemies like stormterror...
perhaps. either way, i'm glad they didn't recognize me. the fewer people who know what happened today, the better.
hehe, xingqiu, you have to be honest.
now, from my predictions, i know that my master's friend has left mondstadt, leaving her successor as the current guardian of that box.
rest early and don't worry about nightmares, monsters under your bed, or anything like that.
ha, just kidding -- here you goooo~
forgive me for speaking out of turn, baseball bat ninja. but for your safety, you and your companions should leave this land of dreams as soon as possible.
if that's so... her arch-nemesis, tasraque, the wicked dragon, is made up of everything that opposes her and rejects her fantasies.
in the end, i... i couldn't do it...
aww, what are you talking about? the fun's just about to begin.
ugh! how unreasonable!
ahh! okay, it's about time i headed back. the naganohara fireworks show is just around the corner, and there's still a lot of things to get ready.
hmm, let me do some market research! wait here, my faithful assistants, i'll be back with you in a moment. it shouldn't take too long.
*sigh* i hardly think giving flowers to your crush is worth throwing one's life away for...
when you're ready, come and find me. once we've finished with this, we'll get back to the big g matter.
certainly, great ninjas think alike. this "class" dojo seems shady. it harbors fiendlings. exercise caution, fellow ninja warriors.
imagine if all the traveler ever thought about was making you stronger, forcing you to build rock-hard muscles just to watch you send mitachurls flying... would you gladly comply?
i don't know if they would open the vault door, but before i left, i witnessed a well-dressed pepeshi person plummet from the sky while those around him continued on their way, unfazed.
this mirage is quite fascinating. it presents life like a stage play, with each scene more captivating than the last.
whatever the case, we must continue living, one step at a time... most people are doing their best to survive -- they have no time to ponder ancient beings hidden in the universe.
everyone has their preferences, so it's important to choose the right gift if you want to get through to them.
why do i write reports rather than using my divination to earn mora? i would never use hydromancy for the sake of mora, nor did i learn hydromancy for that purpose.
wangsheng funeral parlor welcomes advance reservations! when you choose us, you'll never have to worry about what might be around the corner.
yes, i think we should just make the best of this mistake. in the final exhibition match, i'll simply wear whichever outfit accumulated the most votes.
oh, i think i know what you were going to ask. you've come to the right person.
no, i have nothing to share with you at this time. but you... you use elemental energy without the aid of a vision. how is this possible? please enlighten me.
she is your sister, after all.
your place has mountains and bodies of water, food and fun, and i get to hang out with you... how wonderful!
*sighs* there i was thinking this guy would gradually open up...
oh, you'd really like to? then it's my honor... or i suppose i should say, please pardon my inexperience.
what's with the funny look? am i not strange enough for you? name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. i already made up a few dozen for myself.
that's no ordinary kid. so young and yet so... stubborn? no, intelligent?
kouichi just bursts out laughing and says actually, this is one of his carpenter friends. turns out he's a lot younger than he looks -- just a few years older than me.
...oh, come on, baizhu. i'm not that unreasonable.
ooh, is someone having a case of nerves? we're just going to school. how bad can it be?
"dealt with before"? so... "death" does happen in penacony, if i understand correctly?
alright, i'll help you out -- the first and last time the landau siblings will work together!
when i arrived, i happened to see a child holding it. he said the flowers were prepared by aunt jessie, for the watchmaker, and the war comrade he'd missed his whole life.
always thrilled to hear you're in good health. but i was really asking about your emotions. have you managed to calm down?
the delusions... they're still on your mind, aren't they?
huh? you're not coming with us?
intruders, give it up! you will be guaranteed a fair trial.
she's been lost and unsure of herself ever since her beloved sensei's abrupt departure.
from the moment my mother married my father, she became the mother of the kamisato household, and with that came all sorts of duties. at the same time, the prestige of the yashiro commission brought its own share of responsibility.
the next contest is starting soon -- let's go to the prep zone.
i love the atmosphere here, as i'm sure you'd expect.
this new age started after that great battle, you know.
but after she said those words: "the time of the adepti has long passed. if even the liyue qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for liyue..."
i may know the reason why. the engine of creation was constructed solely by the people of belobog, without any external assistance.
hmm, with our fontaine friend present, perhaps we should rename this event to the "three nations congenial poetry gala"...
who knows? i mean, we are the champions!
clara? oh, the girl we saw in the great mine?
i'll respect you too if you keep your word.
that statue... it wasn't here last time.
if i remember correctly, isn't quinn one of the four drunkards of mondstadt...?
i know. march, get out of there right now.
i don't often feel tired. seeing the mora come in has a way of making me feel quite invigorated.
it's so quiet... someone say something.
thank you. our traveling together was fate -- and of the good kind, i'd say.
maybe i should bring some novels or comic books? at least then i won't be too bored while staying in the hotel room. but these books are so heavy...
so... the train has been swallowed by a giant bug? and we're inside its stomach?
ugh, why do they get angry? what's wrong with a few earnest health tips?
ah, speak of the devil! i was just wondering when you might show up, hehe.
that guy just casually throws this kind of question at us? what exactly is his deal? but fine, i'll answer i guess...
one need not scry to know today's weather will be good.
hey... did you just scare off a fragmentum monster?
it is as the stars foretold.
let's do it! time to end the mystery once and for all!
take an ordinary train as an example: it's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
how scary, could he have taken our memories as well? i don't want to lose any more memories.
oh my, i didn't know you had dreams of stardom, dan heng.
i never had the chance to see her one last time. but i would like to believe that she kept her promise to me until the very last.
you coached a child to lie, made her betray her own innocence and confuse her conscience. do you not realize how contemptible that is?
the shogun's army haven't given up on their search for you yet, but with the help of this shuumatsuban ninja, i'm sure you'll be able to rendezvous with your friends.
i told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself... i was just thinking out loud really, i had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
how about this: you tell me where those two people are, and i'll take the comb back to them for you. sound good?
i mean, i sure can't imagine inazuma without the shogun.
the family is planning on covering up all news about miss robin's death. if news gets out, penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...
oh... maybe i should train some more...
great. well, let's leave the formalities aside from now on, and make this just a friendly chat.
i, maid noelle, on behalf of mondstadt and the knights of favonius, officially welcome you!
she doesn't seem surprised in the slightest. does that just come with being an experienced adventurer, or...?
no, don't worry. it's all just a big misunderstanding.
hee-hee, just a joke, sorry. everything you see is everything that's present. for the moment, at least.
why? it's not like i'm here to cause trouble. let's just relax.
uh? he didn't send you all here?
they may see this as an opportunity to try and make it up the mountain. i need you to fend them off so that that doesn't happen.
i heard that you'll be going on a search with ganyu to find the descendants of a fairy lady from a fontaine legend.
hehe, that's only because i know your parents so well. they're both really nice people, so i didn't think the apple would fall too far from the tree.
it's clear to me that i'm not the only one holding this belief -- i'm sure my ancestor had similar views.
but have you really been enlightened with new ideas? or have you been degraded by irreversible erosion?
in other words... we just need to make quinn realize that this time is different.
a playground... ahh, how wonderful.
it seems illegal stowaways are really quite common on penacony... but that guy in the story, i don't think he deserves any sympathy at all.
there's really no need. in any case, you're in a much more perilous position than i am. if anything, you need my protection.
...and i didn't even get around to arranging his accommodations, or introducing the wine merchants to him...
thank you for your comforting words. but this is my basic duty as inazuma's archon, and i have neglected it for far too long.
seventeen rounds of interviews and these are the best people they can find? what a joke.
but an excess of caution is not unwarranted in this case.
three days... come back here in three days, and i will show you the evidence.
yeah, belobog is a kind of snowy doomsday city... there are heaters like this all over the place, otherwise people wouldn't survive.
oh really? are you prepared to take responsibility for what you just said?
the summit still reaches just above the water's surface. so, the place known as pilos peak in leonard's day is today known...
sounds great! i heard that they pretty much have no rules over there, right? so people are free to live their life however they want, doing whatever makes them happy.
hee-hee, i'm kidding. anyway, looks like they were willing to hand over some keepsakes, so i guess they knew the deal.
you seek to crush human nature underfoot while masquerading as an... as an arbiter and a god! i cannot let you!
...how about we shove you back in the space station's computer, then?
i, for one, think there's a sizable market for this. approved.
huh? where'd she go? we just saw her go this way.
amazing! so you're a natural poet!
(quit messing around, i'm thinking.)
a great many things are still unaccounted for...
i suppose everyone who likes to bask in the light will be drawn to that kind of warmth...
hehe... well, we can discuss more current affairs if you'd prefer.
leave all further observations to the expert! i'll inform you if anything comes up. mm-hmm, nice working with you.
he may be my subordinate, but he is certainly a qualified poetry expert. and so, we have invited him here tonight to judge the compositions.
so you think we should avoid gepard for the time being, right?
so you just happened to be going the same way... did you see what the outworlder was doing?
ahh, that was amazing. it was so beautiful i could weep.
huh? is his past really that dark?
let me see... what? we're losing market share?
seems like only dan heng has a kind word for my coffee. what do you think? ...well, i've always thought that bitter is better...
but before you do, i would make a request of you.
at present, this is our best, and most logical course of action. after all, a long story deserves a happy ending.
when the time comes, they will gather in the sky above the grand narukami shrine. once their energy is spent, they will be satisfied, and return to where they belong.
ooh, she marched off quickly. so cold.
i'm a little concerned about the auction. i wonder how my secretarial trio is getting along.
so it'll be quite nice to take a break.
ahaa~ you just wanna spend as much time as possible with me before i go, right?
simply write down your riddle and hang it on a lantern. then, venti and i will select a few to pose to the crowd, and you will try to solve them!
for her, though... yes, probably a little too avant-garde.
her power was already on the decline. then you dealt her that fateful strike.
...but i can't see anyone waiting for us. should we look around?
these crates have been sitting here for many years, right? even if they have materials in them, are you sure they are still usable...?
okay, okay, i won't push you -- everyone has their secrets. besides, given the circumstances, my curiosity can wait.
whew... who'd have thought just taking a stroll could be so tiring?
hmm, maybe. let's follow it.
it's a shame no cycranes are installed in that area -- we still have no idea what he was up to. this luocha is getting more suspicious by the minute...
yes? what is it?
why did it run off? aww, i wanted to play with it too!
but it would be incorrect to conclude from this that the inazuma of today is no longer inazuma.
and it's likewise for me. i have a wish i want to achieve so badly in the real world, but i can't. so, i want to give it a shot here...
the underworld has been struggling, but i never tried to help. i didn't even know that it was my own home that had fallen into such a dire state...
i simply need to deduce the missing portions with my astrolabe, write them in, and then decipher the text...
yeah, i wonder how many tickets... hey, that's not what we should be concerned about!
ohh... every time i think of the exam, i get so nervous. only studying or training helps to relieve it a little...
i love their oak cake rolls! i get one from here every day!
allow me to explain: mister boothill and miss black swan submitted a request to temporarily travel with the express for their own personal reasons...
i tend to forget things -- which is why, rather than memories, i'm accustomed to using my emotions to capture what i normally wouldn't otherwise. so...
i'm surprised an outlander like you is aware that there was once a change of electro archon... few citizens of inazuma are aware of this.
yeah, but i guess no one in belobog had much of a clue about video games before the ipc showed up...
the harmonious choir possesses the power of an emanator. to overcome it, you'll need the same level of power. the final step in destroying the sweet dream... will be my responsibility.
if you're interested, go pay her a visit. you may be just the help she needs.
uh-huh, a petite cutie with pink hair. madam herta appointed her to be the acting lead researcher.
you think so? i thought i was rather accommodating. if it had been the shogun... she would have decapitated kujou kamaji without a second thought.
also, this necrosis will diffuse and spread. one piece of the puzzle's mutation will eventually cause the entire building to shake, break... and crumble.
it wouldn't. in the book, the drug only de-ages the body -- it can't repair damage to the soul. in other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
of course photos aren't reality, but if you have enough of them, doesn't reality come a little closer?
*yawn* dear, dear. other players lose their games and throw a tantrum... you win yours, and yet you still find a reason to mope about it.
let's enjoy ourselves first. of course, let's not forget pom-pom's request either.
if you don't take the payment now, i'll be forced to send someone to deliver the package to the arataki gang.
only by doing this can i find a true galaxy ranger and fulfill a long-standing promise...
yes, and had we not come to your rescue, your life would've been over before too much longer. then, the spirit would have haunted your brother until he died of fatigue, too.
"everwinter hill..." what's with all the secrecy? do we really have to go all the way out there to have a chat...?
ah, have you played the chess game i made? or heard of it, perhaps?
i know we've had our run-ins with the ipc, but i'm hoping we can set aside our differences for once, if not just for the sake of the people...
"monster evolution" is an increasingly common theme these days. what started out as a rather niche genre has gradually worked its way into the mainstream.
now... one more option should do it...
whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. did i miss anything big while i was gone?
these rocks have been around for hundreds, maybe even thousands of years. leonard must have lived a very long time ago.
if we can get her to help us, we'll bag a stellaron in no time!
i thought mister tail would possess me and teach me some super cool heliobus swordplay...
by the way, miko mentioned that she founded something called the yae publishing house to sell some sort of... light novels.
don't worry. the script says that i'll experience three "deaths" but also receive an "unforgettable reward" on the planet of festivities.
when the supreme guardian was defeated, the stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing welt and i to contain its power.
oh, please! it's pretty clear they're not talking about you...
let's have some fun with our fungi friends, then take a break to sample some of sumeru's delectable snacks.
the trial of time... i hope it won't waste too much of our time.
hmm, true... if i offended the locals by not knowing their customs, i wouldn't have the chance to learn from them...
in her eyes, the most precious things in this world were dreams -- the yearning for a better future held by living beings.
hey, look. what's that hole in the ground?
an "elixir of immortality"? how'd you cook that up? ugh, leave it to you to work on something like that behind my back...
wow, is that what you two were talking about? amazing... it's huge!
he fooled the silvermane guards into thinking he'd changed... but we won't be falling for that act again any time soon!
oh, am i so incapable of handling even a simple task like this...?
now that you mention it, it kinda does!
isn't this an encryption key for the elevator? with this, we should be able to use the elevator to reach the first floor of the storage zone.
okay! rest up -- you're not allowed to miss the next trailblaze expedition!
let us return. we ought not keep furuyama waiting too long.
miss topaz, i know you've done a lot of research into belobog. i was wondering if there was any information on the engine of creation in your records?
just as i expected from our sophisticated divine foresight. you have a way with words. i like it.
the two lines should be neatly matched, complementing each other both semantically and rhythmically. in essence, it's just like most other forms of poetry.
when i first set foot in the jade chamber, i stood at the edge of the platform and looked down upon liyue harbor far below.
now then, given that the remainder of our discussion pertains to matters of a more... confidential nature... perhaps we could move to the komore teahouse? we ought not to involve other members of the yashiro commission.
it won't be a problem. the fontaine-style dress from the novel shouldn't be too heavy, so it won't affect my abilities.
is it just me, or does the guide sound like it's enjoying itself?
the knowledge passed down to me from my master must be passed on in turn.
so, how about this? i've already assigned a shrine maiden to clear up your little flyers, so at this moment we are a little understaffed at the shrine.
i like your analogy very much. indeed, birds are born to fly, but in a distant past, their ancestors could only gaze at the sky in envy.
i've added new footnotes to my destiny.
*sigh* forget it, it's thanks to you that we got it back in one piece. if you want to call it a rock, call it a rock.
haha. i'm glad you like it too.
...careful. i'm more than certain now that there's something not right about this friend of yours.
oh... goodness, is that the time? i have another guest to receive today. we can talk more back at the grand narukami shrine.
awesome! i've heard that stellaron hunter girl uses this kind of tech -- maybe we can see it in action.
despite this, they were all willing to pay very dearly for them. i wonder... is faith in me really the only factor in their appraisal of the items' value?
since you clearly understand, perhaps you could think about making an effort, too.
the architects said that the guardian's successor is selected from among all people in belobog. the selection process can take anywhere from a few years to a few decades.
people use fireworks to remember their most precious memories, and these memories sparkle and shine each time the fireworks fly.
i think this moment heralds the third time.
ooh, good plan! treat the robots like guard dogs!
maybe i should be thanking cocolia. all she did was push me out... she could've decided to take a more permanent measure.
...we're pretty lucky, huh? without findie, it probably would've taken half the day to find these parts.
thanks for the invite, but i'm afraid my hands are full right now. please send my regards to the supreme guardian.
that's one way to see it, but i believe there is a longer story behind all this. it's best for misha himself to explain all the details...
it's best to be skeptical of her. there's a significant amount of intentional misdirection in her words.
i learned something new today... i never knew that the hydro nation's rock music had the power to stir up lightning.
yeah! we have to help bronya out! the ipc is too big and powerful -- the belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
alright, let's go. hehehe, now this'll make for quite the story!
...if we can start investigating on the way, that'd be good.
for a complete outsider, probing the inner workings of the tenryou commission is nigh on impossible.
...so this mister norbert could well be the museum thief we're looking for?
how about we continue talking on the express? i'll make you a cup of coffee, my special blend.
considering that everyone may have other matters to attend to later, sticking to tea seems like a good idea.
leave this place, return to where you belong, and... awaken penacony from this dream.
that's why he joined wangsheng funeral parlor. in place of a salary, i'm helping him deal with this matter.
was that a message from lady bronya? hm, this theft case has been dragging on for too long -- she must have decided to intervene...
really? i find that hard to believe...
ah, never mind that now. paimon, you were asking about the archon's emissary?
seems like this one's got a temper...
i jest. take it easy, this is indeed your room. i was just passing by...
as always, to follow in the footsteps of akivili.
the prescription's on this side, but on the back there's... huh? so that's what this is all about!?
that's pretty small... and yet... i heard that the reason we were able to arrest those treasure hoarders last time was thanks to captain kaeya's intel.
okay, that's weird...
no sleep for you either, huh?
i went for a stroll on the beach some time ago and sensed a familiar youkai power.
hehe, you're too nice, venti.
good afternoon. it is normal to feel drowsy after lunch, might i interest you in a game of go to stimulate the mind?
i don't? ...i'm sorry to make you worry on my account...
sure enough! these parts are from the museum's sculpture!
nope, but there must be something on the express if pom-pom is getting so worked up.
it's a lot bigger than me, but i should have the upper hand when it comes to strength.
you have wandered the realm in my body, and you appear to have grasped the true essence of eternity.
of course you will, you're both in great health! don't say things like that, it's bad luck.
no! i can't think like that. as a knight, i must rely on my own strength...
hm? go ahead, speak your mind.
i've seen too many people lose their senses on account of things like this. if you want to calm them down, you need to convince them with something tangible.
i feel the same. he's much easier to talk to than that yukong -- their attitudes are so different! maybe that's why she's only a helm master and he's a general...
shh! it's an old astral express escape signal. do you play cards?
so... where are we headed to now, bronya?
hmm? oh, my divination attempts are working again. and the stars say... the fischl i know will obtain a landslide victory.
in fact, i'm certain that sayu remembers her sensei's aspirations for her quite clearly. otherwise, she would have quit the shuumatsuban long ago.
that's right. my people are busy collecting clues now. what's the situation, moze?
some things are inevitable. it's only a matter of time.
i think the guards must have done this intentionally.
my wish has not changed to this very day. however, it is not only out of consideration for myself that i have built the jade chamber anew at this time.
hehe~ honestly, i didn't think about it at all. i just thought it'd be a shame if we didn't try something crazy.
hahaha, don't be daft. you've put my mind at rest. seems it's not easy for ordinary folks to cross over.
*sigh* after having spent all my mora to come to mondstadt, not only have i gained no knowledge, but now i can't return... how did it come to this...
we mustn't fail her determination. i'm not implying that we must win this fight no matter what, but our resolve should match that of the courageous lady.
laying down your challenge only to abscond? despicable!
you took advantage of a child, and you are coming with me to make a full and unreserved apology.
"i disagree with your point of view"... that's what i would say if we were still in the plane of euthymia.
wow, i'm surprised you have the nerve to bring that up again.
you need money for your family, right? take this and show it to a knowledgeable buyer, and they'll instantly know how valuable it is.
when the conductor is ready, we can set off for the next stop.
i want to make each of the chess pieces of liyue millennial as true-to-life as possible.
the objective is clear: find the stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the express. we'll deal with the rest.
well, that's because i only just thought of it. oh, don't look so shocked.
there will come a day when the abominations are completely eliminated -- that's a given. but will we live to see that day? i feel more regret than worry at that prospect.
i'm serious! outdoor explorer, mechanic -- they're both experts in their field, right? i think you two are awesome.
but then... perhaps there's something keeping you from going to the knights?
the antagonists? you mean all the people who behaved foolishly? what can i say, they're bad people and they all got what they deserved. end of story.
i... i must apologize.
she was never a music lover, so... i thought this might be connected to you...
fiendlings, be gone! brilliant enlightenment!
i'll take a look later, and if everything's in order, place it in front of the store.
i was wondering about that too... what happened back there, exactly?
my, my, captain beidou, are you competing with me for talent? that's hardly necessary. you may simply stop by the jade chamber whenever you want the traveler to mix you a drink.
consuming this would be physically detrimental. remove it from my presence.
...i know. but since we were looking for food, i figured we might as well try to fix the stove.
so this is the true reason i can't sing? the shadow that envelops penacony is actually...
*chuckles* and miss out on a great adventure? i don't think you'd like that.
hmm... well, if at that point you felt like coming to the shrine and getting a close-up view of the youkai, i wouldn't say no.
yeah, you just need to tell us what the trouble is, hehe~ general jing yuan pulled out all the stops to get us here -- you can trust us.
if sakujirou still hasn't made up his mind, those two running into each other won't solve anything -- and even worse, there'll be no coming back from it for sakujirou.
another satisfying haul. ah, what a feeling.
all right. let's head to liuli pavilion.
you all have saved belobog from danger time and time again. we don't have much, but we'd like to say thank you with this small gesture.
trailblazers... first time anyone's called us that on this planet!
ha, how daring. snezhnaya's diplomats will answer for this afterward. every last one.
hmm, let me see... huh? it really is someone else's catchphrase...
it's a shame that i forgot to ask her for her name. i only know that she's from the garden of recollection.
to tell you the truth, i've been hoping for an opportunity to spar with you ever since we first met. that wish was half fulfilled today at the exhibition match.
but your "rationality" told you that it was wrong, didn't it?
since we're both here, would you like to train together?
umm... let me put it this way. i was just worried that you might be getting weary, and if you keep pressing on in that state, you might start to lose sight of the things that made you want to start your journey in the first place.
haven't you noticed yet? most of our "convincing" ends in a fight.
and those were real monsters, not a manifestation of your curse.
you're just... trying to make me feel better...
nice to meet you, klee. i'm yoimiya, and i run naganohara fireworks.
something that flies high and far... oh, that makes me think of dandelions.
...a draw? this isn't a tournament, y'know! i can't see many cloud knights -- the xianzhou must have fought well!
even if they left the stars behind them, their trailblaze would not be over. that's also what the conductor thinks, isn't it?
astrology does not exist to please. we astrologists are here to verify and witness the truths of this world.
you saw what happened to that oni samurai's spirit. after leaving the host's body, he was only able to maintain his form for a very short time before disappearing.
hehe... the most important thing is that it's fun. in light novels, as in life, having fun is the most important thing. wouldn't you agree?
sure, gives me time to make a few more adjustments.
he looks about eight or nine years old! and he's already the general's retainer? the xianzhou really does have some child prodigies, huh.
no problem. i will let you try it out as soon as i finish the prototype.
i always get people asking me how my workshop makes money when it's not trading. use your brain! it doesn't!
don't panic, this is normal.
we needn't waste our time, march. she made her decision ten minutes ago.
...wow, you're quick! yes, this exhibit was stolen just recently.
just a suggestion though -- you're safe as long as you stick with me~!
this question... surely it has some connection to the baby bird story -- and this connection is precisely the breakthrough sunday aims to use to persuade us...
well, you're clearly better traveled than i am, and i know how generous you are... i feel embarrassed to ask now...
were they now? good call. i'm pleasantly surprised that they've heard of the astrologist of the century!
...hmm, is this evil fiendling a dragon or a monkey?
you seem to be in a good mood today.
that duel just now was pretty intense. when you dealt the winning blow, not even mister yang could control his excitement. you should've seen him leap out of his chair.
wonderful. then i'll be counting on you to provide my schedule for tomorrow.
don't worry. now that i've experienced the event once already, i won't be easily frightened. i'll see you later. have a lovely chat with your friend.
c'mon, i'll lead the way. once we're done watching the meteor shower, i'll accompany you home.
you may ask me anything, and i will give you an honest answer. i trust that this means of compensation will be to everyone's satisfaction.
thank you very much. it has been richly rewarding to learn from you so far, and i believe my skills with the blade can go even further still.
i never thought a cutie like yourself would be a fan of mine.
we need to get permissions from her? what's she got to do with this?
and i thought i have a way with words, but you certainly take the prize, mister zhongli.
uh... i was just trying to make a joke, but you took it even further?
it wouldn't be right for us to leave like this, so let's help to search for it. there may be other means we can employ besides astrology.
i'm guessing... you two came to talk about them, right?
hey, no worries, you're more than welcome. remember what i said? as long as you've got that little piece of paper, you'll always be a valued customer of the naganoharas.
huh? you want to go to windrise?
hmm, there's quite the crowd here today...
uh... is it that difficult? wait, does this game suck?
although i'm just an ordinary maid, the small task of escorting a visitor to the city is certainly within my power.
which of the starry skies do these thunderbolts fall from?
let's go to mingxing jewelry first, i need to pick up something before meeting them.
it would be weird to call it a coincidence.
i can't cook to save my life, but one thing i'm sure of is: that's a kitchen knife.
"most reliable"? i've got a way to go, but i will try to live up to that!
miss topaz, you mentioned accountability...
that's settled then! there's no time to lose -- we should head out as soon as you're ready.
ah, so you want to be my competitor. well then, i suppose i'll have to start looking over my shoulder.
miss black swan, we fully understand our current predicament now. going back to your original suggestion...
the way it looks to me is that shingo feels terribly resentful to you about something. would you mind telling me what that's all about?
mm... oh! sweet madame is another specialty. crispy skin and tender meat -- goes perfectly with wine!
it would be a terrible shame to let such fascinating individuals slip away out of my reach.
the stellaron might still be an enigma, but the fact of the matter is -- it's a part of you. and you have to embrace this before you can move forward into the future.
my decision to destroy the jade chamber was nowhere near as thought-through as i made it out to be. i just thought we should do what needed to be done, and this was a decision that only i could make.
judging from its appearance, i thought it'd be unpalatable. the wonders of the universe are endless.
what? you're still not ready to go?
especially these days. not only do i have my light novels, but i've also met these two delightfully nosy outlanders.
aaaaaaah--! shhhhahahahaha! that didn't happen! forget it!
or maybe it's just the fruit of your efforts?
also, i'm fairly certain that hilichurls can't write stories. so does this author claim to be documenting hilichurl life from an outside perspective, perhaps?
well then i'm sorry, but what i'm about to say may simply come across as making excuses.
as such, you won't just be sparing much of your invaluable time but also forging new friendships.
this is an aranara carving i bought in port ormos. i heard it's very popular with kids, so here, have one.
i know that it's just like in training, but i always end up worrying i might fail...
in the past, i was ignorant enough to think that i understood all fates in the universe.
but from now on, you should better attend to your duties. there's no need to keep kano nana worrying all the time.
haha, ahh think nothing of it! i could tell from your reaction we were on the same side -- you just didn't know it, y'know?
coming back to this place brings back so many memories, you know...
sure, i understand. i'll be waiting for you here.
maybe this all sounds immature to you, but... i feel just the same way. i want to live life not as kamisato ayaka, but as an ordinary woman.
great! i look forward to learning from your culinary expertise.
you guys must be exhausted standing here all day. how about you take a little lunch break -- i'm sure the ipc allows that, right?
but as long as i'm here, you won't have anything to worry about.
i didn't mean you had to be so formal about it. i need your actions, not your words, hehe.
brother, you seem to be in low spirit... what's happened? is it because of the watchmaker's guest list?
we do? i hadn't realized. i've received rigorous military training -- coordinating with soldiers under any circumstances is easy for me...
if he paid more attention to his affairs, it'd save me a lot of headaches... i guess i do create a few headaches for him too... maybe we're even.
alright, i'll wait for you here. make it quick, though. i can tell you some other stories when you return.
"really? but i don't taste... any difference at all between them."
heh, i'm only telling you this so you can properly understand my plan. could you possibly spare the sentimentality for the time being?
miss topaz, bronya's already told us about belobog's debt situation...
especially the act of overly gratifying oneself using mora. it is both vulgar...
your bluff isn't fooling anyone. if you could really do that, you would have done so earlier.
in my dream, i saw a scorched earth, and a new sapling emerging from it. it bloomed against the morning sun, and whispered to me.
we must all live within the confines of reality, but... call me presumptuous, but i still believe in miracles.
yeah, the little guy here, right? but we all saw him in dreamflux reef, right? and mister yang even greeted him.
...ugh, never mind. it's not like i've got any proof.
rats!? she's playing games with us -- i hate her!
got it! when in rome, as they say! don't worry, conductor, we definitely won't embarrass the nameless.
...i understand your circumstances, serval. i respect your choice.
there's no way someone like him could've come up with the idea of disassembling a sculpture and hiding the pieces inside robots.
aunt gertie, isn't that you in the photo? and old goethe, too! you look so young!
that jolt just now... what's going on? it feels like the entire ship has started to slow down?
don't you worry. you still have a long journey ahead of you... your story has only just begun.
hide-and-seek update... astral express crew -- two, the moles -- zero!
oh...? now that's interesting.
you remember that norbert guy we captured? the silvermane guards have acquired new intel from him -- i thought you might find it interesting.
what i can do is pretend to pull back anyone who believes their time is nigh. but, since the curse is imaginary, our fix will also be make-believe.
isn't a robot shoulder cold to begin with?
thank you for your hard work. if there are any other members who still feel uneasy, please tell them on my behalf that protecting the dreamscape requires everyone's help.
c'mon, this way! as long as we stay quiet, we've got a good chance!
...*sigh* goodness knows why those girls are so carefree about everything. i suppose it falls to me to be extra vigilant.
i... i'm a lawful resident... at least now i am...
i thought that the story between you and the fungi would follow a master-servant paradigm, but you offered something even better: companionship, based on mutual understanding.
in the name of the architects, i shall stick this spear into your nostril!
what? oh right, the password... roast the sausage, not the bread. that's the password, right?
we'll take those invaders out soon, don't worry.
oh right! i completely forgot...*sigh* alright.
well, if that day comes...
it's quite exhilarating to be flushed into the air by soulglad, but... why is the venue still closed when the charmony festival is about to start?
the adventurers' guild? ah, right, you can do commissions for them in exchange for... you know what i mean, don't you?
she sure knows how to boss people around.
and he is an extremely powerful individual! i sensed it the moment i looked at him. he's far more powerful than you'd imagine.
and there's a scarecrow beside it. strange... what is that doing here?
i'm very sorry, but... i actually wasn't planning to join the adventurers' guild at all.
this is a medal given to me by the architects... see that blue stone in the middle? that's a geomarrow crystal of the highest purity.
phew, these steps are so far apart. gotta find a way down...
not a chance! curiosity can be perilous, you know. don't forget my warning, the less you know, the better.
you believe your present self has greater certainty than your former self. thus, you believe your present self is correct. don't you?
almost certainly from his master -- who was also my great-uncle. baizhu's master was my grandpa's younger brother, a former deputy director of wangsheng funeral parlor.
s--so i'll be stricter with you. you need to be more disciplined if you are to understand this world's truths!
the cat is out of the bag... *sigh* alright then, if you insist...
there are too many cards in this game! i can't be expected to learn everything at the drop of a hat.
you're... you're real borisin, aren't you?
ohh, you want to know more about the express? i'm glad. after all, it's an important companion of ours.
hmm, were you distracted during our match?
...what's wrong with those novels? you're not complete unless you've read the tale series!
oh? such a hasty refusal. do you think that's wise? goodness, who knows what tenshukaku would make of this if they heard about it...
what are they feeding you kids down here...
she's been quite ill, and her world has turned upside down. it's been so long since she's been able to see her friend that even her memory of him has become hazy...
many gods used to walk this earth, and many long wars were fought between them that did not abate until two thousand years ago. much blood was shed, and many lives were lost.
i bet the antimatter legion forces never thought they'd be swallowed up by the eternal freeze when they invaded this world.
haha, there will be no loose ends while you're in my company. i already decided where to go while we wait.
though the yashiro commission serves the shogun, it is the people with whom we share close bonds, given the contact we are required to have with them in the performance of our duties.
cleaning up a camp... i guess i do this kind of thing all the time...
mister sampo, what's the purpose of your visit to penacony?
mm-hmm. the object of divine creation is the one who has now taken possession of the gnosis... and the prototype puppet is now known as "the balladeer."
but, so what? i still think he was a nice guy, even if he was a bit weird...
back in this office again... the last time i was here was... the last time i was here.
"doesn't matter what the rules say, if you bring the violence, then the violence is comin' back your way."
got it, the encryption key! quick, before we attract attention, let's--
oh? well hello, what brings you to see me today?
welt may be better equipped to answer that. but if you want my two cents...
why would you tell me your weakness?
they managed to get away again... ugh, i have a feeling this won't be the last we see of them...
or a bookmark in a corner of the library, keys dropped at the side of the road, an unsigned letter of confession stuck in the door of the church...
we've already discussed this together, and our conclusion is... not necessarily.
hmm? what's stopping you? not still traumatized from your last encounter, are you?
i still don't believe this is supposed to be food...
still... i will give them a little more time. after all, they are not the only ones who have made mistakes.
to be honest, i feel the same way.
if i hear any strange new rumors after this, you will be my number one suspect.
...wowwww, i actually managed to get an ipc executive's phone number without even trying.
my, my. yoimiya has quite a determined spirit. i like it very much.
seriously, you even picked a fight while drinking tea. i honestly doubt you have a life at all, let alone a fulfilling one!
...still, belobog is only so big. unless he's brave enough to hide out in the snow plains, we'll catch him sooner or later.
hmm, i see. so the thunderstorm is drawing closer...
gepard? not a chance... he's a decent guy, but also famously uncompromising.
but their leader seems like a reasonable individual. oleg and i have our differences in understanding, but we respect each other's opinion.
i'm sure you must find it quite odd that all these everyday items could fetch such a huge price at auction.
that's what one has to do if they want to get to know someone completely!
one thing though -- we'll need to rewrite the part about me giving you the omamori.
which one is it, "retainer" or "attendant"? make up your mind...
ah! i--i mean... not that madam yukong doesn't have her merits, hehe...
what's going on? why is he chatting with these bugs?
huh, you do seem to travel light. but... don't you at least need some pajamas!?
not at all, venti, you followed my lead most excellently!
i wouldn't have put it past them to try and nab that stellaron from inside you.
thank you! if it's on the way, you can always pick up your fireworks from my house. everything was made in strict accordance with what was on the paper slip, you won't find the slightest thing wrong with them.
there is always a reason for everything. for example, i like to talk because when i was a kid, pops really seemed to enjoy listening to me.
